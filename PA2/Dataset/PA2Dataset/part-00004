Seafood<====>26866<====>Seafood Seafood is any form of sea life regarded as food by humans.  Seafood prominently includes fish and shellfish. Shellfish include various species of molluscs, crustaceans, and echinoderms.  Historically, sea mammals such as whales and dolphins have been consumed as food, though that happens to a lesser extent in modern times.  Edible sea plants, such as some seaweeds and microalgae, are widely eaten as seafood around the world, especially in Asia (see the category of sea vegetables).  In North America, although not generally in the United Kingdom, the term "seafood" is extended to fresh water organisms eaten by humans, so all edible aquatic life may be referred to as seafood. 

SI base unit<====>26872<====>SI base unitThe International System of Units (SI) defines seven units of measure as a basic set from which all other SI units can be derived.  The SI base units and their physical quantities are the metre for measurement of length, the kilogram for mass, the second for time, the ampere for electric current, the kelvin for temperature, the candela for luminous intensity, and the mole for amount of substance. The SI base units form a set of mutually independent dimensions as required by dimensional analysis commonly employed in science and technology. The names and symbols of SI base units are written in lowercase, except the symbols of those named after a person, which are written with an initial capital letter. 

Second<====>26873<====>Second   The second (symbol: s) (abbreviated s or sec) is the base unit of time in the International System of Units (SI). It is qualitatively defined as the second division of the hour by sixty, the first division by sixty being the minute.   The SI definition of second is "the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom".    Seconds may be measured using a mechanical, electrical or an atomic clock. 

Metric prefix<====>26874<====>Metric prefix  A metric prefix is a unit prefix that precedes a basic unit of measure to indicate a multiple or fraction of the unit.  While all metric prefixes in common use today are decadic, historically there have been a number of binary metric prefixes as well.   Each prefix has a unique symbol that is prepended to the unit symbol.  The prefix kilo-, for example, may be added to gram to indicate multiplication by one thousand: one kilogram is equal to one thousand grams.  The prefix milli-, likewise, may be added to metre to indicate division by one thousand; one millimetre is equal to one thousandth of a metre. 

SI derived unit<====>26876<====>SI derived unit The International System of Units (SI) specifies a set of seven base units from which all other SI units of measurement are derived.  These SI derived units are either dimensionless, or can be expressed as a product of one or more of the base units, possibly scaled by an appropriate power of exponentiation. Many derived units do not have special names.  For example, the SI derived unit of area is the square metre (m 2 ) and the SI derived unit of density is the kilogram per cubic metre (kg/m 3  or kg m −3 ). 

Split (poker)<====>26882<====>Split (poker) In poker it is sometimes necessary to split, or divide the pot among two or more players rather than awarding it all to a single player.   This can happen because of ties, and also by playing intentional split-pot poker variants (the most typical of these is high-low split poker, where the high hand and low hand split the pot). To split a pot, one player uses both hands to take the chips from the pot and make stacks, placing them side by side to compare height (and therefore value).   Equal stacks are placed aside. 

Superconductivity<====>26884<====>SuperconductivitySuperconductivity is a phenomenon of exactly zero electrical resistance and expulsion of magnetic flux fields occurring in certain materials, called superconductors, when cooled below a characteristic critical temperature.  It was discovered by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes on April 8, 1911, in Leiden.  Like ferromagnetism and atomic spectral lines, superconductivity is a quantum mechanical phenomenon.  It is characterized by the Meissner effect, the complete ejection of magnetic field lines from the interior of the superconductor as it transitions into the superconducting state.  The occurrence of the Meissner effect indicates that superconductivity cannot be understood simply as the idealization of perfect conductivity in classical physics.

The Swedes, most of who are computer literate, enjoy a continuous growth in the Internet market and the availability of technologies such as Metro Ethernet, fiber, satellite, WAN access technologies and even the availability of 3G services. 

Transport in Sweden<====>26894<====>Transport in Sweden Transportation in Sweden is carried out by car, bus, train, boat or aeroplane. Railways Rail transport is operated by SJ, DSBFirst, Green Cargo, Tågkompaniet and more.  Most counties have companies that do ticketing, marketing and financing of local passenger rail, but the actual operation are done by the above-mentioned companies.

Swedish Armed Forces<====>26895<====>Swedish Armed Forces The Swedish Armed Forces ( , literally “Defense Force”) is the government agency that forms the military forces of Sweden, and which is tasked with defence of the country, as well as promoting Sweden's wider interests, supporting international peacekeeping efforts, and providing humanitarian aid. It consists of: the Swedish Army, the Swedish Air Force and the Swedish Navy, with addition of a military reserve force, the Home Guard ( ).  Since 1994, all the Swedish armed services are organised within a single unified government agency, headed by the Supreme Commander, even though the individual services maintain their distinct identities. 

Foreign relations of Sweden<====>26896<====>Foreign relations of Sweden The foreign policy of Sweden is based on the premise that national security is best served by staying free of alliances in peacetime in order to remain a neutral country in the event of war.  In 2002, Sweden revised its security doctrine.  The security doctrine still states that "Sweden pursues a policy of non-participation in military alliances," but permits cooperation in response to threats against peace and security.  The government also seeks to maintain Sweden's high standard of living.  These two objectives require heavy expenditures for social welfare, defense spending at rates considered low by Western European standards (currently around 1. 

Spice<====>26897<====>Spice    A spice is a seed, fruit, root, bark, or other plant substance primarily used for flavoring, coloring or preserving food.  Spices are distinguished from herbs, which are the leaves, flowers, or stems of plants used for flavoring or as a garnish.  Many spices have antimicrobial properties.  This may explain why spices are more commonly used in warmer climates, which have more infectious diseases, and why the use of spices is prominent in meat, which is particularly susceptible to spoiling.Spices are sometimes used in medicine, religious rituals, cosmetics or perfume production, or as a vegetable . 

Sect<====>26898<====>Sect  A sect is a subgroup of a religious, political, or philosophical belief system, usually an offshoot of a larger group.  Although the term was originally a classification for religious separated groups, it can now refer to any organization that breaks away from a larger one to follow a different set of rules and principles.  In an Indian context, sect refers to an organized tradition.  EtymologyThe word sect comes from the Latin noun secta (a feminine form of a variant past participle of the verb sequi, to follow   ), meaning "a way, road", and figuratively a (prescribed) way, mode, or manner, and hence metonymously, a discipline or school of thought as defined by a set of methods and doctrines.

Solar System<====>26903<====>Solar SystemThe Solar System Capitalization of the name varies.  The International Astronomical Union, the authoritative body regarding astronomical nomenclature, specifies capitalizing the names of all individual astronomical objects, but uses mixed "Solar System" and "solar system" in their naming guidelines document.  The name is commonly rendered in lower case ("solar system"), as, for example, in the Oxford English Dictionary and Merriam-Webster's 11th Collegiate Dictionary.   is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly.  The natural satellites (moons) orbiting the Solar System's planets are an example of the latter. 

Silurian<====>26904<====>Silurian  The Silurian is a geologic period and system spanning 24. 6 million years from the end of the Ordovician Period, at   million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Devonian Period,   Mya.As with other geologic periods, the rock beds that define the period's start and end are well identified, but the exact dates are uncertain by several million years.  The base of the Silurian is set at a major Ordovician–Silurian extinction events when 60% of marine species were wiped out. A significant evolutionary milestone during the Silurian was the diversification of jawed and bony fish. 

Siege<====>26905<====>Siege  A siege is a military blockade of a city, or fortress, with the intent of conquering by attrition, or a well-prepared assault.  This derives from sedere, Latin for "to sit".  Merriam-Webster: siege  Siege warfare is a form of constant, low-intensity conflict characterized by one party holding a strong, static, defensive position.  Consequently, an opportunity for negotiation between combatants is not uncommon, as proximity and fluctuating advantage can encourage diplomacy. A siege occurs when an attacker encounters a city or fortress that cannot be easily taken by a quick assault, and which refuses to surrender. 

Semantic dispute<====>26906<====>Semantic dispute For semantic arguments in linguistics, see verb argument. A semantic dispute is a disagreement that arises if the parties involved disagree about the definition of a word or phrase, not because they disagree on material facts, but rather because they disagree on the definitions of a word (or several words) essential to formulating the claim at issue.  It is sometimes held that semantic disputes are not genuine disputes at all, but very often they are regarded as perfectly genuine, e. g. , in philosophy.  It is also sometimes held that when a semantic dispute arises, the focus of the debate should switch from the original thesis to the meaning of the terms of which there are different definitions (understandings, concepts, etc. 

Saint Lawrence Seaway<====>26908<====>Saint Lawrence Seaway The Saint Lawrence Seaway ( ) is a system of locks, canals and channels in Canada and the United States that permit ocean-going vessels to travel from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes of North America, as far inland as the western end of Lake Superior.  The Seaway is named for the Saint Lawrence River, which flows from Lake Ontario to the Atlantic Ocean.  Legally, the Seaway extends from Montreal, Quebec, to Lake Erie and includes the Welland Canal. This section upstream of the Seaway is not a continuous canal; rather, it consists of several stretches of navigable channels within the river, a number of locks, and canals along the banks of the St. 

Silvio Berlusconi<====>26909<====>Silvio Berlusconi Silvio Berlusconi ( ; born 29 September 1936) is an Italian media tycoon and politician who served as Prime Minister of Italy in four governments. Berlusconi is the controlling shareholder of Mediaset and owned the Italian football club A. C.  Milan from 1986 to 2017.  He is nicknamed Il Cavaliere (The Knight) for his Order of Merit for Labour, although he voluntarily resigned from this order in March 2014.   In 2017, Forbes magazine ranked him as the 199th richest man in the world with a net worth of US$7. 

Sprung rhythm<====>26911<====>Sprung rhythm Sprung rhythm is a poetic rhythm designed to imitate the rhythm of natural speech.  It is constructed from feet in which the first syllable is stressed and may be followed by a variable number of unstressed syllables.   The British poet Gerard Manley Hopkins said he discovered this previously unnamed poetic rhythm in the natural patterns of English in folk songs, spoken poetry, Shakespeare, Milton, et al.  He used diacritical marks on syllables to indicate which should be drawn out (acute e. g.  á ) and which uttered quickly (grave, e. g. , è). 

Sapindales<====>26912<====>Sapindales Sapindales   is an order of flowering plants.  Well-known members of Sapindales include citrus; maples, horse-chestnuts, lychees and rambutans; mangos and cashews; frankincense and myrrh; mahogany and neem. The APG III system of 2009 includes it in the clade malvids (in rosids, in eudicots) with the following nine families:AnacardiaceaeBiebersteiniaceaeBurseraceaeKirkiaceaeMeliaceaeNitrariaceae (including Peganaceae and Tetradiclidaceae)RutaceaeSapindaceaeSimaroubaceaeThe APG II system of 2003 allowed the optional segregation of families now included in the Nitrariaceae. In the classification system of Dahlgren the Rutaceae were placed in the order Rutales, in the superorder Rutiflorae (also called Rutanae).  The Cronquist system of 1981 used a somewhat different circumscription, including the following families:StaphyleaceaeMelianthaceaeBretschneideraceaeAkaniaceaeSapindaceaeHippocastanaceaeAceraceaeBurseraceaeAnacardiaceaeJulianiaceaeSimaroubaceaeCneoraceaeMeliaceaeRutaceaeZygophyllaceaeThe difference from the APG III system is not as large as may appear, as the plants in the families Aceraceae and Hippocastanaceae stay in this order at APG III (both included in family Sapindaceae). 

Solanales<====>26913<====>Solanales The Solanales are an order of flowering plants, included in the asterid group of dicotyledons.   Some older sources used the name Polemoniales for this order. TaxonomyUnder the older Cronquist system, the latter three families were placed elsewhere, and a number of others were included:Family Duckeodendraceae (now treated as a synonym of Solanaceae)Family Nolanaceae (now treated as a synonym of Solanaceae)Family Cuscutaceae (now treated as a synonym of Convolvulaceae)Family Retziaceae (now treated as a synonym of Stilbaceae, order Lamiales)Family Menyanthaceae (now placed in order Asterales)Family Polemoniaceae (now placed in order Ericales)Family Hydrophyllaceae (now treated as a synonym of Boraginaceae)In the classification system of Dahlgren the Solanales were in the superorder Solaniflorae (also called Solananae). 

Sheepshead (game)<====>26914<====>Sheepshead (game)   Sheepshead or Sheephead is a trick-taking card game related to the Skat family of games.  It is the Americanized version of a card game that originated in Central Europe in the late 18th century under the German name Schafkopf.  Sheepshead is most commonly played by five players, Sheepshead Basic Rules, sheepshead. org, Retrieved January 27, 2016  but variants exist to allow for two to eight players.  There are also many other variants to the game rules, and many slang terms used with the game. Although Schafkopf literally means "sheepshead," it has nothing to do with sheep; the term probably was derived and translated incorrectly from Middle High German and referred to playing cards on a barrel head (from kopf, meaning head, and Schaff, meaning a barrel). 

Linguistic relativity<====>26915<====>Linguistic relativityThe principle of linguistic relativity holds that the structure of a language affects its speakers' world view or cognition.  Popularly known as the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, or Whorfianism, the principle is often defined to include two versions.  The strong version says that language determines thought and that linguistic categories limit and determine cognitive categories, whereas the weak version says that linguistic categories and usage only influence thought and decisions. The term "Sapir–Whorf hypothesis" is considered a misnomer by linguists for several reasons: Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf never co-authored any works, and never stated their ideas in terms of a hypothesis. 

Statute of limitations<====>26917<====>Statute of limitationsStatutes of limitations are laws passed by legislative bodies in common law systems to set the maximum time after an event within which legal proceedings may be initiated.    When the period of time specified in a statute of limitations passes, a claim might no longer be filed, or, if filed, may be liable to be struck out if the defense against that claim is, or includes, that the claim is time-barred as having been filed after the statutory limitations period.  When a statute of limitations expires in a criminal case, the courts no longer have jurisdiction. 

Submarine sandwich<====>26918<====>Submarine sandwich  A submarine, also known as a sub, hoagie, hero, filled roll, grinder, wedge, spukie, or Italian sandwich, is the name given in the United States to a type of sandwich that consists of a length of bread or  roll split lengthwise and filled with a variety of meats, cheeses, vegetables, and condiments.The sandwich has no standardized name,  with over a dozen variations used around the world.Larger submarine sandwiches, particularly those that are longer in length or overstuffed with greater quantities of ingredients than usual, are sometimes called battleship sandwiches or destroyer sandwiches. 

Semitic languages<====>26919<====>Semitic languages The Semitic languages   are a branch of the Afroasiatic language family originating in the Middle East.  Semitic languages are spoken by more than 330 million people across much of Western Asia, North Africa and the Horn of Africa, as well as in often large expatriate communities in North America and Europe, with smaller communities in the Caucasus and Central Asia.  The terminology was first used in the 1780s by members of the Göttingen School of History,  who derived the name from Shem, one of the three sons of Noah in the Book of Genesis.

Spinning (textiles)<====>26948<====>Spinning (textiles)Spinning is the twisting together of drawn-out strands of fibers to form yarn, and is a major part of the textile industry.  The yarn is then used to create textiles, which are then used to make clothing and many other products.  There are several industrial processes available to spin yarn, as well as hand-spinning techniques where the fiber is drawn out, twisted, and wound onto a bobbin. Types of fibreArtificial fibres are made by extruding a polymer through a spinneret into a medium where it hardens.  Wet spinning (rayon) uses a coagulating medium.   In dry spinning (acetate and triacetate), the polymer is contained in a solvent that evaporates in the heated exit chamber. 

Republics of the Soviet Union<====>26950<====>Republics of the Soviet UnionThe Republics of the Soviet Union or the Union Republics ( ) of the Soviet Union were ethnically based proto-states that were subordinated directly to the Government of the Soviet Union.   For most of its history, the Soviet Union was a highly centralized state; the decentralization reforms during the era of Perestroika ("Restructuring") and Glasnost ("Openness") conducted by Mikhail Gorbachev led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. OverviewAccording to Article 76 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution, a Union Republic was a sovereign Soviet socialist state that had united with other Soviet Republics in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. 

Systemic scleroderma<====>26951<====>Systemic scleroderma Systemic scleroderma, also called diffuse scleroderma or systemic sclerosis, is an autoimmune disease of the connective tissue.  It is characterized by thickening of the skin caused by accumulation of collagen, and by injuries to small arteries.  There are two forms of scleroderma: localized and systemic.  The localized (limited) form affects the skin of only the face, hands, and feet.  The systemic (diffuse) form involves those and, in addition, may progress to visceral organs, including the kidneys, heart, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract. Prognosis is determined by the form of the disease and the extent of visceral involvement. 

Slave narrative<====>26952<====>Slave narrativeThe slave narrative is a type of literary work that is made up of the written accounts of enslaved Africans in Great Britain and its colonies, including the later United States, Canada, and Caribbean nations.

Silent film<====>26956<====>Silent film  A silent film is a film with no synchronized recorded sound, especially with no spoken dialogue.  In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards with a written indication of the plot or key dialogue.  The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was made practical only in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system.  During the silent film era (from the mid 1890s to the late 1920s), a pianist, theater organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. 

Shia Islam<====>26961<====>Shia Islam  Shia ( ;   Shīʿah, from Shīʻatu ʻAlī, "followers of Ali") is a branch of Islam which holds that the Islamic prophet Muhammad designated Ali ibn Abi Talib as his successor (Imam).   Shia Islam primarily contrasts with Sunni Islam, whose adherents believe that Muhammad did not appoint a successor and consider Abu Bakr (who was appointed Caliph through a Shura, i. e.  community consensus) to be the correct Caliph.   Unlike the first three Rashidun caliphs, Ali was from the same clan as Muhammad, Banu Hashim.  Adherents of Shia Islam are called Shias of Ali, Shias or the Shi'a as a collective or Shi'i individually. 

Special relativity<====>26962<====>Special relativity  In physics, special relativity (SR, also known as the special theory of relativity or STR) is the generally accepted and experimentally well-confirmed physical theory regarding the relationship between space and time.  In Albert Einstein's original pedagogical treatment, it is based on two postulates:The laws of physics are invariant (i. e.  identical) in all inertial systems (non-accelerating frames of reference). The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source. It was originally proposed by Albert Einstein in a paper published 26 September 1905 titled "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies".

Salinity<====>26985<====>Salinity Salinity is the saltiness or amount of salt dissolved in a body of water (see also soil salinity).  This is usually measured in  \frac{g \ \textrm{salt}}{kg \  \textrm{sea} \  \textrm{water}}  (note that this is technically dimensionless).  Salinity is an important factor in determining many aspects of the chemistryof natural waters and of biological processes within it, and is a thermodynamic state variable that, along with temperature and pressure, governs physical characteristics like the density and heat capacity of the water. A contour line of constant salinity is called an isohaline, or sometimes isohale.

In this definition, scientific refers to the empirical investigation using the scientific method.  The terms thoughts, feelings, and behaviors refer to psychological variables that can be measured in humans.  The statement that others' presence may be imagined or implied suggests that humans are malleable to social influences even when alone, such as when watching television or following internalized cultural norms.  Social psychologists typically explain human behavior as a result of the interaction of mental states and social situations.

Shire<====>26995<====>Shire    A  shire is a traditional term for a division of land, found in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and some other English speaking countries.  It was first used in Wessex from the beginning of Anglo-Saxon settlement, and spread to most of the rest of England in the tenth century.  In some rural parts of Australia, a shire is a local government area; however, in Australia it is not synonymous with a "county", which is a lands administrative division. EtymologyThe word derives from the Old English scir, itself a derivative of the Proto-Germanic skizo (cf. 

Scientist<====>26997<====>Scientist  A scientist is a person engaging in a systematic activity to acquire knowledge that describes and predicts the natural world.  In a more restricted sense, a scientist may refer to an individual who uses the scientific method.   The person may be an expert in one or more areas of science.   The term scientist was coined by the theologian, philosopher and historian of science William Whewell in 1833.  This article focuses on the more restricted use of the word.  Scientists perform research toward a more comprehensive understanding of nature, including physical, mathematical and social realms. 

Smog<====>27000<====>Smog   Smog is a type of air pollutant.  The word "smog" was coined in the early 20th century as a portmanteau of the words smoke and fog to refer to smoky fog, its opacity, and odour.    The word was then intended to refer to what was sometimes known as pea soup fog, a familiar and serious problem in London from the 19th century to the mid 20th century.  This kind of visible air pollution is composed of nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, ozone, smoke or dirt particles and also less visible particles such as CFC's. 

Smoke<====>27001<====>Smoke  Smoke  is a collection of airborne solid and liquid particulates and gases  emitted when a material undergoes combustion or pyrolysis, together with the quantity of air that is entrained or otherwise mixed into the mass.  It is commonly an unwanted by-product of fires (including stoves, candles, oil lamps, and fireplaces), but may also be used for pest control (fumigation), communication (smoke signals), defensive and offensive capabilities in the military (smoke screen), cooking, or smoking (tobacco, cannabis, etc. ).  Smoke is used in rituals where incense, sage, or resin is burned to produce a smell for spiritual purposes. 

Tobacco pipe<====>27002<====>Tobacco pipe  A tobacco pipe, often called simply a pipe, is a device specifically made to smoke tobacco.  It comprises a chamber (the bowl) for the tobacco from which a thin hollow stem (shank) emerges, ending in a mouthpiece (the bit).  Pipes can range from very simple machine-made briar models to highly prized hand-made artisanal implements made by renowned pipemakers, which are often very expensive collector's items.  Pipe smoking is the oldest known traditional form of tobacco smoking. History  Smoking pipes of various types have been used since ancient times.  Herodotus described Scythians inhaling the fumes of burning leaves in 500 B. 

Swiss cheese<====>27003<====>Swiss cheese    Swiss cheese is a generic name in North America for several related varieties of cheese, mainly of North American manufacture, which resemble Emmental cheese, a yellow, medium-hard cheese that originated in the area around Emmental, in Switzerland.  Some types of Swiss cheese have a distinctive appearance, as the blocks of the cheese are riddled with holes known as "eyes".  Swiss cheese without eyes is known as "blind".   (The term is applied to cheeses of this style made outside Switzerland, such as Jarlsberg cheese, which originates in Norway). ProductionThree types of bacteria are used in the production of Emmental cheese: Streptococcus salivarius subspecies thermophilus, Lactobacillus (Lactobacillus helveticus or Lactobacillus delbrueckii subspecies bulgaricus), and Propionibacterium (Propionibacterium freudenreichii subspecies shermani). 

Smoke signal<====>27005<====>Smoke signal The smoke signal is one of the oldest forms of long-distance communication.  It is a form of visual communication used over long distance.   In general smoke signals are used to transmit news, signal danger, or gather people to a common area. History and usageIn ancient China, soldiers stationed along the Great Wall would alert each other of impending enemy attack by signaling from tower to tower.  In this way, they were able to transmit a message as far away as    in just a few hours. Abuse of the smoke signal is known to have contributed to the fall of the Western Zhou Dynasty in the 8th century BCE. 

Serendipity<====>27006<====>Serendipity   Serendipity means a "fortunate or happy unplanned coincidence".  The term was coined by Horace Walpole in 1754.  In a letter he wrote to his friend Horace Mann, Walpole explained an unexpected discovery he had made about a (lost) painting  of Bianca Cappello by Giorgio Vasari by reference to a  Persian fairy tale, The Three Princes of Serendip.  The princes, he told his correspondent, were "always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things which they were not in quest of". The notion of serendipity is a common occurrence throughout the history of scientific innovation. 

Samuel Morse<====>27007<====>Samuel Morse   Samuel Finley Breese Morse (April 27, 1791 – April 2, 1872) was an American painter and inventor.  After having established his reputation as a portrait painter, in his middle age Morse contributed to the invention of a single-wire telegraph system based on European telegraphs.  He was a co-developer of the Morse code and helped to develop the commercial use of telegraphy. Birth and educationSamuel F.  B.  Morse was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts, the first child of the pastor Jedidiah Morse (1761–1826), who was also a geographer, and his wife Elizabeth Ann Finley Breese (1766–1828). 

Ship<====>27008<====>Ship    }  A ship is a large watercraft that travels the world's oceans and other sufficiently deep waterways, carrying passengers or goods, or in support of specialized missions, such as defense, research and fishing.  Historically, a "ship" was a sailing vessel with at least three square-rigged masts and a full bowsprit.  Ships are generally distinguished from boats, based on size, shape, load capacity, and tradition. Ships have been important contributors to human migration and commerce.  They have supported the spread of colonization and the slave trade, but have also served scientific, cultural, and humanitarian needs. 

Soap opera<====>27009<====>Soap opera   A soap opera or soap, is a serial drama on television or radio that examines the lives of many characters, usually focusing on emotional relationships to the point of melodrama.

The SEI also works closely with industry and academia through research collaborations. On November 14, 1984, the U. S.  Department of Defense elected Carnegie Mellon University as the host site of the Software Engineering Institute.   The institute was founded with an initial allocation of $6 million, with another $97 million to be allocated in the subsequent five years. 

Software crisis<====>27012<====>Software crisis Software crisis is a term used in the early days of computing science for the difficulty of writing useful and efficient computer programs in the required time.  The software crisis was due to the rapid increases in computer power and the complexity of the problems that could not be tackled.  With the increase in the complexity of the software, many software problems arose because existing methods were insufficient. The term "software crisis" was coined by some attendees at the first NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968 at Garmisch, Germany.   Edsger Dijkstra's 1972 ACM Turing Award Lecture makes reference to this same problem:    The causes of the software crisis were linked to the overall complexity of hardware and the software development process.

South Korea<====>27019<====>South Korea South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (abbreviated ROK), is a sovereign state in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula.Officially, its territory consists of the whole Korean Peninsula and its adjacent islands,  which are largely mountainous.  South Koreans lead a distinctive urban lifestyle, as half of them live in high-rises  concentrated in the Seoul Capital Area with 25 million residents.   The capital Seoul is the world's sixth leading global city  with the fifth largest economy  and is the seventh most sustainable city in the world. 

History of South Korea<====>27020<====>History of South Korea   The history of South Korea formally begins with its establishment on 17 August 1948, although Syngman Rhee had officially declared independence two days prior. Korea was administratively partitioned in 1945, at the end of World War II.  As Korea was under Japanese rule during World War II, Korea was officially a belligerent against the Allied Powers.  The unconditional surrender of Japan led to the division of Korea into two occupation zones (similar to the four zones in Germany), with the United States administering the southern half of the peninsula and the Soviet Union administering the area north of the 38th parallel. 

Geography of South Korea<====>27021<====>Geography of South Korea  South Korea is located in East Asia, on the southern half of the Korean Peninsula jutting out from the far east of the Asian land mass.  The only country with a land border to South Korea is North Korea, lying to the north with   of border running along the Korean Demilitarized Zone.  South Korea is mostly surrounded by water and has   of coast line along three seas.  To the west is the Yellow Sea, to the south is the East China Sea, and to the east is Ulleung-do and Liancourt Rocks in the   (East Sea). 

Demographics of South Korea<====>27022<====>Demographics of South Korea  This article is about the demographic features of the population of South Korea, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population. In June 2012, South Korea's population reached 50 million.   Since the 2000s, South Korea has been struggling with a low birthrate, leading some studies to suggest that if current population trends hold, the country's population will be extinct by the year 2750.   Background Although a variety of different Asian peoples had migrated to the Korean Peninsula in past centuries, very few have remained permanently, so by 1990 both South Korea and North Korea were among the world's most ethnically homogeneous nations. 

Politics of South Korea<====>27023<====>Politics of South Korea   Politics of the Republic of Korea takes place in the framework of a presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the President is the head of state, and of a multi-party system.  Executive power is exercised by the government.  Legislative power is vested in both the government and the National Assembly.

Shot reverse shot<====>27035<====>Shot reverse shot  Shot reverse shot (or shot/countershot) is a film technique where one character is shown looking at another character (often off-screen), and then the other character is shown looking back at the first character.  Since the characters are shown facing in opposite directions, the viewer assumes that they are looking at each other.ContextShot reverse shot is a feature of the "classical" Hollywood style of continuity editing, which deemphasizes transitions between shots such that the spectator perceives one continuous action that develops linearly, chronologically, and logically.  It is an example of an eyeline match. 

Stop motion<====>27036<====>Stop motion Stop motion (hyphenated stop-motion when used as an adjective) is an animation technique that physically manipulates an object so that it appears to move on its own.

Because of its high tensile strength and low cost, it is a major component used in buildings, infrastructure, tools, ships, automobiles, machines, appliances, and weapons. Iron is the base metal of steel.  Iron is able to take on two crystalline forms (allotropic forms), body centered cubic (BCC) and face centered cubic (FCC), depending on its temperature.   In the body-centred cubic arrangement, there is an iron atom in the centre of each cube, and in the face-centred cubic, there is one at the center of each of the six faces of the cube. 

Stainless steel<====>27059<====>Stainless steel In metallurgy, stainless steel, also known as inox steel or inox from French inoxydable ( ), is a steel alloy with a minimum of 10. 5% chromium content by mass.  Stainless steels are notable for their corrosion resistance, which increases with increasing chromium content.  Molybdenum additions increase corrosion resistance in reducing acids and against pitting attack in chloride solutions.  Thus, there are numerous grades of stainless steel with varying chromium and molybdenum contents to suit the environment the alloy must endure. Stainless steel differs from carbon steel due to the presence of chromium.  Unprotected carbon steel rusts readily when exposed to the combination of air and moisture.

Standardization<====>27065<====>StandardizationStandardization or standardisation is the process of implementing and developing technical standards based on the consensus of different parties that include firms, users, interest groups, standards organizations and governments  Standardization can help to maximize compatibility, interoperability, safety, repeatability, or quality.  It can also facilitate commoditization of formerly custom processes.  In social sciences, including economics,    the idea of standardization is close to the solution for a coordination problem, a situation in which all parties can realize mutual gains, but only by making mutually consistent decisions.  This view includes the case of "spontaneous standardization processes", to produce de facto standards.

Secularism<====>27113<====>SecularismSecularism is the principle of the separation of government institutions and persons mandated to represent the state from religious institution and religious dignitaries (the attainment of such is termed secularity).  One manifestation of secularism is asserting the right to be free from religious rule and teachings, or, in a state declared to be neutral on matters of belief, from the imposition by government of religion or religious practices upon its people.  See also Separation of church and state and Laïcité.   Another manifestation of secularism is the view that public activities and decisions, especially political ones, should be uninfluenced by religious beliefs or practices. 

Silicon<====>27114<====>SiliconSilicon is a chemical element with symbol Si and atomic number 14.  A hard and brittle crystalline solid with a blue-grey metallic lustre, it is a tetravalent metalloid and semiconductor.  It is a member of group 14 in the periodic table, along with carbon above it and germanium, tin, and lead below.  It is rather unreactive, though less so than germanium, and has a very large chemical affinity for oxygen; as such, it was first prepared and characterized in pure form only in 1823 by Jöns Jakob Berzelius.  Silicon is the eighth most common element in the universe by mass, but very rarely occurs as the pure element in the Earth's crust. 

Scandium<====>27116<====>Scandium    Scandium is a chemical element with symbol Sc and atomic number 21.  A silvery-white metallic d-block element, it has historically been classified as a rare earth element,  together with yttrium and the lanthanides.  It was discovered in 1879 by spectral analysis of the minerals euxenite and gadolinite from Scandinavia. Scandium is present in most of the deposits of rare-earth and uranium compounds, but it is extracted from these ores in only a few mines worldwide.  Because of the low availability and the difficulties in the preparation of metallic scandium, which was first done in 1937, applications for scandium were not developed until the 1970s. 

Selenium<====>27117<====>Selenium  Selenium is a chemical element with symbol Se and atomic number 34.  It is a nonmetal with properties that are intermediate between the elements above and below in the periodic table, sulfur and tellurium, and also has similarities to arsenic.  It rarely occurs in its elemental state or as pure ore compounds in the Earth's crust.  Selenium (Greek σελήνη selene meaning "Moon") was discovered in 1817 by Jöns Jacob Berzelius, who noted the similarity of the new element to the previously discovered tellurium (named for the Earth). Selenium is found in metal sulfide ores, where it partially replaces the sulfur. 

Strontium<====>27118<====>Strontium  Strontium is the chemical element with symbol Sr and atomic number 38.  An alkaline earth metal, strontium is a soft silver-white yellowish metallic element that is highly reactive chemically.  The metal forms a dark oxide layer when it is exposed to air.  Strontium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of its two vertical neighbors in the periodic table, calcium and barium.  It occurs naturally in the minerals celestine, strontianite, and putnisite, and is mined mostly from the first two of these.  While natural strontium is stable, the synthetic  90 Sr isotope is radioactive and is one of the most dangerous components of nuclear fallout, as strontium is absorbed by the body in a similar manner to calcium. 

Silver<====>27119<====>Silver    Silver is a chemical element with symbol Ag (from the Latin  , derived from the Greek ἀργός: "shiny" or "white") and atomic number 47.  A soft, white, lustrous transition metal, it exhibits the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and reflectivity of any metal.  The metal is found in the Earth's crust in the pure, free elemental form ("native silver"), as an alloy with gold and other metals, and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite.  Most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper, gold, lead, and zinc refining. Silver has long been valued as a precious metal. 

Sorbian languages<====>27120<====>Sorbian languagesThe Sorbian languages (Upper Sorbian: Serbsce; Lower Sorbian: Serbski) are two closely related, but only partially mutually intelligible, West Slavic languages spoken by the Sorbs, a West Slavic minority in the Lusatia region of eastern Germany.  They are classified under the West Slavic branch of the Indo-European languages and are therefore closely related to the other two West Slavic subgroups: Lechitic and Czech–Slovak.  About Sorbian Language, by Helmut Faska, University of Leipzig (English)  Historically the languages have also been known as Wendish (named after the Wends, earliest Slavic people in modern Poland and Germany) or Lusatian. 

Samarium<====>27121<====>Samarium Samarium is a chemical element with symbol Sm and atomic number 62.  It is a moderately hard silvery metal that slowly oxidizes in air.  Being a typical member of the lanthanide series, samarium usually assumes the oxidation state +3.  Compounds of samarium(II) are also known, most notably the monoxide SmO, monochalcogenides SmS, SmSe and SmTe, as well as samarium(II) iodide.  The last compound is a common reducing agent in chemical synthesis.  Samarium has no significant biological role but is only slightly toxic. Samarium was discovered in 1879 by the French chemist Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran and named after the mineral samarskite from which it was isolated. 

Sami people<====>27122<====>Sami people    The Sami people (also known as the Sámi or the Saami, or traditionally known in English as the Lapps or the Laplanders) are a Finno-Ugric people inhabiting Sápmi, which today encompasses large parts of Norway and Sweden, northern parts of Finland, and the Murmansk Oblast of Russia.   The Sami are the only indigenous people in Scandinavia that are recognized and protected under the international conventions of indigenous peoples, and are hence one of the northernmost indigenous people of Europe.   Sami ancestral lands are not well-defined.  Their traditional languages are the Sami languages and are classified as a branch of the Uralic language family.

Structuralist film theory<====>27153<====>Structuralist film theoryStructuralist film theory is a branch of film theory that is rooted in structuralism, itself based on structural linguistics.  OverviewStructuralist film theory emphasizes how films convey meaning through the use of codes and conventions not dissimilar to the way languages are used to construct meaning in communication.  However, structuralist film theory differs from linguistic theory in that its codifications include a more apparent temporal aspect.  In other words, the site of the study (the film) is moving in time and must be analyzed in a framework which can consider its temporality.  To that end, structuralist film theory is dependent on a new kind of sign, first proposed by the Prague linguistic circle, dubbed the ostensive sign. 

Epileptic seizure<====>27154<====>Epileptic seizure   An epileptic seizure, also known as an epileptic fit, is a brief episode of signs or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.The outward effect can vary from uncontrolled jerking movement (tonic-clonic seizure) to as subtle as a momentary loss of awareness (absence seizure).  Diseases of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures are collectively called epilepsy. Seizures can also occur in people who do not have epilepsy for various reasons including brain trauma, drug use, elevated body temperature, low blood sugar and low levels of oxygen.

The most recent survey was conducted in July 2008 in eight Asian countries, including Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Pakistan, Thailand, and the Philippines. The tool measured seven dimensions: i) market entry; ii) access to scarce resources; iii) interconnection; iv) tariff regulation; v) anti-competitive practices; and vi) universal services; vii) quality of service, for the fixed, mobile and broadband sectors.In Sri Lanka, the mobile sector receives higher scores than the fixed sector for all dimensions excepting interconnection. The broadband sector lags behind both the fixed and mobile sectors in all but one of the parameters (regulation of anti-competitive practices).

History of Sudan<====>27422<====>History of Sudan The history of Sudan  includes both the territory that is today part of the Republic of the Sudan as well as a larger region known by the term "Sudan".  The term is derived from   bilād as-sūdān "land of the black people",   and can be used more loosely of West and Central Africa in general, especially the Sahel. The modern Republic of Sudan was formed in 1956 and inherited its boundaries from Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, established in 1899.  For times predating 1899, usage of the term "Sudan" for the territory of the Republic of Sudan is somewhat anachronistic, and may also refer to the more diffuse concept of the Sudan.

Demographics of Sudan<====>27424<====>Demographics of Sudan  This article is about the demographic features of the population of Sudan, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population. In Sudan's 1993 census, the population was calculated at 30 million.  No comprehensive census has been carried out since that time due to the civil war.  Estimates of Sudan, including the population of South Sudan, ranged from 37 million (United Nations estimate) to 45 million (CIA estimate).  Since the secession of South Sudan in July 2011, estimates place the current population of Sudan at about Expression error: Unrecognised punctuation character: "{" million . 

Politics of Sudan<====>27425<====>Politics of Sudan  Officially, the politics of Sudan takes place in the framework of a presidential representative democratic consociationalist republic, where the President of Sudan is head of state, head of government and commander-in-chief of the Sudanese Armed Forces in a multi-party system.  Legislative power is vested in both the government and in the two chambers, the National Assembly (lower) and the Council of States (upper), of the bicameral National Legislature.  The judiciary is independent and obtained by the Constitutional Court.  https://www. cia. gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/su. html  However, following a deadly civil war and the ongoing genocide in Darfur, Sudan is widely recognized as an authoritarian or totalitarian state where all effective political power is obtained by President Omar al-Bashir the ruling National Congress Party (NCP). 

Economy of Sudan<====>27426<====>Economy of Sudan   Until the second half of 2002, Sudan's economy boomed on the back of increases in oil production, high oil prices, and large inflows of foreign direct investment.  GDP growth registered more than 10% per year in 2006 and 2007.  From 1997 to date, Sudan has been working with the IMF to implement macroeconomic reforms, including a managed float of the exchange rate.  Sudan began exporting crude oil in the last quarter of 1999. Agricultural production remains important, because it employs 80% of the work force and contributes a third of GDP.  The Darfur conflict, the aftermath of two decades of civil war in the south, the lack of basic infrastructure in large areas, and a reliance by much of the population on subsistence agriculture ensure much of the population will remain at or below the poverty line for years despite rapid rises in average per capita income. 

Telecommunications in Sudan<====>27427<====>Telecommunications in SudanTelecommunications in Sudan includes fixed and mobile telephones, the Internet, radio, and television. Pre-privatization era (up to 1994)Sudan had telecommunication services as early as 1897.  All of the organizations established to deliver telecommunications services were government-owned.  They were, for all practical purposes, entities with little or no operational and financial autonomy and little control over their own destiny.  Despite many development plans and efforts, the state of telecommunication sector in the country remained extremely poor through 1994.  At that time, Sudan had one of the lowest penetration rates (0. 23%) even by regional standards. 

Transport in Sudan<====>27428<====>Transport in Sudan Transport in Sudan during the early 1990s included an extensive railroad system that served the more important populated areas except in the far south, a meager road network (very little of which consisted of all-weather roads), a natural inland waterway—the Nile River and its tributaries—and a national airline that provided both international and domestic service.  Complementing this infrastructure was Port Sudan, a major deep-water port on the Red Sea, and a small but modern national merchant marine.  Additionally, a pipeline transporting petroleum products extended from the port to Khartoum. Only minimal efforts had been expended through the early 1980s to improve existing and, according to both Sudanese and foreign observers, largely inefficiently operated transport facilities. 

Sudanese Armed Forces<====>27429<====>Sudanese Armed Forces The Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) are the Armed Forces of the Republic of Sudan.

They also previously had Joint Integrated Units formed together with its rebel enemies the Sudan People's Liberation Army.  The Armed Forces operate under the authority of the People's Armed Forces Act 1986.   In 1991, the Library of Congress used the term "Sudan People's Armed Forces" to refer to the entire armed forces, but by the late 2000s (decade), the "Sudanese Armed Forces" term was most widespread. 

Foreign relations of Sudan<====>27430<====>Foreign relations of Sudan   The foreign relations of Sudan are generally in line with the Muslim Arab world, but are also based on Sudan's economic ties with the People's Republic of China and Western Europe. AfricaChad On 23 December 2005 Chad, Sudan's neighbor to the west, declared a 'state of belligerency' with Sudan and accused the country of being the "common enemy of the nation (Chad). "  This happened after the 18 December attack on Adré, which left about 100 people dead.   A statement issued by Chadian government on 23 December, accused Sudanese militias of making daily incursions into Chad, stealing cattle, killing innocent people and burning villages on the Chadian border.

Set theory<====>27553<====>Set theory  Set theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which informally are collections of objects.  Although any type of object can be collected into a set, set theory is applied most often to objects that are relevant to mathematics.  The language of set theory can be used in the definitions of nearly all mathematical objects. The modern study of set theory was initiated by Georg Cantor and Richard Dedekind in the 1870s.  After the discovery of paradoxes in naive set theory, such as Russell's paradox, numerous axiom systems were proposed in the early twentieth century, of which the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms, with or without the axiom of choice, are the best-known. 

Sabine Baring-Gould<====>27557<====>Sabine Baring-Gould  The Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould   (28 January 1834 – 2 January 1924) of Lew Trenchard in Devon, England, was an Anglican priest, hagiographer, antiquarian, novelist, folk song collector and eclectic scholar.  His bibliography consists of more than 1240 publications, though this list continues to grow.  His family home, the manor house of Lew Trenchard, near Okehampton, Devon, has been preserved as he had it rebuilt and is now a hotel.  He is remembered particularly as a writer of hymns, the best-known being "Onward, Christian Soldiers" and "Now the Day Is Over".  He also translated the carol "Gabriel's Message" from the Basque language to English. 

Salt (chemistry)<====>27558<====>Salt (chemistry)  In chemistry, a salt is an ionic compound that can be formed by the neutralization reaction of an acid and a base.   Salts are composed of related numbers of cations (positively charged ions) and anions (negative ions) so that the product is electrically neutral (without a net charge).  These component ions can be inorganic, such as chloride (Cl − ), or organic, such as acetate ( ); and can be monatomic, such as fluoride (F − ), or polyatomic, such as sulfate ( ). There are several varieties of salts.  Salts that hydrolyze  to produce hydroxide ions when dissolved in water are alkali salts; those that hydrolyze to produce hydronium ions in water are acidic salts. 

Solar deity<====>27560<====>Solar deity   A solar deity (also sun god or sun goddess) is a sky deity who represents the Sun, or an aspect of it, usually by its perceived power and strength.  Solar deities and sun worship can be found throughout most of recorded history in various forms.  The Sun is sometimes referred to by its Latin name Sol or by its Greek name Helios.  The English word sun stems from Proto-Germanic *sunnǭ.  In most romance languages the word for "sun" is masculine (e. g.  le soleil in French, el sol in Spanish, Il Sole in Italian). 

Stendhal syndrome<====>27561<====>Stendhal syndrome  Stendhal syndrome, Stendhal's syndrome, hyperkulturemia, or Florence syndrome is a psychosomatic disorder that causes rapid heartbeat, dizziness, fainting, confusion and even hallucinations when an individual is exposed to an experience of great personal significance, particularly viewing art.   It is not listed as a recognised condition in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. HistoryThe illness is named after the 19th-century French author Stendhal (pseudonym of Marie-Henri Beyle), who described his experience with the phenomenon during his 1817 visit to Florence in his book Naples and Florence: A Journey from Milan to Reggio. When he visited the Basilica of Santa Croce, where Niccolò Machiavelli, Michelangelo and Galileo Galilei are buried, he was overcome with emotion. 

Spanish proverbs<====>27562<====>Spanish proverbsSpanish proverbs are a subset of proverbs that are used in Western cultures in general; there are many that have essentially the same form and content as their counterparts in other Western languages.  Proverbs that have their origin in Spanish have migrated to and from English, French, Flemish, German and other languages. OriginsMany Spanish proverbs have a long history of cultural diffusion; there are proverbs, for example, that have their origin traced to Babylon and that have come down to us through Greece and Rome; equivalents of the Spanish proverb “En boca cerrada no entran moscas” (Silence is golden) belong to the cultural tradition of many north-African countries as far as Ethiopia; having gone through multiple languages and millennia, this proverb can be traced back to an ancient Babylonian proverb. 

Soad Hosny<====>27563<====>Soad Hosny  Soad Hosny  (    : January 26, 1943  – June 21, 2001) was an Egyptian  actress born in Cairo.  She was known as the "Cinderella of Egyptian cinema" and one of the most influential actresses in the Middle East and the Arab world.She ascended to stardom at the end of the 1950s, performing in more than 83 films between 1959 and 1991.  A majority of her films were shot in the 1960s and 1970s.  Her final screen appearance was in the 1991 film, The Shepherd and the Women, directed by her ex-husband, Ali Badrakhan. 

Summer Olympic Games<====>27566<====>Summer Olympic Games    The Summer Olympic Games ( )  or the Games of the Olympiad, first held in 1896, is an international multi-sport event that is hosted by a different city every four years.  The most recent Olympics were held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  The International Olympic Committee organizes the games and oversees the host city's preparations.  In each Olympic event, gold medals are awarded for first place, silver medals are awarded for second place, and bronze medals are awarded for third; this tradition began in 1904.  The Winter Olympic Games were created due to the success of the Summer Olympics. 

Shareware<====>27567<====>Shareware Shareware is a type of proprietary software which is initially provided free of charge to users, who are allowed and encouraged to make and share copies of the program.  Shareware is often offered as a download from a website or as a compact disc included with a magazine.  Shareware is available with most computer software.  The term shareware is used in contrast to open-source software, in which the source code is available for anyone to inspect and alter; and freeware, which is software distributed at no cost to the user but without source code being made available. 

Substance theory<====>27568<====>Substance theory Substance theory, or substance attribute theory, is an ontological theory about objecthood, positing that a substance is distinct from its properties.  A thing-in-itself is a property-bearer that must be distinguished from the properties it bears.    Substance is a key concept in ontology and metaphysics, which may be classified into monist, dualist, or pluralist varieties according to how many substances or individuals are said to populate, furnish, or exist in the world.  According to monistic views, there is only one substance.  Stoicism and Spinoza, for example, hold monistic views, that pneuma or God, respectively, is the one substance in the world.

Superfluid helium-4<====>27573<====>Superfluid helium-4Superfluid helium-4 is the superfluid form of helium-4, an isotope of the element helium.  A superfluid is a state of matter in which the matter behaves like a fluid with zero viscosity.  The substance, which looks like a normal liquid, flows without friction past any surface, which allows it to continue to circulate over obstructions and through pores in containers which hold it, subject only to its own inertia. Known as a major facet in the study of quantum hydrodynamics and macroscopic quantum phenomena, the superfluidity effect was discovered by Pyotr Kapitsa  and John F.  Allen, and Don Misener  in 1937. 

Simon Flexner<====>27574<====>Simon Flexner Simon Flexner, M. D.  (March 25, 1863 in Louisville, Kentucky – May 2, 1946) was a physician, scientist, administrator, and professor of experimental pathology at the University of Pennsylvania (1899–1903).   He served as the first director of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (1901–1935) (later developed as Rockefeller University) and a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation.   He was also a friend and adviser to John D.  Rockefeller Jr. . Among Flexner's most important achievements are studies into poliomyelitis and the development of serum treatment for meningitis.  Among his lab assistants were Hideyo Noguchi and Cornelius Rhoads, later directors of Memorial Hospital and the Sloan-Kettering Institute, respectively. 

Statistical regularity<====>27575<====>Statistical regularityStatistical regularity is a notion in statistics and probability theory that random events exhibit regularity when repeated enough times or that enough sufficiently similar random events exhibit regularity.  It is an umbrella term that covers the law of large numbers, all central limit theorems and ergodic theorems. If one throws a die once, it is difficult to predict the outcome, but if we repeat this experiment many times, we will see that the number of times each result occurs divided by the number of throws will eventually stabilize towards a specific value. Repeating a series of trials will produce similar, but not identical, results for each series: the average, the standard deviation and other distributional characteristics will be around the same for each series of trials. 

Statistical model<====>27576<====>Statistical modelA statistical model is a class of mathematical model, which embodies a set of assumptions concerning the generation of some sample data, and similar data from a larger population.  A statistical model represents, often in considerably idealized form, the data-generating process. The assumptions embodied by a statistical model describe a set of probability distributions, some of which are assumed to adequately approximate the distribution from which a particular data set is sampled.  The probability distributions inherent in statistical models are what distinguishes statistical models from other, non-statistical, mathematical models. A statistical model is usually specified by mathematical equations that relate one or more random variables and possibly other non-random variables. 

Statistical inference<====>27577<====>Statistical inference Statistical inference is the process of deducing properties of an underlying probability distribution by analysis of data.  Upton, G. , Cook, I.  (2008) Oxford Dictionary of Statistics, OUP.Inferential statistical analysis infers properties about a population: this includes testing hypotheses and deriving estimates.   The population is assumed to be larger than the observed data set; in other words, the observed data is assumed to be sampled from a larger population. Inferential statistics can be contrasted with descriptive statistics.   Descriptive statistics is solely concerned with properties of the observed data, and does not assume that the data came from a larger population. 

Survey sampling<====>27578<====>Survey samplingIn statistics, survey sampling describes the process of selecting a sample of elements from a target population to conduct a survey.  The term "survey" may refer to many different types or techniques of observation.   In survey sampling it most often involves a questionnaire used to measure the characteristics and/or attitudes of people.  Different ways of contacting members of a sample once they have been selected is the subject of survey data collection.  The purpose of sampling is to reduce the cost and/or the amount of work that it would take to survey the entire target population. 

Statistical theory<====>27579<====>Statistical theoryThe theory of statistics provides a basis for the whole range of techniques, in both study design and data analysis, that are used within applications of statistics. The theory covers approaches to statistical-decision problems and to statistical inference, and the actions and deductions that satisfy  the basic principles stated for these different approaches.  Within a given approach, statistical theory gives ways of comparing statistical procedures; it can find a best possible procedure within a given context for given statistical problems, or can provide guidance on the choice between alternative procedures.   Apart from philosophical considerations about how to make statistical inferences and decisions, much of statistical theory consists of mathematical statistics, and is closely linked to probability theory, to utility theory, and to optimization. 

Statistical unit<====>27580<====>Statistical unitA unit in a statistical analysis is one member of a set of entities being studied.   It is the material source for the mathematical abstraction of a "random variable".  Common examples of a unit would be a single person, animal, plant, manufactured item, or country that belongs to a larger collection of such entities being studied. Units are often referred to as being either experimental units, sampling units or units of observation:An "experimental unit" is typically thought of as one member of a set of objects that are initially equivalent, with each object then subjected to one of several experimental treatments. 

Statistical assembly<====>27581<====>Statistical assembly In statistics, for example in statistical quality control, a statistical assembly is a collection of parts or components which makes up a statistical unit.  Thus a statistical unit, which would be the prime item of concern, is made of discrete components like organs or machine parts.  The reliability of the statistical unit is, in part, determined by the reliability of the components in the statistical assembly, and by their interactions. Much of the observation of a statistical assembly requires special preparation of the unit, which demands that the intervention must not prejudice the observations.  A simple version of this kind of research uses the stimulus-response model. 

Stimulus–response model<====>27582<====>Stimulus–response modelThe stimulus–response model is a characterization of a statistical unit (such as a neuron) as a black box model, predicting a quantitative response to a quantitative stimulus, for example one administered by a researcher. Fields of applicationStimulus–response models are applied in international relations,    psychology,    risk assessment,    neuroscience,   neurally-inspired system design,   and many other fields. Mathematical formulationThe object of a stimulus–response model is to establish a mathematical function that describes the relation f between the stimulus x and the expected value (or other measure of location) of the response Y:  E(Y) = f(x) A common simplification assumed for such functions is linear, thus we expect to see a relationship like E(Y) = \alpha + \beta x. 

Statistical population<====>27585<====>Statistical populationIn statistics, a population is a set of similar items or events which is of interest for some question or experiment.    A statistical population can be a group of actually existing objects (e. g.  the set of all stars within the Milky Way galaxy) or a hypothetical and potentially infinite group of objects conceived as a generalization from experience (e. g.  the set of all possible hands in a game of poker).   A common aim of statistical analysis is to produce information about some chosen population.  In statistical inference, a subset of the population (a statistical sample) is chosen to represent the population in a statistical analysis. 

Sample (statistics)<====>27586<====>Sample (statistics)In statistics and quantitative research methodology, a data sample is a set of data collected and/or selected from a statistical population by a defined procedure.   The elements of a sample are known as sample points, sampling units or observations . Typically, the population is very large, making a census or a complete enumeration of all the values in the population either impractical or impossible.  The sample usually represents a subset of manageable size.  Samples are collected and statistics are calculated from the samples, so that one can make inferences or extrapolations from the sample to the population. 

Summary statistics<====>27587<====>Summary statisticsIn descriptive statistics, summary statistics are used to summarize a set of observations, in order to communicate the largest amount of information as simply as possible.  Statisticians commonly try to describe the observations ina measure of location, or central tendency, such as the arithmetic meana measure of statistical dispersion like the standard deviationa measure of the shape of the distribution like skewness or kurtosisif more than one variable is measured, a measure of statistical dependence such as a correlation coefficientA common collection of order statistics used as summary statistics are the five-number summary, sometimes extended to a seven-number summary, and the associated box plot. 

Range (statistics)<====>27588<====>Range (statistics)  In statistics, the range of a set of data is the difference between the largest and smallest values.  However, in descriptive statistics, this concept of range has a more complex meaning.  The range is the size of the smallest interval which contains all the data and provides an indication of statistical dispersion.  It is measured in the same units as the data.  Since it only depends on two of the observations, it is most useful in representing the dispersion of small data sets.  Independent identically distributed continuous random variablesFor n independent and identically distributed continuous random variables X 1 , X 2 , . 

Standard deviation<====>27590<====>Standard deviation In statistics, the standard deviation (SD, also represented by the Greek letter sigma σ or the Latin letter s) is a measure that is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values.A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values. The standard deviation of a random variable, statistical population, data set, or probability distribution is the square root of its variance. 

Statistical assumption<====>27592<====>Statistical assumptionStatistics, like all mathematical disciplines, does not infer valid conclusions from nothing.  Inferring interesting conclusions about real statistical populations almost always requires some background assumptions.  Those assumptions must be made carefully, because incorrect assumptions can generate wildly inaccurate conclusions. Here are some examples of statistical assumptions. Independence of observations from each other (this assumption is an especially common error ). Independence of observational error from potential confounding effects. Exact or approximate normality of observations (or errors). Linearity of graded responses to quantitative stimuli, e. g.  in linear regression. Classes of assumptionsThere are two approaches to statistical inference: model-based inference and design-based inference. 

Independence (probability theory)<====>27593<====>Independence (probability theory) In probability theory, two events are independent, statistically independent, or stochastically independent    if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of occurrence of the other.  Similarly, two random variables are independent if the realization of one does not affect the probability distribution of the other. The concept of independence extends to dealing with collections of more than two events or random variables, in which case the events are pairwise  independent if each pair are independent of each other, and the events are mutually independent if each event is independent of each other combination of events. 

Sherrié Austin<====>27595<====>Sherrié Austin   Sherrie Veronica Krenn (born 28 August 1970), known professionally as Sherrié Austin, is an Australian actress and singer.  Active as a singer since her teenage years, Austin initially recorded as one half of the duo Colourhaus, which also featured Phil Radford.  After leaving Colourhaus, she recorded one album in her native Australia, before moving to the United States in pursuit of a singing career. There, she recorded four studio albums, and charted several singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts.  Her highest charting single was the No.  18 "Streets of Heaven" in 2003. 

Stratified sampling<====>27596<====>Stratified sampling In statistics, stratified sampling is a method of sampling from a population. In statistical surveys, when subpopulations within an overall population vary, it is advantageous to sample each subpopulation (stratum) independently.  Stratification is the process of dividing members of the population into homogeneous subgroups before sampling.  The strata should be mutually exclusive: every element in the population must be assigned to only one stratum.  The strata should also be collectively exhaustive: no population element can be excluded.  Then simple random sampling or systematic sampling is applied within each stratum.  The objective is to improve the precision of the sample by reducing sampling error. 

Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America<====>27600<====>Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, or SFWA (  or  ) is a nonprofit 501(c)3 organization of professional science fiction and fantasy writers.  While SFWA is based in the United States, its membership is open to writers worldwide.  The organization was founded in 1965 by Damon Knight under the name Science Fiction Writers of America, Inc.  The president of SFWA as of 2015 is Cat Rambo. SFWA has about 1,900 professionally published writer members worldwide.  SFWA members vote for the Nebula Awards, one of the principal English-language science fiction awards. 

Soul Coughing<====>27606<====>Soul Coughing    Soul Coughing was an American alternative rock group, comprising vocalist/guitarist Mike Doughty, keyboardist Mark de Gli Antoni, bassist Sebastian Steinberg and drummer Yuval Gabay, Soul Coughing developed a devout fanbase and have garnered largely positive response from critics.  Steve Huey in AllMusic describes the band as "one of the most unusual cult bands of the 1990s. . . driven by frontman Mike Doughty's stream-of-consciousness poetry, Soul Coughing's sound was a willfully idiosyncratic mix of improvisational jazz grooves, oddball samples, hip-hop, electronics, and noisy experimentalism (described by Doughty as 'deep slacker jazz'). "    The inventive sampling and keyboard artistry of Mark Degli Antoni undergirded the band's distinct sound. 

Science fiction on television<====>27608<====>Science fiction on television  Science fiction first appeared in television programming in the late 1930s, during what is called the Golden Age of Science Fiction.  Special effects and other production techniques allow creators to present a living visual image of an imaginary world not limited by the constraints of reality. Science fiction television production process and methodsThe need to portray imaginary settings or characters with properties and abilities beyond the reach of current reality obliges producers to make extensive use of specialized techniques of television production. Through most of the 20th century, many of these techniques were expensive and involved a small number of dedicated craft practitioners, while the reusability of props, models, effects, or animation techniques made it easier to keep using them. 

Skeleton<====>27609<====>Skeleton   The skeleton (from Greek σκελετός, skeletós "dried up" ) is the body part that forms the supporting structure of an organism.  There are several different skeletal types: the exoskeleton, which is the stable outer shell of an organism, the endoskeleton, which forms the support structure inside the body, the hydroskeleton, and the cytoskeleton. Types of skeletonsThere are two major types of skeletons: solid and fluid.  Solid skeletons can be internal, called an endoskeleton, or external, called an exoskeleton, and may be further classified as pliant (elastic/movable) or rigid (hard/non-movable).Fluid skeletons are always internal. 

Sarah Michelle Gellar<====>27611<====>Sarah Michelle Gellar    Sarah Michelle Gellar(born April 14, 1977)  is an American actress, producer, and entrepreneur.  After being spotted by an agent at the age of four in New York City, she made her acting debut in the made-for-TV movie An Invasion of Privacy (1983).  Gellar went on to appear in numerous television series and commercials.  Her first leading role was in the 1992 miniseries Swans Crossing, for which she was nominated for two Young Artist Awards.  Her television breakthrough came in 1993, when she originated the role of Kendall Hart on the ABC daytime soap opera All My Children, winning the 1995 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series. 

Sonic screwdriver<====>27612<====>Sonic screwdriver   The sonic screwdriver is a multifunctional fictional tool  in the British science fiction television programme Doctor Who and its spin-offs, used by the Doctor.  Like the TARDIS, it has become one of the icons of the programme, and spin-off media such as The Sarah Jane Adventures and Torchwood have replicated its functions in devices such as the sonic lipstick, sonic blaster, sonic probe, and sonic modulator. The sonic screwdriver was first introduced in 1968 in the story Fury from the Deep, and used twice more (The Dominators and The War Games) during the Second Doctor's tenure. 

Slide guitar<====>27614<====>Slide guitar Slide guitar is a particular technique for playing the guitar that is often used in blues-style music.  The technique involves placing an object against the strings while playing to create glissando effects and deep vibratos that make the music emotionally expressive.  It typically involves playing the guitar in the traditional position (flat against the body) with the use of a tubular "slide" fitted on one of the guitarist's fingers.  The slide may be a metal or glass tube like the neck of a bottle.  The term "bottleneck" was historically used to describe this type of playing. 

Steel guitar<====>27615<====>Steel guitar Steel guitar is a type of guitar or the method of playing the instrument.  Developed in Hawaii in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a steel guitar is usually positioned horizontally; strings are plucked with one hand, while the other hand changes the pitch of one or more strings with the use of a bar or slide called a steel (generally made of metal, but also of glass or other materials).  The earliest use of an electrified steel guitar was first made in the early 1930s by Bob Dunn of Milton Brown and His Brownies, a western swing band from Fort Worth, Texas;  the instrument was perfected in the mid to late 1930s by Fort Worth's Leon McAluff, who played for western swing band Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys.

Middle: sunspot close-up in the visible spectrum (left) and in UV, taken by the TRACE observatory. Bottom: A large group of sunspots stretching about   across.  Sunspots are temporary phenomena on the Sun's photosphere that appear as spots darker than the surrounding areas.  They are regions of reduced surface temperature caused by concentrations of magnetic field flux that inhibit convection.  Sunspots usually appear in pairs of opposite magnetic polarity.   Their number varies according to the approximately 11-year solar cycle. 

Sicily<====>27619<====>Sicily Sicily (   ;    ,  ) is the largest island in the Mediterranean Sea.  It is an autonomous region of Italy, in Southern Italy along with surrounding minor islands, officially referred to as Regione Siciliana. Sicily is located in the central Mediterranean Sea, south of the Italian Peninsula, from which it is separated by the narrow Strait of Messina.  Its most prominent landmark is Mount Etna, the tallest active volcano in Europe,  and one of the most active in the world, currently   high.  The island has a typical Mediterranean climate. 

Stanley Milgram<====>27628<====>Stanley Milgram Stanley Milgram (August 15, 1933 – December 20, 1984) was an American social psychologist, best known for his controversial experiment on obedience conducted in the 1960s during his professorship at Yale.  Blass, T.  (2004).  The Man Who Shocked the World: The Life and Legacy of Stanley Milgram.Milgram was influenced by the events of the Holocaust, especially the trial of Adolf Eichmann, in developing the experiment. After earning a PhD in social psychology from Harvard University, he taught at Yale, Harvard, and then for most of his career as a professor at the City University of New York Graduate Center, until he died in 1984. 

Senegal River<====>27629<====>Senegal River    The Senegal River ( ,  ) is a   long river in West Africa that forms the border between Senegal and Mauritania. GeographyThe Senegal's headwaters are the Semefé (Bakoye) and Bafing rivers which  both originate in Guinea; they form a small part of the Guinean-Malian border before coming together at Bafoulabé in Mali.  From there, the Senegal river flows west and then north through Talari Gorges near Galougo and over the Gouina Falls, then flows more gently past Kayes, where it receives the Kolimbiné.  After flowing together with the Karakoro, it prolongs the former's course along the Mali-Mauritanian border for some tens of kilometers till Bakel where it flows together with the Falémé River, which also has its source in Guinea, subsequently runs along a small part of the Guinea-Mali frontier to then trace most of the Senegal-Mali border up to Bakel. 

Subset<====>27631<====>Subset  In mathematics, especially in set theory, a set A is a subset of a set B, or equivalently B is a superset of A, if A is "contained" inside B, that is, all elements of A are also elements of B.  A and B may coincide.  The relationship of one set being a subset of another is called inclusion or sometimes containment. The subset relation defines a partial order on sets. The algebra of subsets forms a Boolean algebra in which the subset relation is called inclusion. DefinitionsIf A and B are sets and every element of A is also an element of B, then:A is a subset of (or is included in) B, denoted by  A \subseteq B, or equivalentlyB is a superset of (or includes) A, denoted by  B \supseteq A. 

Stonehenge<====>27633<====>Stonehenge Stonehenge is a prehistoric monument in Wiltshire, England,   west of Amesbury.  It consists of a ring of standing stones, with each standing stone around   high,   wide and weighing around 25 tons.  The stones are set within earthworks in the middle of the most dense complex of Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments in England, including several hundred burial mounds.  Archaeologists believe it was constructed from 3000 BC to 2000 BC.  The surrounding circular earth bank and ditch, which constitute the earliest phase of the monument, have been dated to about 3100 BC. 

Sima Qian<====>27636<====>Sima QianSima Qian ( ), was a Chinese historian of the early Han dynasty (206  AD 220).  He is considered the father of Chinese historiography for his Records of the Grand Historian, a Jizhuanti-style (history presented in a series of biographies) general history of China, covering more than two thousand years from the Yellow Emperor to his time, during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, a work that had much influence for centuries afterwards on history-writing not only in China, but in Korea, Japan and Vietnam as well.   Although he worked as the Court Astrologer (Tàishǐ Lìng  ), later generations refer to him as the Grand Historian (Tàishǐ Gōng  ) for his monumental work; a work which in later generations would often only be somewhat tacitly or glancingly acknowledged as an achievement only made possible by his acceptance and endurance of punitive actions against him, including imprisonment, castration, and subjection to servility. 

Structural geology<====>27637<====>Structural geology Structural geology is the study of the three-dimensional distribution of rock units with respect to their deformational histories.  The primary goal of structural geology is to use measurements of present-day rock geometries to uncover information about the history of deformation (strain) in the rocks, and ultimately, to understand the stress field that resulted in the observed strain and geometries.  This understanding of the dynamics of the stress field can be linked to important events in the geologic past; a common goal is to understand the structural evolution of a particular area with respect to regionally widespread patterns of rock deformation (e. 

Spermatozoon<====>27638<====>Spermatozoon A spermatozoon (pronounced  , alternate spelling spermatozoön; plural spermatozoa; from   "seed" and   "living being") is a motile sperm cell, or moving form of the haploid cell that is the male gamete.  A spermatozoon joins an ovum to form a zygote.  (A zygote is a single cell, with a complete set of chromosomes, that normally develops into an embryo. ) Sperm cells contribute approximately half of the nuclear genetic information to the diploid offspring (excluding, in most cases, mitochondrial DNA).  In mammals, the sex of the offspring is determined by the sperm cell: a spermatozoon bearing a X chromosome will lead to a female (XX) offspring, while one bearing a Y chromosome will lead to a male (XY) offspring. 

Samuel Beckett<====>27640<====>Samuel Beckett   Samuel Barclay Beckett ( ; 13 April 1906 – 22 December 1989) was an Irish avant-garde novelist, playwright, theatre director, poet, and literary translator who lived in Paris for most of his adult life.  He wrote in both English and French. Beckett's work offers a bleak, tragicomic outlook on human existence, often coupled with black comedy and gallows humour, and became increasingly minimalist in his later career.  He is considered one of the last modernist writers, and one of the key figures in what Martin Esslin called the "Theatre of the Absurd".  Beckett was awarded the 1969 Nobel Prize in Literature "for his writing, which—in new forms for the novel and drama—in the destitution of modern man acquires its elevation". 

Sam Peckinpah<====>27641<====>Sam Peckinpah  David Samuel Peckinpah ( ;  February 21, 1925 – December 28, 1984) was an American film director and screenwriter who achieved prominence following the release of the Western epic The Wild Bunch (1969).  He was known for the visually innovative and explicit depiction of action and violence as well as his revisionist approach to the Western genre. Peckinpah's films generally deal with the conflict between values and ideals, the corruption and violence in human society.  He was given the nickname "Bloody Sam" owing to the violence in his films.  His characters are often loners or losers who desire to be honorable, but are forced to compromise in order to survive in a world of nihilism and brutality. 

Shanghai<====>27643<====>Shanghai    Shanghai ( ;    ;  ) is one of the four direct-controlled municipalities of China and the most populous city proper in the world, with a population of more than 24 million  .   It is a global financial centre  and transport hub, with the world's busiest container port.   Located in the Yangtze River Delta, it sits on the south edge of the estuary of the Yangtze in the middle portion of the East China coast.  The municipality borders the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to the north, south and west, and is bounded to the east by the East China Sea. 

Sinai Peninsula<====>27644<====>Sinai Peninsula  The Sinai Peninsula or simply Sinai ( ; ;    ,  ;    ;  ) is a peninsula in Egypt, the only part of the country located in Asia.  It is situated between the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Red Sea to the south, and is a land bridge between Asia and Africa.  Sinai has a land area of about   and a population of approximately 1,400,000 people.  Administratively, the Sinai Peninsula is divided into two governorates: the South Sinai Governorate and the North Sinai Governorate. 

Spy fiction<====>27646<====>Spy fiction  Spy fiction, a genre of literature involving espionage as an important context or plot device, emerged in the early twentieth century, inspired by rivalries and intrigues between the major powers, and the establishment of modern intelligence agencies.  It was given new impetus by the development of fascism and communism in the lead-up to World War II, continued to develop during the Cold War, and received a fresh impetus from the emergence of rogue states, international criminal organizations, global terrorist networks, maritime piracy and technological sabotage and espionage as potent threats to Western societies. As a genre, spy fiction is thematically related to the novel of adventure (The Prisoner of Zenda, 1894, The Scarlet Pimpernel, 1905), the thriller (such as the works of Edgar Wallace) and the politico–military thriller (The Schirmer Inheritance, 1953, The Quiet American, 1955). 

Star height problem<====>27647<====>Star height problemThe star height problem in formal language theory is the question whether all regular languages can be expressed using regular expressions of limited star height, i. e.  with a limited nesting depth of Kleene stars.  Specifically, is a nesting depth of one always sufficient? If not, is there an algorithm to determine how many are required? The problem was raised by  . Families of regular languages with unbounded star heightThe first question was answered in the negative when in 1963, Eggan gave examples of regular languages of star height n for every n.  Here, the star height h(L) of a regular language L is defined as the minimum star height among all regular expressions representing L. 

William Crookes<====>27648<====>William Crookes  Sir William Crookes   ( ; 17 June 1832 – 4 April 1919) was a British chemist and physicist who attended the Royal College of Chemistry    in London, and worked on spectroscopy.  He was a pioneer of vacuum tubes, inventing the Crookes tube which was made in 1875.  Crookes was the inventor of the Crookes radiometer,  which today is made and sold as a novelty item.  Late in life, he became interested in spiritualism, and became the president of the Society for Psychical Research. BiographyCrookes made a career of being a meteorologist and fierce lecturer for multiple studies and courses.

Events1122 – Pope Callixtus II and Holy Roman Emperor Henry V agree to the Concordat of Worms to put an end to the Investiture Controversy. 1338 – The Battle of Arnemuiden was the first naval battle of the Hundred Years' War and the first naval battle using artillery, as the English ship Christopher had three cannons and one hand gun. 1409 – Battle of Kherlen, the second significant victory over Ming dynasty China by the Mongols since 1368. 

Sonny Bono<====>27655<====>Sonny Bono   Salvatore Phillip "Sonny" Bono ( ; February 16, 1935 – January 5, 1998) was an American singer, songwriter, producer, and politician who came to fame in partnership with his second wife Cher, as the popular singing duo Sonny & Cher.  He was mayor of Palm Springs, California from 1988 to 1992, and congressman for California's 44th district from 1995 until his death in 1998. The United States Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998, which extended the term of copyright by 20 years, was named in honor of Bono when it was passed by Congress nine months after his death. 

Single market<====>27656<====>Single market  A single market is a type of trade bloc in which most trade barriers have been removed (for goods) with some common policies on product regulation, and freedom of movement of the factors of production (capital and labour) and of enterprise and services.  The goal is that the movement of capital, labour, goods, and services between the members is as easy as within them.   The physical (borders), technical (standards) and fiscal (taxes) barriers among the member states are removed to the maximum extent possible.  These barriers obstruct the freedom of movement of the four factors of production. 

Special administrative regions of China<====>27658<====>Special administrative regions of China    The special administrative regions (SAR) are one type of provincial-level administrative divisions of China directly under Central People's Government, which enjoys the highest degree of autonomy, and no or less interference by either Central Government or the Chinese Communist Party. The legal basis for the establishment of SARs, unlike the administrative divisions of Mainland China, is provided for by Article 31, rather than Article 30, of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China of 1982.  Article 31 reads: "The state may establish special administrative regions when necessary.The systems to be instituted in special administrative regions shall be prescribed by law enacted by the National People's Congress in the light of the specific conditions". 

Seattle Mariners<====>27660<====>Seattle Mariners  The Seattle Mariners are an American professional baseball team based in Seattle.  The Mariners compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) West Division.  The team joined the AL as an expansion team in 1977.  Since July  , the Mariners' home ballpark has been Safeco Field, located in the SoDo neighborhood of Seattle. The "Mariners" name originates from the prominence of marine culture in the city of Seattle.  They are nicknamed the M's, a title featured in their primary logo from 1987 to 1992.  They adopted their current team colors – Navy blue, northwest green (teal), and silver – prior to the 1993 season, after having been royal blue and gold since the team's inception. 

Source code<====>27661<====>Source code    In computing, source code is any collection of computer instructions, possibly with comments, written using a human-readable programming language, usually as plain text.  The source code of a program is specially designed to facilitate the work of computer programmers, who specify the actions to be performed by a computer mostly by writing source code.  The source code is often transformed by an assembler or compiler into binary machine code understood by the computer.  The machine code might then be stored for execution at a later time.  Alternatively, source code may be interpreted and thus immediately executed. 

Space<====>27667<====>Space   Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction.   Physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions, although modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime.  The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe.  However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework. Debates concerning the nature, essence and the mode of existence of space date back to antiquity; namely, to treatises like the Timaeus of Plato, or Socrates in his reflections on what the Greeks called khôra (i. 

Spanish cuisine<====>27669<====>Spanish cuisine  Spanish cuisine is heavily influenced by regional cuisines and the particular historical processes that shaped culture and society in those territories.  Geography and climate had great influence on cooking methods and available ingredients, and these particularities are still present in the gastronomy of the various regions that make up the country.  Spanish cuisine derives from a complex history, where invasions of the country and conquests of new territories modified traditions and made new ingredients available. History of SpainSpain before the Roman Empire Spain used to be divided in three territories for three different “clans": the Celts (north of Spain), the Iberians (center east), and the Tartessos (South). 

Santiago de Compostela<====>27670<====>Santiago de Compostela{{Infobox settlement   }}Santiago de Compostela, commonly known as Santiago ( ,  ,  ), is the capital of the autonomous community of Galicia in northwestern Spain. The city has its origin in the shrine of Saint James the Great, now the city's cathedral, as destination of the Way of St.  James, a leading Catholic pilgrimage route originated in the  .  In 1985 the city's Old Town was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. ToponymSantiago is the local Galician evolution of Vulgar Latin Sanctus Iacobus "Saint James".  According to legend, Compostela derives from the Latin Campus Stellae (i. 

Sailing<====>27672<====>Sailing {{multiple image }}Sailing employs the wind—acting on sails, wingsails or kites—to propel a craft on the surface of the water (sailing ship, sailboat, windsurfer, or kitesurfer), on ice (iceboat) or on land (land yacht) over a chosen course, which is often part of a larger plan of navigation. A course defined with respect to the true wind direction is called a point of sail. Conventional sailing craft cannot derive power from sails on a point of sail that is too close into the wind.  On a given point of sail, the sailor adjusts the alignment of each sail with respect to the apparent wind direction (as perceived on the craft) to mobilize the power of the wind. 

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol<====>27675<====>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol    Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is an Internet standard for electronic mail (email) transmission.  First defined by   in 1982, it was last updated in 2008 with Extended SMTP additions by  , which is the protocol in widespread use today.  Although electronic mail servers and other mail transfer agents use SMTP to send and receive mail messages, user-level client mail applications typically use SMTP only for sending messages to a mail server for relaying.  For retrieving messages, client applications usually use either IMAP or POP3. SMTP communication between mail servers uses TCP port 25. 

Shuttlecock<====>27676<====>Shuttlecock  A shuttlecock  (also called a bird or birdie) is a high-drag projectile used in the sport of badminton.  It has an open conical shape formed by feathers (or a synthetic alternative) embedded into a rounded cork (or rubber) base.  The shuttlecock's shape makes it extremely aerodynamically stable.  Regardless of initial orientation, it will turn to fly cork first, and remain in the cork-first orientation.  NameThe name 'shuttlecock' originates in Victorian times, when Badminton first became popular.  It is frequently shortened to shuttle.  The "shuttle" part of the name was probably derived from its back-and-forth motion during the game, resembling the shuttle of a loom, while the "cock" part of the name was probably derived from the resemblance of the feathers to those on a Rooster. 

Soldering iron<====>27679<====>Soldering ironA soldering iron is  a hand tool used in soldering.  It supplies heat to melt solder so that it can flow into the joint between two workpieces. A soldering iron is composed of a heated metal tip and an insulated handle.  Heating is often achieved electrically, by passing an electric current (supplied through an electrical cord or battery cables) through a resistive heating element.  Cordless irons can be heated by combustion of gas stored in a small tank, often using a catalytic heater rather than a flame.  Simple irons less commonly used than in the past were simply a large copper bit on a handle, heated in a flame. 

Supernova<====>27680<====>Supernova A supernova (  plural: supernovae   or supernovas, abbreviations: SN and SNe) is a transient astronomical event that occurs during the last stellar evolutionary stages of a massive star's life, whose dramatic and catastrophic destruction is marked by one final titanic explosion.  This causes the sudden appearance of a "new" bright star, before slowly fading from sight over several weeks or months.  Supernovae are more energetic than novae.  In Latin, nova means "new", referring astronomically to what appears to be a temporary new bright star.  Adding the prefix "super-" distinguishes supernovae from ordinary novae, which are far less luminous. 

Sergei Prokofiev<====>27681<====>Sergei Prokofiev    Sergei Sergeyevich Prokofiev ( ;; ; alternative transliterations of his name include Sergey or Serge, and Prokofief, Prokofieff, or Prokofyev. 27 April 1891 – 5 March 1953) was a Soviet composer, pianist and conductor.  As the creator of acknowledged masterpieces across numerous musical genres, he is regarded as one of the major composers of the 20th century.  His works include such widely heard works as the March from The Love for Three Oranges, the suite Lieutenant Kijé, the ballet Romeo and Juliet – from which "Dance of the Knights" is taken – and Peter and the Wolf. 

Satellite<====>27683<====>Satellite   In the context of spaceflight, a satellite is an artificial object which has been intentionally placed into orbit.  Such objects are sometimes called artificial satellites to distinguish them from natural satellites such as Earth's Moon. In 1957 the Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1.  Since then, about 6,600 satellites from more than 40 countries have been launched.  According to a 2013 estimate, 3,600 remained in orbit.Of those, about 1,000 were operational;    while the rest have lived out their useful lives and become space debris. 

Steampunk<====>27684<====>Steampunk  Steampunk is a subgenre of science fiction or science fantasy that incorporates technology and aesthetic designs inspired by 19th-century industrial steam-powered machinery. Although its literary origins are sometimes associated with the cyberpunk genre,    steampunk works are often set in an alternative history of the 19th century's British Victorian era or American "Wild West", in a future during which steam power has maintained mainstream usage, or in a fantasy world that similarly employs steam power.  However, steampunk and Neo-Victorian are different in that the Neo-Victorian movement does not extrapolate on technology and embraces the positive aspects of the Victorian era's culture and philosophy. 

Spreadsheet<====>27686<====>SpreadsheetA spreadsheet is an interactive computer application for organization, analysis and storage of data in tabular form.Spreadsheets are developed as computerized simulations of paper accounting worksheets.   The program operates on data entered in cells of a table.  Each cell may contain either numeric or text data, or the results of formulas that automatically calculate and display a value based on the contents of other cells.  A spreadsheet may also refer to one such electronic document.    Spreadsheet users can adjust any stored value and observe the effects on calculated values. 

St. Louis<====>27687<====>St.  Louis   St.  Louis ( )    is an independent city [1]    and major U. S.  port in the state of Missouri, built along the western bank of the Mississippi River, which marks Missouri's border with Illinois.  The city had an estimated 2016 population of 311,404,    and is the cultural and economic center of the Greater St.  Louis area (home to 2,916,447 people ), making it the largest metropolitan area in Missouri and the 19th-largest in the United States. Prior to European settlement, the area was a major regional center of Native American Mississippian culture. 

Social security<====>27691<====>Social security   Social security is "any government system that provides monetary assistance to people with an inadequate or no income. "   Social security is  enshrined in Article 22 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states: Everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social security and is entitled to realization, through national effort and international co-operation and in accordance with the organization and resources of each State, of the economic, social and cultural rights indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality.  In simple terms, the signatories agree that society in which a person lives should help them to develop and to make the most of all the advantages (culture, work, social welfare) which are offered to them in the country. 

Steam engine<====>27692<====>Steam engine    A steam engine is a heat engine that performs mechanical work using steam as its working fluid. Steam engines are external combustion engines,    where the working fluid is separated from the combustion products.  Non-combustion heat sources such as solar power, nuclear power or geothermal energy may be used.  The ideal thermodynamic cycle used to analyze this process is called the Rankine cycle.  In the cycle, water is heated and changes into steam in a boiler operating at a high pressure.  When expanded using pistons or turbines mechanical work is done. 

Satan<====>27694<====>Satan  	Satan  is a malevolent figure in the Abrahamic religions who seeks to seduce humans into falsehood and sin.    In Christianity and Islam, he is usually seen as a fallen angel, or a jinn, who used to possess great piety and beauty, but rebelled against God out of hubris.  God allows Satan temporary power over the fallen world and grants him a host of demons. A figure known as "the satan" first appears in the Tanakh as a heavenly prosecutor, a member of the sons of God subordinate to Yahweh, who prosecutes the nation of Judah in the heavenly court and tests the loyalty of Yahweh's followers by forcing them to suffer. 

Structured programming<====>27695<====>Structured programming  Structured programming is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by making extensive use of subroutines, block structures, for and while loops—in contrast to using simple tests and jumps such as the go to statement, which could lead to "spaghetti code" that is difficult to follow and maintain. It emerged in the late 1950s with the appearance of the ALGOL 58 and ALGOL 60 programming languages,  with the latter including support for block structures.  Contributing factors to its popularity and widespread acceptance, at first in academia and later among practitioners, include the discovery of what is now known as the structured program theorem in 1966,  and the publication of the influential "Go To Statement Considered Harmful" open letter in 1968 by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. 

Semiconductor device fabrication<====>27696<====>Semiconductor device fabrication  Semiconductor device fabrication is the process used to create the integrated circuits that are present in everyday electrical and electronic devices.  It is a multiple-step sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps during which electronic circuits are gradually created on a wafer made of pure semiconducting material.  Silicon is almost always used, but various compound semiconductors are used for specialized applications. The entire manufacturing process, from start to packaged chips ready for shipment, takes six to eight weeks and is performed in highly specialized facilities referred to as fabs.   In more advanced semiconductor devices such as modern nodes say as of 2017 regarding 14/10/7 nm device fabrication can take up to 15 weeks with 11–13 weeks being the industry average. 

Sanskrit<====>27698<====>SanskritSanskrit ( ; IPA:   ) is the primary liturgical language of Hinduism; a philosophical language of Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism, Īśvarism and Jainism; and a literary language and lingua franca for the educated of ancient and medieval India and Nepal.   As a result of transmission of Hindu and Buddhist culture to Southeast Asia and parts of Central Asia, it was also a language of high culture in some of these regions during the early-medieval era.   , Quote: "Sanskrit was another important lingua franca in the ancient world that was widely used in South Asia and in the context of Hindu and Buddhist religions in neighboring areas as well. 

Sign language<====>27699<====>Sign language Sign language (also known as  signed language) is a language that uses manual communication to convey meaning.  This can include simultaneously employing hand gestures, movement, orientation of the fingers, arms or body, and facial expressions to convey a speaker's ideas.   Sign languages often share significant similarities with their respective spoken language (such as ASL and American English).  Grammar and sentence structure, however, may vary to encourage efficiency and fluidity in speaking.  Stokoe, William C. ; Dorothy C.  Casterline; Carl G.  Croneberg.  1965.

String (computer science)<====>27701<====>String (computer science)  In computer programming, a string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable.  The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation).  A string is generally understood as a data type and is often implemented as an array data structure of bytes (or words) that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, using some character encoding.  A string may also denote more general arrays or other sequence (or list) data types and structures. 

Satanism<====>27706<====>Satanism  Satanism is a group of ideological and philosophical beliefs based on  Satan.Contemporary religious practice of Satanism began with the founding of the Church of Satan in 1966, although a few historical precedents exist.   Prior to the public practice, Satanism existed primarily as an accusation by various Christian groups toward perceived ideological opponents, rather than a self-identity.  Satanism, and the concept of Satan, has also been used by artists and entertainers for symbolic expression. Accusations that various groups have been practicing Satanism have been made throughout much of Christian history. 

Socialist law<====>27707<====>Socialist law Socialist law or Soviet law denotes a general type of legal system which has been used in communist and formerly communist states.  It is based on the civil law system, with major modifications and additions from Marxist-Leninist ideology.  There is controversy as to whether socialist law ever constituted a separate legal system or not.   If so, prior to the end of the Cold War, socialist law would be ranked among the major legal systems of the world. While civil law systems have traditionally put great pains in defining the notion of private property, how it may be acquired, transferred, or lost, socialist law systems provide for most property to be owned by the state or by agricultural co-operatives, and having special courts and laws for state enterprises. 

Semiconductor<====>27709<====>Semiconductor  A semiconductor material has an electrical conductivity value falling between that of a conductor – such as copper, gold etc.  – and an insulator, such as glass.  Their resistance decreases as their temperature increases, which is behavior opposite to that of a metal.  Their conducting properties may be altered in useful ways by the deliberate, controlled introduction of impurities ("doping") into the crystal structure.  Where two differently-doped regions exist in the same crystal, a semiconductor junction is created.  The behavior of charge carriers which include electrons, ions and electron holes at these junctions is the basis of diodes, transistors and all modern electronics. 

Starch<====>27711<====>Starch   Starch or amylum is a polymeric carbohydrate consisting of a large number of glucose units joined by glycosidic bonds.  This polysaccharide is produced by most green plants as energy storage.  It is the most common carbohydrate in human diets and is contained in large amounts in staple foods like potatoes, wheat, maize (corn), rice, and cassava. Pure starch is a white, tasteless and odorless powder that is insoluble in cold water or alcohol.  It consists of two types of molecules: the linear and helical amylose and the branched amylopectin.  Depending on the plant, starch generally contains 20 to 25% amylose and 75 to 80% amylopectin by weight. 

Sugar<====>27712<====>Sugar   Sugar is the generic name for sweet-tasting, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food.  There are various types of sugar derived from different sources.  Simple sugars are called monosaccharides and include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, and galactose.  The "table sugar" or "granulated sugar" most customarily used as food is sucrose, a disaccharide of glucose and fructose.  Sugar is used in prepared foods (e. g. , cookies and cakes) and it is added to some foods and beverages (e. g. , coffee and tea).  In the body, sucrose is hydrolysed into the simple sugars fructose and glucose. 

Saint Louis<====>27715<====>Saint Louis Saint Louis, Saint-Louis or St.  Louis may refer to a number of things, the great majority named after Saint Louis IX (1214–1270), a King of France and Catholic saint, and including the American city of St.  Louis.  PlacesUnited StatesBay St.  Louis, Mississippi, city in Hancock CountyOld Saint Louis, Indiana, unincorporated communitySt.  Louis, Missouri, independent citySt.  Louis County, Missouri, bordering the city of St.  LouisLake St.  Louis, Missouri, planned community in St.  Charles CountySt.  Louis, Michigan, city in Gratiot CountySt.  Louis County, MinnesotaSt.  Louis Park, Minnesota, city in Hennepin CountySaint Louis River, river in Minnesota and WisconsinSt. 

Salma Hayek<====>27717<====>Salma Hayek    Salma Hayek Pinault (  Hayek Jiménez;  born September 2, 1966),   is a Mexican and American  film actress, producer, and former model.  She began her career in Mexico starring in the telenovela Teresa and starred in the film El Callejón de los Milagros (Miracle Alley) for which she was nominated for an Ariel Award.  In 1991 Hayek moved to Hollywood and came to prominence with roles in films such as Desperado (1995),  From Dusk Till Dawn (1996), Dogma (1999), and Wild Wild West (1999). Her breakthrough role was in the 2002 film Frida as Mexican painter Frida Kahlo for which she was nominated in the category of Best Actress for an Academy Award, BAFTA Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, and Golden Globe Award. 

Super Bowl<====>27718<====>Super Bowl    The Super Bowl is the annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL).   The game is the culmination to a regular season that begins in the late summer of the previous calendar year.  Normally, Roman numerals are used to identify each game, rather than the year in which it is held.  For example, Super Bowl I was played on January 15, 1967, following the 1966 regular season.  The sole exception to this naming convention tradition occurred with Super Bowl 50, which was played on February 7, 2016, following the 2015 regular season, and the following year, the nomenclature returned to Roman numerals for Super Bowl LI, following the 2016 regular season. 

Surface area<====>27725<====>Surface area The surface area of a solid object is a measure of the total area that the surface of the object occupies.  The mathematical definition of surface area in the presence of curved surfaces is considerably more involved than the definition of arc length of one-dimensional curves, or of the surface area for polyhedra (i. e. , objects with flat polygonal faces), for which the surface area is the sum of the areas of its faces.  Smooth surfaces, such as a sphere, are assigned surface area using their representation as parametric surfaces.  This definition of surface area is based on methods of infinitesimal calculus and involves partial derivatives and double integration. 

Serbo-Croatian<====>27730<====>Serbo-Croatian    Serbo-Croatian  , also called Serbo-Croat  ,    Serbo-Croat-Bosnian (SCB),  Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian (BCS),  or Bosnian-Croatian-Montenegrin-Serbian (BCMS),  is a South Slavic language and the primary language of Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro.  It is a pluricentric language with four  mutually intelligible standard varieties. South Slavic dialects historically formed a continuum.  The turbulent history of the area, particularly due to expansion of the Ottoman Empire, resulted in a patchwork of dialectal and religious differences.  Due to population migrations, Shtokavian became the most widespread in the western Balkans, intruding westwards into the area previously occupied by Chakavian and Kajkavian (which further blend into Slovenian in the northwest). 

Saint Kitts<====>27737<====>Saint Kitts   Saint Kitts, also known more formally as Saint Christopher Island, is an island in the West Indies.  The west side of the island borders the Caribbean Sea, and the eastern coast faces the Atlantic Ocean.  Saint Kitts and the neighbouring island of Nevis constitute one country: the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis.  Saint Kitts and Nevis are separated by a shallow   channel known as "The Narrows". Saint Kitts became home to the first Caribbean British and French colonies in the mid-1620s.   Along with the island nation of Nevis, Saint Kitts was a member of the British West Indies until gaining independence on September 19, 1983. 

Shogi<====>27739<====>Shogi    ( ,   or  ), also known as Japanese chess or the Game of Generals, is a two-player strategy board game in the same family as chess, chaturanga, makruk, shatranj, janggi and xiangqi, and is the most popular of a family of chess variants native to Japan.  Shōgi means general's (shō  ) board game (gi  ). The earliest predecessor of the game, chaturanga, originated in India in the 6th century.  Shogi in its present form was played as early as the 16th century, while a direct ancestor without the drop rule was recorded from 1210 in a historical document Nichūreki, which is an edited copy of Shōchūreki and Kaichūreki from the late Heian period (c. 

Solar energy<====>27743<====>Solar energySolar energy is radiant light and heat from the Sun that is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as solar heating, photovoltaics, solar thermal energy, solar architecture, molten salt power plants and artificial photosynthesis.   It is an important source of renewable energy and its technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy or convert it into solar power.  Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems, concentrated solar power and solar water heating to harness the energy. 

Standard conditions for temperature and pressure<====>27745<====>Standard conditions for temperature and pressure Standard conditions for temperature and pressure are standard sets of conditions for experimental measurements to be established to allow comparisons to be made between different sets of data.  The most used standards are those of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), although these are not universally accepted standards.  Other organizations have established a variety of alternative definitions for their standard reference conditions. In chemistry, IUPAC has changed the definition of standard temperature and pressure (STP) in 1982:    Until 1982, STP was defined as a temperature of 273. 

Script kiddie<====>27750<====>Script kiddie  In programming and hacking culture, a script kiddie or skiddie  is an unskilled individual who uses scripts or programs developed by others to attack computer systems and networks and deface websites.  It is generally assumed that most script kiddies are juveniles who lack the ability to write sophisticated programs or exploits on their own and that their objective is to try to impress their friends or gain credit in computer-enthusiast communities.However, the term does not relate to the actual age of the participant.  The term is generally considered to be pejorative. 

Scalable Vector Graphics<====>27751<====>Scalable Vector Graphics   Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation.  The SVG specification is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) since 1999. SVG images and their behaviors are defined in XML text files.  This means that they can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed.  As XML files, SVG images can be created and edited with any text editor, as well as with drawing software. All major modern web browsers—including Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Opera, Safari, and Microsoft Edge—have SVG rendering support. 

Spectroscopy<====>27752<====>SpectroscopySpectroscopy   is the study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation.    Historically, spectroscopy originated through the study of visible light dispersed according to its wavelength, by a prism.  Later the concept was expanded greatly to include any interaction with radiative energy as a function of its wavelength or frequency.  Spectroscopic data are often represented by an emission spectrum, a plot of the response of interest as a function of wavelength or frequency. Introduction Spectroscopy and spectrography are terms used to refer to the measurement of radiation intensity as a function of wavelength and are often used to describe experimental spectroscopic methods.

Samaritanism<====>27754<====>SamaritanismSamaritan religion is the national religion Shulamit Sela, The Head of the Rabbanite, Karaite and Samaritan Jews: On the History of a Title, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol.  57, No.  2 (1994), pp.  255–267  of the Samaritans (Samaritan Hebrew: ࠔࠠࠌࠝࠓࠩࠉࠌ shamerim, "Guardians/Watchers [of the Torah]”; David Noel Freedman, The Anchor Bible Dictionary, 5:941 (New York: Doubleday, 1996, c1992).   Hebrew: שומרונים shomronim, “[Inhabitants] of Guard/Watch [Mountain]”).  David Noel Freedman, The Anchor Bible Dictionary, 5:941 (New York: Doubleday, 1996, c1992). The Samaritans follow the Torah, or more accurately, the Samaritan Torah, which the Samaritans believe to be the original unchanged Torah,as opposed to the better known Torah used by Jews. 

Statute of Anne<====>27760<====>Statute of AnneThe Statute of Anne, also known as the Copyright Act 1710 (cited either as 8 Ann.  c.  21 or as 8 Ann.  c.  19),  is an act of the Parliament of Great Britain passed in 1710, which was the first statute to provide for copyright regulated by the government and courts, rather than by private parties. Prior to the statute's enactment in 1710, copying restrictions were authorized by the Licensing of the Press Act 1662.  These restrictions were enforced by the Stationers' Company, a guild of printers given the exclusive power to print—and the responsibility to censor—literary works. 

School choice<====>27761<====>School choice School choice is a term for K–12 public education options in the United States, describing a wide array of programs offering students and their families alternatives to publicly provided schools, to which students are generally assigned by the location of their family residence.  In the United States, the most common—both by number of programs and by number of participating students—school choice programs are scholarship tax credit programs, which allow individuals or corporations to receive tax credits toward their state taxes in exchange for donations made to non-profit organizations that grant private school scholarships.   In other cases, a similar subsidy may be provided by the state through a school voucher program. 

Star Frontiers<====>27762<====>Star Frontiers  Star Frontiers is a science fiction role-playing game produced by TSR beginning in 1982.The game offered a space opera action-adventure setting. SettingStar Frontiers takes place near the center of a spiral galaxy (the setting does not specify whether the galaxy is our own Milky Way).   A previously undiscovered quirk of the laws of physics allows starships to jump to "The Void", a hyperspatial realm that greatly shortens the travel times between inhabited worlds, once they reach 1% of the speed of light (3,000 km/s). The basic game setting was an area known as "The Frontier Sector" where four sentient races (Dralasite, Humans, Vrusk, and Yazirian) had met and formed the United Planetary Federation (UPF). 

Structuralism<====>27763<====>Structuralism  In sociology, anthropology and linguistics, structuralism is the methodology that implies elements of human culture must be understood by way of their relationship to a larger, overarching system or structure.  It works to uncover the structures that underlie all the things that humans do, think, perceive, and feel.  Alternatively, as summarized by philosopher Simon Blackburn, structuralism is "the belief that phenomena of human life are not intelligible except through their interrelations.  These relations constitute a structure, and behind local variations in the surface phenomena there are constant laws of abstract culture".  Blackburn, Simon (2008). 

Systems engineering<====>27764<====>Systems engineeringSystems engineering is an interdisciplinary field of engineering and engineering management that focuses on how to design and manage complex systems over their life cycles.  At its core, systems engineering utilizes systems thinking principles to organize this body of knowledge.  Issues such as requirements engineering,  , logistics, coordination of different teams, testing and evaluation, maintainability and many other disciplines necessary for successful system development, design, implementation, and ultimate decommission become more difficult when dealing with large or complex projects.  Systems engineering deals with work-processes, optimization methods, and risk management tools in such projects.  It overlaps technical and human-centered disciplines such as industrial engineering, mechanical engineering, manufacturing engineering, control engineering, software engineering, electrical engineering, cybernetics, organizational studies and project management. 

September 4<====>27765<====>September 4Events476 – Romulus Augustulus, last emperor of the Western Roman Empire, is deposed when Odoacer proclaims himself "King of Italy", thus ending the Western Roman Empire. 626 – Li Shimin, posthumously known as Emperor Taizong of Tang, assumes the throne over the Tang dynasty of China. 929 – Battle of Lenzen: Slavic forces (the Redarii and the Obotrites) are defeated by a Saxon army near the fortified stronghold of Lenzen in Brandenburg. 1260 – The Sienese Ghibellines, supported by the forces of Manfred, King of Sicily, defeat the Florentine Guelphs at Montaperti. 1282 - Peter III of Aragon becomes the King of Sicily. 

Sam & Max<====>27766<====>Sam & Max  Sam & Max is a media franchise focusing on the fictional characters of Sam and Max, the Freelance Police.  The characters, who occupy a universe that parodies American popular culture, were created by Steve Purcell in his youth, and later debuted in a 1987 comic book series.  The characters have since been the subject of a graphic adventure video game developed by LucasArts, a television series produced for Fox in cooperation with Nelvana Limited, and a series of episodic adventure games developed by Telltale Games.  In addition, a variety of machinima and a webcomic have been produced for the series. 

Standard-definition television<====>27767<====>Standard-definition television Standard-definition television (SDTV or SD) is a television system which  uses a resolution that's not considered to be either high-definition television (720p, 1080i, 1080p, 1440p, 4K UHDTV, and 8K UHD) or enhanced-definition television (EDTV 480p).  The two common SDTV signal types are 576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution, derived from the European-developed PAL and SECAM systems; and 480i based on the American National Television System Committee NTSC system.  SDTV and high definition television (HDTV) are the two categories of display formats for digital television (DTV) transmissions, which are becoming the standard. In North America, digital SDTV is broadcast in the same 4:3 aspect ratio as NTSC signals with widescreen content being center cut. 

Sandstone<====>27772<====>Sandstone   Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized (0. 0625 to 2 mm) mineral particles or rock fragments. Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth's surface, as seen in Bowen's reaction series.  Like uncemented sand, sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals, but the most common colors are tan, brown, yellow, red, grey, pink, white, and black.  Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features, certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions. 

Sophia of Hanover<====>27773<====>Sophia of Hanover   Sophia of Hanover (born Sophia of the Palatinate; 14 October 1630 – 8 June 1714 ) was the Electress of Hanover from 1692 to 1698.  As a granddaughter of James VI and I, she became heir presumptive to the crowns of the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Ireland under the Act of Settlement 1701.  After the Acts of Union 1707, she became heir presumptive to the unified throne of the Kingdom of Great Britain.  She died less than two months before she would have become queen succeeding her first cousin once removed, Queen Anne, and her claim to the throne passed on to her eldest son, George Louis, Elector of Hanover, who ascended as George I on 1 August 1714 (Old Style). 

Scanning tunneling microscope<====>27774<====>Scanning tunneling microscope  A scanning tunneling microscope (STM) is an instrument for imaging surfaces at the atomic level.  Its development in 1981 earned its inventors, Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer (at IBM Zürich), the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986. For a STM, good resolution is considered to be 0. 1 nm lateral resolution and 0. 01 nm (10 pm) depth resolution.With this resolution, individual atoms within materials are routinely imaged and manipulated.  The STM can be used not only in ultra-high vacuum but also in air, water, and various other liquid or gas ambients, and at temperatures ranging from near zero kelvin to over 1000 °C. 

Svenska Akademiens ordbok<====>27778<====>Svenska Akademiens ordbok  Svenska Akademiens ordbok ( ), abbreviated SAOB, is a dictionary published by the Swedish Academy, with the official title Ordbok över svenska språket utgiven av Svenska Akademien.  This dictionary is the Swedish counterpart of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) or the Deutsches Wörterbuch (DWB).  Work on the dictionary started in 1787 and the first volume was published in 1898 and as of 2017, when the latest volume appeared, work has progressed to the word VRET.  The dictionary has approximately 450,000 main entries, and is expected to be complete around 2017.  The searchable web version has been available since 1997. 

Shirehorses<====>27781<====>ShirehorsesThe Shirehorses are a spoof band comprising two BBC Radio DJs from Manchester, Mark Radcliffe and Marc Riley, known collectively as Mark and Lard. As part of their BBC Radio 1 shows, the pair produced pastiches of chart songs, such as "You're Gormless", a parody of Babybird's "You're Gorgeous", "Lardy Boy", a parody of Placebo's "Nancy Boy", and "Why Is It Always Dairylea", spoofing Travis's "Why Does It Always Rain on Me?", using the band names 'Baby Bloke', 'Gazebo' and 'Dave Lee Travisty' respectively.  When they rewrote The Seahorses' "Love Is the Law" as "(Now) I Know (Where I'm Going) Our Kid", they chose the stage-name Shirehorses, which they then retained for future recordings and performances. 

Stem cell<====>27783<====>Stem cell   Stem cells are undifferentiated biological cells that can differentiate into specialized cells and can divide (through mitosis) to produce more stem cells.  They are found in multicellular organisms.  In mammals, there are two broad types of stem cells: embryonic stem cells, which are isolated from the inner cell mass of blastocysts, and adult stem cells, which are found in various tissues.  In adult organisms, stem cells and progenitor cells act as a repair system for the body, replenishing adult tissues.  In a developing embryo, stem cells can differentiate into all the specialized cells—ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm (see induced pluripotent stem cells)—but also maintain the normal turnover of regenerative organs, such as blood, skin, or intestinal tissues. 

Sappho<====>27784<====>Sappho  Sappho ( ; Aeolic Greek  , Psappho  ; c.  630 – c.  570 BC) was an archaic Greek poet from the island of Lesbos.   Sappho is known for her lyric poetry, written to be sung and accompanied by a lyre.   Most of Sappho's poetry is now lost, and what is extant has survived only in fragmentary form, except for one complete poem – the "Ode to Aphrodite".  As well as lyric poetry, ancient commentators claimed that Sappho wrote elegiac and iambic poetry.  Three epigrams attributed to Sappho are extant, but these are actually Hellenistic imitations of Sappho's style. 

Simon bar Kokhba<====>27786<====>Simon bar Kokhba  Simon bar Kokhba ( ; died 135 CE), born Simon ben Kosevah, was the leader of what is known as the Bar Kokhba revolt against the Roman Empire in 132 CE, establishing an independent Jewish state which he ruled for three years as Nasi ("Prince").  His state was conquered by the Romans in 135 following a two and half-year war.  NameDocuments discovered in the 20th century in the Cave of Letters give his original name, with variations: Simeon bar Kosevah ( ), Bar Koseva ( ) or Ben Koseva (  ).It is probable that his original name was Bar Koseva. 

Schizophrenia<====>27790<====>Schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by abnormal social behavior and failure to understand reality.Common symptoms include false beliefs, unclear or confused thinking, hearing voices that others do not, reduced social engagement and emotional expression, and a lack of motivation.    People with schizophrenia often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety, depressive, or substance-use disorders.Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and last a long time. The causes of schizophrenia include environmental and genetic factors. 

Sophie Germain<====>27791<====>Sophie Germain   Marie-Sophie Germain ( ; 1 April 1776 – 27 June 1831) was a French mathematician, physicist, and philosopher.  Despite initial opposition from her parents and difficulties presented by society, she gained education from books in her father's library including ones by Leonhard Euler and from correspondence with famous mathematicians such as Lagrange, Legendre, and Gauss.  One of the pioneers of elasticity theory, she won the grand prize from the Paris Academy of Sciences for her essay on the subject.  Her work on Fermat's Last Theorem provided a foundation for mathematicians exploring the subject for hundreds of years after. 

Small arms<====>27794<====>Small arms In international arms control, small arms are man-portable firearms that shoot kinetic projectiles, including handguns (revolvers and pistols) and individual-operated long guns such as rifles and carbines, shotguns, submachine guns, personal defense weapons, and light machine guns.   Together with light weapons, which either are team-operated (e. g.  heavy machine guns, portable anti-aircraft guns) or shoot explosive warheads (hand-held or underslung grenade launchers, recoilless rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, shoulder-launched missiles, portable anti-tank guns, anti-aircraft and anti-tank missile systems, mortars of caliber less than 100 mm), they comprise the Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) protocol.  According to the United Nations: "Since weapons in this class are capable of being carried, if a small arm, by one person or, if a light arm, by two or more people, a pack animal or a light vehicle, they allow for mobile operations where heavy mechanized and air forces are not available or are restricted in their capabilities owing to difficult mountain, jungle or urban terrain. 

Succubus<====>27796<====>Succubus A succubus is a Lilin-demon in female form, or supernatural entity in folklore (traced back to medieval legend) that appears in dreams and takes the form of a woman in order to seduce men, usually through sexual activity.  The male counterpart is the incubus.  Religious traditions hold that repeated sexual activity with a succubus may result in the deterioration of health or mental state, or even in death. In modern representations, a succubus may or may not appear in dreams and is often depicted as a highly attractive seductress or enchantress; whereas, in the past, succubi were generally depicted as frightening and demonic. 

Suzanne Vega<====>27797<====>Suzanne Vega  Suzanne Nadine Vega (born July 11, 1959) is an American singer-songwriter, musician and record producer, best known for her eclectic folk-inspired music.   Vega's music career spans more than 30 years.  She came to prominence in the mid 1980s, releasing four singles that entered the Top 40 charts in the UK during the 1980s and 1990s, including "Marlene on the Wall", "Left of Centre", "Luka" and "No Cheap Thrill".  "Tom's Diner" which was originally released as an a cappella recording on Vega's second album, Solitude Standing, was remixed in 1990 as a dance track by English electronic duo DNA with Vega as featured artist, and it became a Top 10 hit in over five countries. 

Semigroup<====>27799<====>SemigroupIn mathematics, a semigroup is an algebraic structure consisting of a set together with an associative binary operation. The binary operation of a semigroup is most often denoted multiplicatively: x·y, or simply xy, denotes the result of applying the semigroup operation to the ordered pair  .  Associativity is formally expressed as that   for all x, y and z in the semigroup. The name "semigroup" originates in the fact that a semigroup generalizes a group by preserving only associativity and closure under the binary operation from the axioms defining a group.  The closure axiom is implied by the definition of a binary operation on a set. 

Super Mario Kart<====>27801<====>Super Mario Kart  Super Mario Kart  is a 1992 kart racing video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game console.  The first game of the Mario Kart series, it was released in Japan and North America in 1992, and in Europe the following year.Selling nine million copies worldwide, the game went on to become the third best selling SNES game of all time.Super Mario Kart was re-released on the Wii's Virtual Console in 2009,and on the Wii U's Virtual Console in 2013. 

Seymour Papert<====>27802<====>Seymour Papert Seymour Aubrey Papert ( ; February 29, 1928 – July 31, 2016) was a South African-born American mathematician, computer scientist, and educator, who spent most of his career teaching and researching at MIT.    He was one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence, and of the constructionist movement in education.He was co-inventor, with Wally Feurzeig and Cynthia Solomon, of the Logo programming language.   Early years and educationPapert attended the University of the Witwatersrand, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy in 1949 followed by a PhD in mathematics  in 1952. 

Search engine (computing)<====>27804<====>Search engine (computing) A search engine is an information retrieval system designed to help find information stored on a computer system.  The search results are usually presented in a list and are commonly called hits.  Search engines help to minimize the time required to find information and the amount of information which must be consulted, akin to other techniques for managing information overload.   The most public, visible form of a search engine is a Web search engine which searches for information on the World Wide Web. How search engines workSearch engines provide an interface to a group of items that enables users to specify criteria about an item of interest and have the engine find the matching items. 

Spaced repetition<====>27805<====>Spaced repetitionSpaced repetition is a learning technique that incorporates increasing intervals of time between subsequent review of previously learned material in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect.  Alternative names include spaced rehearsal, expanding rehearsal, graduated intervals, repetition spacing, repetition scheduling, spaced retrieval and expanded retrieval.  Although the principle is useful in many contexts, spaced repetition is commonly applied in contexts in which a learner must acquire a large number of items and retain them indefinitely in memory.  It is, therefore, well suited for the problem of vocabulary acquisition in the course of second language learning, due to the size of the target language's inventory of open-class words. 

SuperMemo<====>27806<====>SuperMemo SuperMemo (from "Super Memory") is a learning method and software package developed by SuperMemo World and SuperMemo R&D with Piotr Woźniak in Poland from 1985 to the present.It is based on research into long-term memory, and is a practical application of the spaced repetition learning method that has been proposed for efficient instruction by a number of psychologists as early as in the 1930s.   According to the developers of SuperMemo and some other proponents of spaced repetition learning, the process can optimize long-term knowledge acquisition.The method is available as a computer program for Windows, Windows CE, Windows Mobile, (Pocket PC), iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, (iTunes), Palm OS (PalmPilot), etc. 

Samuel Pepys<====>27808<====>Samuel Pepys  Samuel Pepys   (   ;  23 February 1633 – 26 May 1703) was an administrator of the navy of England and Member of Parliament who is most famous for the diary that he kept for a decade while still a relatively young man.  Pepys had no maritime experience, but he rose to be the Chief Secretary to the Admiralty under both King Charles II and King James II through patronage, hard work, and his talent for administration.  His influence and reforms at the Admiralty were important in the early professionalisation of the Royal Navy. 

Chemical synapse<====>27809<====>Chemical synapse  Chemical synapses are biological junctions through which neurons' signals can be exchanged to each other and to non-neuronal cells such as those in muscles or glands.  Chemical synapses allow neurons to form circuits within the central nervous system.  They are crucial to the biological computations that underlie perception and thought.  They allow the nervous system to connect to and control other systems of the body. At a chemical synapse, one neuron releases neurotransmitter molecules into a small space (the synaptic cleft) that is adjacent to another neuron.  The neurotransmitters are kept within small sacs called synaptic vesicles, and are released into the synaptic cleft by exocytosis. 

Sleep and learning<====>27811<====>Sleep and learningMultiple hypotheses explain the possible connections between sleep and learning in humans.  Research indicates that sleep does more than allow the brain to rest.  It may also aid the consolidation of long-term memories. REM sleep and slow-wave sleep play different roles in memory consolidation.  REM is associated with the consolidation of nondeclarative (implicit) memories.  An example of a nondeclarative memory would be a task that we can do without consciously thinking about it, such as riding a bike.  Slow-wave, or non-REM (NREM) sleep, is associated with the consolidation of declarative (explicit) memories.  These are facts that need to be consciously remembered, such as dates for a history class. 

Systematics<====>27813<====>Systematics Biological systematics is the study of the diversification of living forms, both past and present, and the relationships among living things through time.  Relationships are visualized as evolutionary trees (synonyms: cladograms, phylogenetic trees, phylogenies).   Phylogenies have two components: branching order (showing group relationships) and branch length (showing amount of evolution).   Phylogenetic trees of species and higher taxa are used to study the evolution of traits (e. g. , anatomical or molecular characteristics) and the distribution of organisms (biogeography).  Systematics, in other words, is used to understand the evolutionary history of life on Earth. 

Sleep<====>27834<====>Sleep    Sleep is a naturally recurring state of mind and body, characterized by altered consciousness, relatively inhibited sensory activity, inhibition of nearly all voluntary muscles, and reduced interactions with surroundings.It is distinguished from wakefulness by a decreased ability to react to stimuli, but is more easily reversed than the state of being comatose.  Sleep occurs in repeating periods, in which the body alternates between two distinct modes known as non-REM and REM sleep.  Although REM stands for "rapid eye movement", this mode of sleep has many other aspects, including virtual paralysis of the body. 

Superoxide dismutase<====>27837<====>Superoxide dismutase Superoxide dismutase (SOD,  ) is an enzyme that alternately catalyzes the dismutation (or partitioning) of the superoxide (O 2  − ) radical into either ordinary molecular oxygen (O 2 ) or hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ).  Superoxide is produced as a by-product of oxygen metabolism and, if not regulated, causes many types of cell damage.   Hydrogen peroxide is also damaging and is degraded by other enzymes such as catalase.  Thus, SOD is an important antioxidant defense in nearly all living cells exposed to oxygen.  One exception is Lactobacillus plantarum and related lactobacilli, which use a different mechanism to prevent damage from reactive (O 2  − ). 

Sequence<====>27838<====>Sequence In mathematics, a sequence is an enumerated collection of objects in which repetitions are allowed.   Like a set, it contains members (also called elements, or terms).   The number of elements (possibly infinite) is called the length of the sequence.   Unlike a set, order matters, and exactly the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in the sequence.   Formally, a sequence can be defined as a function whose domain is either the set of the natural numbers (for infinite sequences) or the set of the first n natural numbers (for a sequence of finite length n). 

Senryū<====>27840<====>Senryū    is a Japanese form of short poetry similar to haiku in construction: three lines with 17  morae (or "on", often translated as syllables, but see the article on onji for distinctions).  Senryū tend to be about human foibles while haiku tend to be about nature, and senryū are often cynical or darkly humorous while haiku are more serious.  Unlike haiku, senryū do not include a kireji (cutting word), and do not generally include a kigo, or season word.  Form and contentSenryū is named after Edo period haikai poet Senryū Karai (柄井川柳, 1718-1790), whose collection   launched the genre into the public consciousness.

Sorious Samura<====>27846<====>Sorious SamuraSorious Samura (born 27 October 1963) is a Sierra Leonean journalist.  He is best known for two CNN documentary films: Cry Freetown (2000) and Exodus from Africa (2001).  The self-funded Cry Freetown depicts the most brutal period of the civil war in Sierra Leone with RUF rebels capturing the capital city (January 1999).The film won, among other awards, an Emmy Award and a Peabody.   Exodus from Africa shows the harrowing effort by the best of young African male blood to break through to Europe via death- and danger-ridden paths from Sierra Leone and Nigeria, via Mali, the Sahara desert, Algeria, and Morocco through the Strait of Gibraltar to Spain. 

Sandpit<====>27847<====>Sandpit   A sandpit (Commonwealth countries) or sandbox (US/Canada) is a low, wide container or shallow depression filled with soft (beach) sand in which children can play.  Sharp sand (as used in the building industry) is not suitable.  Many homeowners with children build sandpits in their backyards because, unlike much playground equipment, they can be easily and cheaply constructed.  A "sandpit" may also denote an open pit sand mine.   The "pit" or "box" itself is simply a container for storing the sand so that it does not spread outward across lawns or other surrounding surfaces. 

Steve Wozniak<====>27848<====>Steve Wozniak   Stephen Gary Wozniak ( ; born on August 11, 1950), also nicknamed "The Woz", is an American inventor, electronics engineer, programmer, philanthropist, and technology entrepreneur who co-founded Apple Inc.  He is known as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Wozniak single-handedly developed the 1976 Apple I, which was the computer that launched Apple.  He primarily designed the 1977 Apple II, known as one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers,  while Jobs oversaw the development of its foam-molded plastic case and Rod Holt developed the switching power supply. 

Saxons<====>27850<====>Saxons  The Saxons ( ,  ,  ,  ) were a group of Germanic tribes first mentioned as living near the North Sea coast of what is now Germany (Old Saxony), in the late Roman Empire.  They were soon mentioned as raiding and settling in many North Sea areas, as well as pushing south inland towards the Franks.  Significant numbers settled in large parts of Great Britain in the early Middle Ages and formed part of the merged group of Anglo-Saxons who eventually organised the first united Kingdom of England.Many Saxons however remained in Germania (Old Saxony c. 

Superparamagnetism<====>27852<====>SuperparamagnetismSuperparamagnetism is a form of magnetism which appears in small ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic nanoparticles.  In sufficiently small nanoparticles, magnetization can randomly flip direction under the influence of temperature.  The typical time between two flips is called the Néel relaxation time.  In the absence of an external magnetic field, when the time used to measure the magnetization of the nanoparticles is much longer than the Néel relaxation time, their magnetization appears to be in average zero; they are said to be in the superparamagnetic state.  In this state, an external magnetic field is able to magnetize the nanoparticles, similarly to a paramagnet. 

Separable space<====>27855<====>Separable space In mathematics a topological space is called separable if it contains a countable, dense subset; that is, there exists a sequence  \{ x_n \}_{n=1}^{\infty}   of elements of the space such that every nonempty open subset of the space contains at least one element of the sequence. Like the other axioms of countability, separability is a "limitation on size", not necessarily in terms of cardinality (though, in the presence of the Hausdorff axiom, this does turn out to be the case; see below) but in a more subtle topological sense.   In particular, every continuous function on a separable space whose image is a subset of a Hausdorff space is determined by its values on the countable dense subset. 

Schrödinger's cat<====>27856<====>Schrödinger's cat  Schrödinger's cat is a thought experiment, sometimes described as a paradox, devised by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935.It illustrates what he saw as the problem of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics applied to everyday objects.  The scenario presents a cat that may be simultaneously both alive and dead,  a state known as a quantum superposition, as a result of being linked to a random subatomic event that may or may not occur. 

Sphere<====>27859<====>Sphere   A sphere (from Greek   — sphaira, "globe, ball" ) is a perfectly round geometrical object in three-dimensional space that is the surface of a completely round ball, (viz. , analogous to a circular object in two dimensions). Like a circle, which geometrically is an object in two-dimensional space, a sphere is defined mathematically as the set of points that are all at the same distance   from a given point, but in three-dimensional space.This distance   is the radius of the ball, and the given point is the center of the mathematical ball.

Sydney<====>27862<====>SydneySydney ( )  is the state capital of New South Wales and the most populous city in Australia and Oceania.Located on Australia's east coast, the metropolis surrounds the world's largest natural harbour and sprawls about   on its periphery towards the Blue Mountains to the west, Hawkesbury to the north and Macarthur to the south.   Sydney is made up of 658 suburbs, 40 local government areas and 15 contiguous regions.  Residents of the city are known as "Sydneysiders".   As at June 2016 Sydney's estimated population was 5,029,768. 

Sword<====>27863<====>Sword   A sword is a bladed weapon intended for slashing or thrusting that is longer than a knife or dagger.  The precise definition of the term varies with the historical epoch or the geographical region under consideration.  A sword consists of a long blade attached to a hilt.   The blade can be straight or curved.   Thrusting swords have a pointed tip on the blade, and tend to be straighter; slashing swords have a sharpened cutting edge on one or both sides of the blade, and are more likely to be curved.   Many swords are designed for both thrusting and slashing. 

Surface (topology)<====>27865<====>Surface (topology) In topology and differential geometry, a surface is a two-dimensional manifold, and, as such, may be an "abstract surface" not embedded in any Euclidean space.  For example, the Klein bottle is a surface, which cannot be represented in the three-dimensional Euclidean space without introducing self-intersections (it cannot be embedded in the three dimensional Euclidean space). In general In mathematics, a surface is a geometrical shape that resembles a deformed plane.  The most familiar examples arise as boundaries of solid objects in ordinary three-dimensional Euclidean space R 3 , such as spheres.  The exact definition of a surface may depend on the context.

Surjective function<====>27873<====>Surjective function  In mathematics, a function f from a set X to a set Y is surjective (or onto), or a surjection, if for every element y in the codomain Y of f there is at least one element x in the domain X of f such that f(x) = y.  It is not required that x is unique; the function f may map one or more elements of X to the same element of Y. The term surjective and the related terms injective and bijective were introduced by Nicolas Bourbaki,  a group of mainly French 20th-century mathematicians who under this pseudonym wrote a series of books presenting an exposition of modern advanced mathematics, beginning in 1935. 

Stephen Jay Gould<====>27875<====>Stephen Jay Gould   Stephen Jay Gould ( ; September 10, 1941 – May 20, 2002) was an American paleontologist, evolutionary biologist, and historian of science.  He was also one of the most influential and widely read writers of popular science of his generation.Gould spent most of his career teaching at Harvard University and working at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.  In 1996 Gould was hired as the Vincent Astor Visiting Research Professor of Biology at New York University, where he divided his time teaching there and at Harvard. 

Skíðblaðnir<====>27879<====>Skíðblaðnir Skíðblaðnir (Old Norse 'assembled from thin pieces of wood' Simek (2007:289).  ), sometimes anglicized as Skidbladnir or Skithblathnir, is the best of ships in Norse mythology.  It is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and in the Prose Edda and Heimskringla, both written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson.  All sources note that the ship is the finest of ships, and the Poetic Edda and Prose Edda attest that it is owned by the god Freyr, while the euhemerized account in Heimskringla attributes it to the magic of Odin. 

Sleipnir<====>27881<====>Sleipnir In Norse mythology, Sleipnir (Old Norse "slippy" Orchard (1997:151).   or "the slipper" Kermode (1904:6).  ) is an eight-legged horse ridden by Odin.  Sleipnir is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson.  In both sources, Sleipnir is Odin's steed, is the child of Loki and Svaðilfari, is described as the best of all horses, and is sometimes ridden to the location of Hel.  The Prose Edda contains extended information regarding the circumstances of Sleipnir's birth, and details that he is grey in color. 

Walter Scott<====>27884<====>Walter Scott   Sir Walter Scott, 1st Baronet, FRSE (15 August 1771 – 21 September 1832) was a Scottish historical novelist, playwright, poet and historian.  Many of his works remain classics of both English-language literature and of Scottish literature.  Famous titles include Ivanhoe, Rob Roy, Old Mortality, The Lady of the Lake, Waverley, The Heart of Midlothian and The Bride of Lammermoor. Although primarily remembered for his extensive literary works and his political engagement, Scott was an advocate, judge and legal administrator by profession, and throughout his career combined his writing and editing work with his daily occupation as Clerk of Session and Sheriff-Depute of Selkirkshire. 

Savoy<====>27885<====>Savoy  Savoy ( ;   ,  ;    ;    ;    ) is a cultural region in Western Europe.  It comprises roughly the territory of the Western Alps between Lake Geneva in the north and Dauphiné in the south. The historical land of Savoy emerged as the feudal territory of the House of Savoy during the 11th to 14th centuries.  The historical territory is shared between the modern countries of France, Italy, and Switzerland. Installed by Rudolph III, King of Burgundy, officially in 1003, the House of Savoy became the longest surviving royal house in Europe. 

Suffolk<====>27886<====>Suffolk    Suffolk ( ) is an East Anglian county of historic origin in England.   It has borders with Norfolk to the north, Cambridgeshire to the west and Essex to the south.  The North Sea lies to the east.   The county town is Ipswich; other important towns include Lowestoft, Bury St Edmunds, Newmarket and Felixstowe, one of the largest container ports in Europe.  The county is low-lying with very few hills, and is largely arable land with the wetlands of the Broads in the north.  The Suffolk Coast and Heaths are an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. 

Scylla<====>27888<====>Scylla In Greek mythology, Scylla  (   ;  ,  , Skylla) was a monster that lived on one side of a narrow channel of water, opposite her counterpart Charybdis.  The two sides of the strait were within an arrow's range of each other—so close that sailors attempting to avoid Charybdis would pass dangerously close to Scylla and vice versa. Scylla made her first appearance in Homer's Odyssey, where Odysseus and his crew encounter her and Charybdis on their travels.  Later myth gave her an origin story as a beautiful nymph who gets turned into a monster.

Glossary of patience terms<====>27893<====>Glossary of patience termsThere are a number of common features in many Patience games or solitaire games as they are called in the US, such as "building down" and the "foundations" and "tableau", used to simplify the description of new games.  Deal termsCascadeCards are built on one another, starting from the bottom up.   Each card's value and suit is face up, and should be able to be viewed by the player.   However, only the top card is available for play.   It is most commonly found in addition games. Layout termsThe layout describes the piles of cards in use during the game, and the restrictions on these piles. 

Syrinx<====>27899<====>Syrinx  In classical Greek mythology, Syrinx   (Greek Σύριγξ) was a nymph and a follower of Artemis, known for her chastity.  Pursued by the amorous god Pan, she ran to a river's edge and asked for assistance from the river nymphs.   In answer, she was transformed into hollow water reeds that made a haunting sound when the god's frustrated breath blew across them.  Pan cut the reeds to fashion the first set of pan pipes, which were thenceforth known as syrinx.   The word syringe was derived from this word. In literatureThe story of the syrinx is told in Achilles Tatius' Leukippe and Kleitophon where the heroine is subjected to a virginity test by entering a cave where Pan has left syrinx pipes that will sound a melody if she passes. 

Savate<====>27901<====>Savate    Savate ( ), also known as boxe française,  French boxing, French kickboxing or French footfighting, is a French martial art that uses the hands and feet as weapons combining elements of western boxing with graceful kicking techniques.   Only foot kicks are allowed, unlike some systems such as Muay Thai, Silat and Yaw-Yan, which allow the use of the knees or shins.  Savate is a French word for "old shoe".  Savate is one of the few styles of kickboxing in which the fighters habitually wear shoes.  A male practitioner of savate is called a tireur while a female is called a tireuse. 

Sextus Julius Africanus<====>27903<====>Sextus Julius AfricanusFor the first century orator, see Julius Africanus.  For others with this name, see Africanus. Sextus Julius Africanus (c.  160 – c.  240) was a Christian traveler and historian of the late second and early third centuries.  He is important chiefly because of his influence on Eusebius, on all the later writers of Church history among the Church Fathers, and on the whole Greek school of chroniclers. BiographyThe Suidas claims Africanus was a "Libyan philosopher", while Gelzer considers him of Roman descent.   Julius called himself a native of Jerusalem – which some scholars consider his birthplace  – and lived at the neighbouring Emmaus. 

Agnes of Rome<====>27904<====>Agnes of Rome  Agnes of Rome ( ) is a virgin–martyr, venerated as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, the Anglican Communion, and Lutheranism.  She is one of seven women who, along with the Blessed Virgin, are commemorated by name in the Canon of the Mass.  She is the patron saint of chastity, gardeners, girls, engaged couples, rape survivors, virgins, and the Children of Mary. Agnes is depicted in art with a lamb, from the Latin word for "lamb", agnus.  However, the name "Agnes" is actually derived from the feminine Greek adjective hagnē (ἁγνή) meaning "chaste, pure, sacred". 

Sichuan cuisine<====>27908<====>Sichuan cuisine   Sichuan cuisine, Szechwan cuisine, or Szechuan cuisine (四川菜) (  or   ) is a style of Chinese cuisine originating from Sichuan Province in southwestern China.  It has bold flavours, particularly the pungency and spiciness resulting from liberal use of garlic and chili peppers, as well as the unique flavour of Sichuan pepper.  There are many local variations within Sichuan Province and the neighbouring Chongqing Municipality, which was part of Sichuan Province until 1997.  Four sub-styles of Sichuan cuisine include Chongqing, Chengdu, Zigong and Buddhist vegetarian style.  UNESCO declared Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, to be a city of gastronomy in 2011 to recognise the sophistication of its cooking. 

Shanghai cuisine<====>27909<====>Shanghai cuisine   Shanghai cuisine (上海菜), also known as Hu cuisine (滬菜), is a popular style of Chinese food.  In a narrow sense, Shanghai cuisine refers only to what is traditionally called Benbang cuisine ( ) which originated in Shanghai; in a broad sense, it refers to complex and developed styles of cooking under profound influence of those of the surrounding provinces, Jiangsu and Zhejiang.  It takes "colour, aroma and taste" as its elements, like other Chinese regional cuisines, and emphasises in particular the use of seasonings, the quality of raw ingredients and original flavours. CharacteristicShanghai dishes usually appear red and shiny because they are often pickled in wine. 

Soul food<====>27910<====>Soul food    Soul food is a variety of cuisine originating in the Southeastern United States.  It is common in areas with a history of slave-based plantations and has maintained popularity among the Black American and American Deep-South "cotton state" communities for centuries; it is now the most common regional cuisine in southern cities such as Charleston (South Carolina), New Orleans (Louisiana), Houston (Texas), Charlotte (North Carolina) Birmingham (Alabama) and Atlanta (Georgia).  Soul food influences can be commonly found as far north as Richmond, Virginia, as far east as Jacksonville, Florida, and as far west as Houston, Texas. 

House of Sforza<====>27914<====>House of Sforza  The House of Sforza ( ) was a ruling family of Renaissance Italy, based in Milan.  They acquired the Duchy of Milan from the previously-ruling Visconti family in the mid-15th century, and lost it to the Spanish Habsburgs about a century later. HistoryRising from rural nobility of Lombardy, the Sforza family became condottieri and used this military position to become rulers in Milan.  The family governed by force, ruse, and power politics, similar to the Medici in Florence.  Under their rule, the city-state flourished and expanded. Muzio Attendolo (1369–1424), called Sforza (from sforzare, to exert or force), founded the dynasty. 

Septuagint<====>27915<====>Septuagint  The Septuagint (from the Latin  , "seventy"), also known as the LXX, is a Koine Greek translation of a Hebraic textual tradition that included certain texts which were later included in the canonical Hebrew Bible and other related texts which were not.  As the primary Greek translation of the Old Testament, it is also called the Greek Old Testament.  This translation is quoted a number of times in the New Testament,   particularly in Pauline epistles, "His quotations from Scripture, which are all taken, directly or from memory, from the Greek version, betray no familiarity with the original Hebrew text (. 

Codex Sinaiticus<====>27916<====>Codex Sinaiticus   Codex Sinaiticus ( ,  ; Shelfmarks and references: London, Brit.

The codex is a celebrated historical treasure.  The codex is an Alexandrian text-type manuscript written in the 4th century in uncial letters on parchment.  Scholarship considers the Codex Sinaiticus to be one of the best Greek texts of the New Testament,    along with the Codex Vaticanus. 

St. John Fisher College<====>27917<====>St.  John Fisher College  St.  John Fisher College is a private liberal arts college located in Pittsford, New York, United States, an eastern suburb of Rochester.  Fisher is ranked by U. S.  News & World Report among the Doctoral Research Universities (DRU), which reflects the college's growth in the area of doctoral program offerings.  It is named after John Fisher (1469–1535), an English Catholic bishop, cardinal, theologian, and martyr, who presided over the Diocese of Rochester, Kent, England, and is venerated by Roman Catholics as a saint. HistorySt.  John Fisher College was founded as a men's college in 1948 by the Basilian Fathers and with the aid of James E. 

Scouting<====>27918<====>Scouting   Scouting or the Scout Movement is a movement that aims to support young people in their physical, mental and spiritual development, that they may play constructive roles in society, with a strong focus on the outdoors and survival skills. During the first half of the twentieth century, the movement grew to encompass three major age groups for boys (Cub Scout, Boy Scout, Rover Scout) and, in 1910, a new organization, Girl Guides, was created for girls (Brownie Guide, Girl Guide and Girl Scout, Ranger Guide).  It is one of several worldwide youth organizations. In 1906 and 1907 Robert Baden-Powell, a lieutenant general in the British Army, wrote a book for boys about reconnaissance and  . 

Sociobiology<====>27919<====>Sociobiology  Sociobiology is a field of biology that aims to examine and explain social behavior in terms of evolution.  It draws from disciplines including ethology, anthropology, evolution, zoology, archaeology, and population genetics.  Within the study of human societies, sociobiology is closely allied to Darwinian anthropology, human behavioral ecology and evolutionary psychology. Sociobiology investigates social behaviors such as mating patterns, territorial fights, pack hunting, and the hive society of social insects.  It argues that just as selection pressure led to animals evolving useful ways of interacting with the natural environment, so also it led to the genetic evolution of advantageous social behavior. 

Sharp-P<====>27924<====>Sharp-P In computational complexity theory, the complexity class #P (pronounced "number P" or, sometimes "sharp P" or "hash P") is the set of the counting problems associated with the decision problems in the set NP.  More formally, #P is the class of function problems of the form "compute f(x)", where f is the number of accepting paths of a nondeterministic Turing machine running in polynomial time.   Unlike most well-known complexity classes, it is not a class of decision problems but a class of function problems. Relation to decision problemsAn NP decision problem is often of the form "Are there any solutions that satisfy certain constraints?" For example:Are there any subsets of a list of integers that add up to zero? (subset sum problem)Are there any Hamiltonian cycles in a given graph with cost less than 100? (traveling salesman problem)Are there any variable assignments that satisfy a given CNF (conjunctive normal form) formula? (Boolean satisfiability problem or SAT)The corresponding #P function problems ask "how many" rather than "are there any". 

Sharp-P-complete<====>27925<====>Sharp-P-complete #P-complete, pronounced "sharp P complete" or "number P complete" is a complexity class in computational complexity theory.  By definition, a problem is #P-complete if and only if it is in , and every problem in #P can be reduced to it by a polynomial-time counting reduction, i. e.  a polynomial-time Turing reduction relating the cardinalities of solution sets.  In some cases parsimonious reductions, a more specific type of reduction that preserves the exact number of solutions, is used. For either type of reduction, a problem is #P-complete if and only if it is in , and for any polynomial time non-deterministic Turing machine, the problem of computing its number of accepting paths has a polynomial-time reduction to this problem.

Sedevacantism<====>27930<====>Sedevacantism  Sedevacantism is the position, held by a minority of traditionalist Catholics,  .    .   that the present occupant of the Holy See is not truly pope due to the mainstream church's espousal of the heresy of modernism and that, for lack of a valid pope, the see has  been vacant since the death of Pope Pius XII in 1958. The term "sedevacantism" is derived from the Latin phrase sede vacante, which literally means "with the chair [of Saint Peter] vacant".    The phrase is commonly used to refer specifically to a vacancy of the Holy See from the death or resignation of a pope to the election of his successor.

History of Stockholm<====>27939<====>History of Stockholm The history of Stockholm, capital of Sweden, for many centuries coincided with the development of what is today known as Gamla stan, the Stockholm Old Town.   Stockholm's   always was to be the Swedish capital and by far the largest city in the country. Origins The name 'Stockholm' easily splits into two distinct parts – Stock-holm, "Log-islet", but as no serious explanation to the name has been produced, various myths and legends have attempted to fill in the gap.   According to a 17th-century myth the population at the viking settlement Birka decided to found a new settlement, and to determine its location had a log bound with gold drifting in Lake Mälaren. 

Culture in Stockholm<====>27940<====>Culture in Stockholm Apart from being a large city with an active cultural life, Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, houses many national cultural institutions.

Sikhism<====>27964<====>Sikhism    Sikhism ( ,  ), or Sikhi   ,  , from Sikh, meaning a "disciple", or a "learner"), is a religion that originated in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent about the end of the 15th century. It is one of the youngest of the major world religions.  The fundamental beliefs of Sikhism, articulated in the sacred scripture Guru Granth Sahib, include constant spiritual meditation of God's name, being guided by the Guru instead of yielding to capriciousness of mind or psyche, living a householder's life instead of monasticism, truthful action to dharam (righteousness, moral duty), being of selfless service to others, equality of all human beings, and believing in God's grace. 

Structural isomer<====>27969<====>Structural isomer Structural isomerism, or constitutional isomerism (per IUPAC), is a form of isomerism in which molecules with the same molecular formula have different bonding patterns and atomic organization, as opposed to stereoisomerism, in which molecular bonds are always in the same order and only spatial arrangement differs.    There are multiple synonyms for constitutional isomers. Three categories of constitutional isomers are skeletal, positional, and functional isomers.  Positional isomers are also called regioisomers. Chain isomerismIn chain isomerism, or skeletal isomerism, components of the (usually carbon) skeleton are distinctly re-ordered to create different structures.  Pentane exists as three isomers: n-pentane (often called simply "pentane"), isopentane (2-methylbutane) and neopentane (dimethylpropane). 

Stereoisomerism<====>27970<====>StereoisomerismIn stereochemistry, stereoisomers are isomeric molecules that have the same molecular formula and sequence of bonded atoms (constitution), but differ in the three-dimensional orientations of their atoms in space.    This contrasts with structural isomers, which share the same molecular formula, but the bond connections or their order differs.  By definition, molecules that are stereoisomers of each other represent the same structural isomer. Enantiomers Enantiomers, also known as optical isomers, are two stereoisomers that are related to each other by a reflection: they are mirror images of each other that are non-superimposable.  Human hands are a macroscopic  analog of this. 

Sylvia Sayer<====>27972<====>Sylvia SayerSylvia Olive Pleadwell Sayer, Lady Sayer (6 March 1904 – 4 January 2000), was a passionate conservationist and environmental campaigner on behalf of Dartmoor,    an area of mostly granite moorland in Devon in the south-west of England.  She was chairman of the Dartmoor Preservation Association from 1951 to 1973, and remained deeply involved with the organisation until her death. BiographySayer's grandfather was Robert Burnard (1848–1920), who with Sabine Baring-Gould performed the first scientific excavations of ancient monuments on Dartmoor, including Grimspound; and who was one of the founding members in 1883 of the Dartmoor Preservation Association. 

South Park<====>27977<====>South Park South Park is an American adult animated sitcom created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone and developed by Brian Graden for the Comedy Central television network.  The show revolves around four boys—Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick—and their bizarre adventures in and around the titular Colorado town.  Much like The Simpsons, South Park uses a very large ensemble cast of recurring characters and became infamous for its profanity and dark, surreal humor that satirizes a wide range of topics towards a mature audience. Parker and Stone developed the show from The Spirit of Christmas, two consecutive animated shorts created in 1992 and 1995. 

Skin<====>27978<====>Skin   Skin is the soft outer tissue covering vertebrates. Other animal coverings, such as the arthropod exoskeleton, have different developmental origin, structure and chemical composition.  The adjective cutaneous means "of the skin" (from Latin cutis, skin).  In mammals, the skin is an organ of the integumentary system made up of multiple layers of ectodermal tissue, and guards the underlying muscles, bones, ligaments and internal organs.  Skin of a different nature exists in amphibians, reptiles, and birds.   All mammals have some hair on their skin, even marine mammals like whales, dolphins, and porpoises which appear to be hairless. 

Sunlight<====>27979<====>Sunlight  Sunlight is a portion of the electromagnetic radiation given off by the Sun, in particular infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light.  On Earth, sunlight is filtered through Earth's atmosphere, and is obvious as daylight when the Sun is above the horizon.  When the direct solar radiation is not blocked by clouds, it is experienced as sunshine, a combination of bright light and radiant heat.  When it is blocked by clouds or reflects off other objects, it is experienced as diffused light.  The World Meteorological Organization uses the term "sunshine duration" to mean the cumulative time during which an area receives direct irradiance from the Sun of at least 120 watts per square meter. 

Stellar evolution<====>27980<====>Stellar evolutionStellar evolution is the process by which a star changes over the course of time.  Depending on the mass of the star, its lifetime can range from a few million years for the most massive to trillions of years for the least massive, which is considerably longer than the age of the universe.  The table shows the lifetimes of stars as a function of their masses.   All stars are born from collapsing clouds of gas and dust, often called nebulae or molecular clouds.  Over the course of millions of years, these protostars settle down into a state of equilibrium, becoming what is known as a main-sequence star. 

Snake River<====>27982<====>Snake River  The Snake River is a major river of the greater Pacific Northwest in the United States.  At   long, it is the largest tributary of the Columbia River, the largest North American river that empties into the Pacific Ocean.   Rising in western Wyoming, the river flows through the Snake River Plain of southern Idaho, then through the rugged Hells Canyon area via northeastern Oregon and the rolling Palouse Hills, to reach its mouth near the Washington Tri-Cities area, where it enters the Columbia.  Its drainage basin encompasses parts of six U. S. 

Strong interaction<====>27984<====>Strong interaction   In particle physics, the strong interaction is the mechanism responsible for the strong nuclear force (also called the strong force or nuclear strong force), and is one of the four known fundamental interactions, with the others being electromagnetism, the weak interaction, and gravitation.  At the range of 10 −15  m (1 femtometer), the strong force is approximately 137 times as strong as electromagnetism, a million times as strong as the weak interaction, and 10 38  times as strong as gravitation.   The strong nuclear force holds most ordinary matter together because it confines quarks into hadron particles such as the proton and neutron.

Stout<====>27991<====>Stout   Stout is a dark beer made using roasted malt or roasted barley, hops, water and yeast.   Stouts were traditionally the generic term for the strongest or stoutest porters, typically 7% or 8% alcohol by volume (ABV), produced by a brewery.  The New Oxford Dictionary of English.  Oxford University Press 1998    Porter and Stout - CAMRA  There are a number of variations including Baltic porter, milk stout, and imperial stout; the most common variation is dry stout, exemplified by Guinness Draught, the world's best selling stout. The first known use of the word stout for beer was in a document dated 1677 found in the Egerton Manuscript, the sense being that a stout beer was a strong beer not a dark beer. 

Slavery<====>27992<====>Slavery Slavery is any system in which principles of property law are applied to people, allowing individuals to own, buy and sell other individuals, as a de jure form of property.   A slave is unable to withdraw unilaterally from such an arrangement and works without remuneration.  Many scholars now use the term chattel slavery to refer to this specific sense of legalised, de jure slavery.  In a broader sense, however, the word slavery may also refer to any situation in which an individual is de facto forced to work against their own will.

Supply chain management<====>27995<====>Supply chain management   In commerce, supply chain management (SCM), the management of the flow of goods and services,  involves the movement and storage of raw materials, of work-in-process inventory, and of finished goods from point of origin to point of consumption.  Interconnected or interlinked networks, channels and node businesses combine in the provision of products and services required by end customers in a supply chain.   Supply-chain management has been defined   as the "design, planning, execution, control, and monitoring of supply chain activities with the objective of creating net value, building a competitive infrastructure, leveraging worldwide logistics, synchronizing supply with demand and measuring performance globally. 

Synchronised swimming<====>27998<====>Synchronised swimming   Synchronized swimming, (renamed as "artistic swimming"), is a hybrid form of swimming, dance, and gymnastics, consisting of swimmers performing a synchronised routine (either solo, duet, mixed duet, free team, free combination, and highlight) of elaborate moves in the water, accompanied by music. Synchronized swimming demands advanced water skills, and requires great strength, endurance, flexibility, grace, artistry and precise timing, as well as exceptional breath control when upside down underwater.  During routines, swimmers may not touch the bottom of the pool. Following the addition of a new mixed-pair event, FINA World Aquatics competitions are open to men since the 16th 2015 championships in Kazan, and the other international, national and provincial/state competitions allow male competitors in every event. 

Swimming<====>27999<====>Swimming  Swimming is the self-propulsion of a person through water or another liquid, usually for recreation, sport, exercise, or  .   Locomotion is achieved through coordinated movement of the limbs, the body, or both.   Humans can hold their breath underwater and undertake rudimentary locomotive swimming within weeks of birth, as an evolutionary response.  Swimming is consistently among top public recreational activities,and in some countries, swimming lessons are a compulsory part of the educational curriculum.    As a formalized sport, swimming features in a range of local, national, and international competitions, including every modern summer Olympics. 

Simple machine<====>28002<====>Simple machine   A  simple machine is a  mechanical device that changes the direction or magnitude of a force. In general, they can be defined as the simplest mechanisms that use mechanical advantage (also called leverage) to multiply force.  Usually the term refers to the six classical simple machines which were defined by Renaissance scientists:    LeverWheel and axlePulleyInclined planeWedgeScrewA simple machine uses a single applied force to do work against a single load force.    Ignoring friction losses, the work done on the load is equal to the work done by the applied force. 

Semi-Automatic Ground Environment<====>28005<====>Semi-Automatic Ground Environment  The Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE, a name selected to mean "wise") was a system of large computers and associated networking equipment that coordinated data from many radar sites and processed it to produce a single unified image of the airspace over a wide area.  SAGE directed and controlled the NORAD response to a Soviet air attack, operating in this role from the late 1950s into the 1980s.  Its enormous computers and huge displays remain a part of cold war lore, and a common prop in movies such as Dr.  Strangelove and Colossus. The processing power behind SAGE was supplied by the largest computer ever built, the AN/FSQ-7. 

Subgroup<====>28011<====>Subgroup   In group theory, a branch of mathematics, given a group G under a binary operation ∗, a subset H of G is called a subgroup of G if H also forms a group under the operation ∗.  More precisely, H is a subgroup of G if the restriction of ∗ to   is a group operation on H.  This is usually denoted  , read as "H is a subgroup of G". The trivial subgroup of any group is the subgroup {e} consisting of just the identity element. A proper subgroup of a group G is a subgroup H which is a proper subset of G (i. 

Silicon Graphics<====>28013<====>Silicon Graphics  Silicon Graphics, Inc.  (later rebranded SGI, historically known as Silicon Graphics Computer Systems or SGCS) was an American high-performance computing manufacturer, producing computer hardware and software.  Founded in Mountain View, California in November 1981 by Jim Clark, its initial market was 3D graphics computer workstations, but its products, strategies and market positions developed significantly over time. Early systems were based on the Geometry Engine that Clark and Marc Hannah had developed at Stanford University, and were derived from Clark's broader background in computer graphics.  The Geometry Engine was the first very-large-scale integration (VLSI) implementation of a geometry pipeline, specialized hardware that accelerated the "inner-loop" geometric computations needed to display three-dimensional images. 

Steiner system<====>28016<====>Steiner system is an S(2,3,7) Steiner triple system.  The blocks are the 7 lines, each containing 3 points.  Every pair of points belongs to a unique line. ]]In combinatorial mathematics, a Steiner system (named after Jakob Steiner) is a type of block design, specifically a t-design with λ = 1 and t ≥ 2. A Steiner system with parameters t, k, n, written S(t,k,n), is an n-element set S together with a set of k-element subsets of S (called blocks) with the property that each t-element subset of S is contained in exactly one block.  In an alternate notation for block designs, an S(t,k,n) would be a t-(n,k,1) design. 

Sirius<====>28017<====>Sirius    Sirius ( , a romanization of Greek  , Seirios,  .  "glowing" or "scorching") is a star system and the brightest star in the Earth's night sky.  With a visual apparent magnitude of −1. 46, it is almost twice as bright as Canopus, the next brightest star.  The system has the Bayer designation Alpha Canis Majoris (α CMa).  What the naked eye perceives as a single star is a binary star system, consisting of a white main-sequence star of spectral type A0 or A1, termed Sirius A, and a faint white dwarf companion of spectral type DA2, called Sirius B.

School<====>28022<====>School   A school is an institution designed to provide learning spaces and learning environments for the teaching of students (or "pupils") under the direction of teachers.  Most countries have systems of formal education, which is commonly compulsory.   In these systems, students progress through a series of schools.  The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the Regional section below) but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education.  An institution where higher education is taught, is commonly called a university college or university. 

Sontaran<====>28024<====>Sontaran    The Sontarans are a fictional extraterrestrial agendered race of humanoids from the British science fiction television series Doctor Who, and also seen in spin-off series The Sarah Jane Adventures.  A warrior race who live to kill, they are characterised by their ruthlessness and fearlessness of death. They were created by writer Robert Holmes.  During rehearsals for their first appearance, actor Kevin Lindsay, who portrayed the original Sontaran, Linx, pronounced the race's name as "son-TAR-an. "  Alan Bromly, the director, tried to correct him by saying it should be pronounced with the stress on the first syllable. 

Skateboarding<====>28027<====>Skateboarding   Skateboarding is an action sport which involves riding and performing tricks using a skateboard.  Skateboarding can also be considered a recreational activity, an art form, a job, or a method of transportation.   Skateboarding has been shaped and influenced by many skateboarders throughout the years.  A 2009 report found that the skateboarding market is worth an estimated $4. 8 billion in annual revenue with 11. 08 million active skateboarders in the world.   In 2016, it was announced that skateboarding will be represented at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan.  Since the 1970s, skateparks have been constructed specifically for use by skateboarders, Freestyle BMXers, aggressive skaters, and very recently, scooters. 

Speed skating<====>28028<====>Speed skating   Speed skating is a competitive form of ice skating in which the competitors race each other in travelling a certain distance on skates.  Types of speed skating are long track speed skating, short track speed skating, and marathon speed skating.  In the Olympic Games, long-track speed skating is usually referred to as just "speed skating", while short-track speed skating is known as "short track".   The ISU, the governing body of both ice sports, refers to long track as "speed skating" and short track as "short track skating". The standard rink for long track is 400 meters long, but tracks of 200, 250 and 333⅓ meters are used occasionally.

Scanning electron microscope<====>28034<====>Scanning electron microscope  A scanning electron microscope (SEM) is a type of electron microscope that produces images of a sample by scanning the surface with a focused beam of electrons.  The electrons interact with atoms in the sample, producing various signals that contain information about the sample's surface topography and composition.  The electron beam is scanned in a raster scan pattern, and the beam's position is combined with the detected signal to produce an image.  SEM can achieve resolution better than 1 nanometer.  Specimens can be observed in high vacuum in conventional SEM, or in low vacuum or wet conditions in variable pressure or environmental SEM, and at a wide range of cryogenic or elevated temperatures with specialized instruments. 

Timeline of the September 11 attacks<====>28044<====>Timeline of the September 11 attacks The September 11 attacks timeline is a chronological list of all the major events leading up to, during, and immediately following the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington that day.  The timeline starts with the completion of the first World Trade Center tower in 1970 through the first anniversary of the attacks in 2002. Background history1970: The North Tower of the original World Trade Center is completed. 1973: The South Tower of the original World Trade Center is completed. 1988: Osama bin Laden founds al-Qaeda.  1993: World Trade Center bombing. 1994: Al-Qaeda-connected militants attempt to crash passenger jet into Eiffel Tower. 

Hijackers in the September 11 attacks<====>28045<====>Hijackers in the September 11 attacksThe hijackers in the September 11 attacks were 19 men affiliated with al-Qaeda.  Fifteen of the 19 were citizens of Saudi Arabia, and the others were from the United Arab Emirates (2), Egypt, and Lebanon.   The hijackers were organized into four teams, each led by a pilot-trained hijacker with three or four "muscle hijackers," who were trained to help subdue the pilots, passengers, and crew. The first hijackers to arrive in the United States were Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, who settled in San Diego County, California, in January 2000.  They were followed by three hijacker-pilots, Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah in mid-2000 to undertake flight training in south Florida. 

Closings and cancellations following the September 11 attacks<====>28046<====>Closings and cancellations following the September 11 attacks  Many closings and cancellations followed the September 11 attacks, including major landmarks, buildings, restrictions on access to Lower Manhattan, and postponement or cancellation of major sporting and other events.   Landmarks were closed primarily because of fears that they may be attacked.  At some places, streets leading up to the institutions were also closed.  When they reopened, there was heightened security.  Many states declared a state of emergency.   Lower ManhattanSpeaking at a press conference at 11:02am on the morning of the attacks, Mayor Giuliani told New Yorkers: "If you are south of Canal Street, get out. 

Memorials and services for the September 11 attacks<====>28047<====>Memorials and services for the September 11 attacks  The first memorials to the victims of the September 11 attacks in 2001 began to take shape online, as hundreds of webmasters posted their own thoughts, links to the Red Cross and other rescue agencies, photos, and eyewitness accounts.  Numerous online September 11 memorials began appearing a few hours after the attacks, although many of these memorials were only temporary.   Around the world, U. S.  embassies and consulates became makeshift memorials as people came out to pay their respects. The Tribute in Light was the first major physical memorial at the World Trade Center site. 

Airport security repercussions due to the September 11 attacks<====>28051<====>Airport security repercussions due to the September 11 attacks After the September 11 attacks, questions were raised regarding the effectiveness of airport security at the time, as all 19 hijackers involved in 9/11 managed to pass existing checkpoints and board the airplanes without incident.  In the months and years following September 11, 2001, security at many airports worldwide was escalated to deter similar terrorist plots.    Changes in airport securityPrior to September 11, 2001, airport screening was provided in the U. S.  by private companies contracted by the airline or airport.  In November 2001, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was introduced to take over all of the security functions of the FAA, the airlines, and the airports. 

U.S. government response to the September 11 attacks<====>28061<====>U. S.  government response to the September 11 attacks  The response of the U. S.  government to the September 11 attacks sparked investigations into the motivations and execution of the attacks, as well as the ongoing War on Terrorism in Afghanistan The response included funds for affected families, plans for the War on Terrorism, rebuilding of Lower-East Manhattan, and the invasion and investigation of Iraq and Afghanistan. Rescue, recovery, and compensation Within hours of the attack, a massive search and rescue (SAR) operation was launched, which included over 350 search and rescue dogs.   Initially, only a handful of wounded people were found at the site, and in the weeks that followed it became evident that there weren't any survivors to be found. 

Financial assistance following the September 11 attacks<====>28064<====>Financial assistance following the September 11 attacks Charities and relief agencies raised over $657 million in the three weeks following the September 11, 2001 attacks, the vast bulk going to immediate survivors and victims' families. Government assistanceOn September 21, 2001, the Congress approved a bill  to aid the airline industry and establish a federal fund for victims.  The cost of the mostly open-ended fund reached $7 billion (the average payout was $1. 8 million per family).  Victims of earlier terrorist attacks, including those linked to al-Qaida, were not included in the fund—nor were those who would not surrender the right to hold the airlines legally responsible. 

Rescue and recovery effort after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center<====>28066<====>Rescue and recovery effort after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade CenterThe local, state, federal and global reaction to the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center was unprecedented.  The equally unsurpassed events of that day elicited the largest response of local emergency and rescue personnel to assist in the evacuation of the two towers and also contributed to the largest loss of the same personnel when the towers collapsed.   After the attacks, the media termed the World Trade Center site "Ground Zero", while rescue personnel referred to it as "the Pile". In the ensuing recovery and cleanup efforts, personnel related to metalwork and construction professions would descend on the site to offer their services and remained until the site was cleared in May 2002. 

Communication during the September 11 attacks<====>28070<====>Communication during the September 11 attacksCommunication problems and successes played an important role in the September 11, 2001 attacks and their aftermath.  Systems were variously destroyed or overwhelmed by loads greater than they were designed to carry, or failed to operate as intended or desired. AttackersThe organizers of the September 11, 2001 attacks apparently planned and coordinated their mission in face to face meetings and used little or no electronic communication.  This "radio silence" made their plan more difficult to detect.    Federal governmentAccording to 9/11 Commission staff statement No.  17  there were several communications failures at the federal government level during and after the 9/11 attacks.

Strategic Air Command<====>28118<====>Strategic Air Command    Strategic Air Command (SAC) was both a Department of Defense Specified Command and a United States Air Force (USAF) Major Command (MAJCOM), responsible for Cold War command and control of two of the three components of the U. S.  military's strategic nuclear strike forces, the so-called "nuclear triad," with SAC having control of land-based strategic bomber aircraft and intercontinental ballistic missiles or ICBMs (the other being submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM)). SAC also operated all strategic reconnaissance aircraft, all strategic airborne command post aircraft, and all USAF aerial refueling aircraft, to include those in the Air Force Reserve (AFRES) and Air National Guard (ANG). 

Scheme (programming language)<====>28119<====>Scheme (programming language) Scheme is a functional programming language and one of the two main dialects of the programming language Lisp.   Unlike Common Lisp, the other main dialect, Scheme follows a minimalist design philosophy specifying a small standard core with powerful tools for language extension. Scheme was created during the 1970s at the MIT AI Lab and released by its developers, Guy L.  Steele and Gerald Jay Sussman, via a series of memos now known as the Lambda Papers.  It was the first dialect of Lisp to choose lexical scope and the first to require implementations to perform tail-call optimization, giving stronger support for functional programming and associated techniques such as recursive algorithms. 

Society for Psychical Research<====>28122<====>Society for Psychical Research   The Society for Psychical Research (SPR) is a nonprofit organisation in the United Kingdom.  Its stated purpose is to understand events and abilities commonly described as psychic or paranormal.  It describes itself as the "first society to conduct organised scholarly research into human experiences that challenge contemporary scientific models. " SPR website  It does not, however, since its inception in 1882, hold any corporate opinions: SPR members assert a variety of beliefs with regard to the  nature of the phenomena studied.  OriginsThe Society for Psychical Research (SPR) originated from a discussion between journalist Edmund Rogers and the physicist William F. 

Sniper<====>28123<====>Sniper    Range findingThe range to the target is measured or estimated as precisely as conditions permit and correct range estimation becomes absolutely critical at long ranges, because a bullet travels with a curved trajectory and the sniper must compensate for this by aiming higher at longer distances.   If the exact distance is not known the sniper may compensate incorrectly and the bullet path may be too high or low.  As an example, for a typical military sniping cartridge such as 7. 62×51mm NATO (. 308 Winchester) M118 Special Ball round this difference (or “drop”) from   is  . 

Sign<====>28130<====>Sign A sign is an object, quality, event, or entity whose presence or occurrence indicates the probable presence or occurrence of something else.   A natural sign bears a causal relation to its object—for instance, thunder is a sign of storm, or medical symptoms signify a disease.  A conventional sign signifies by agreement, as a full stop signifies the end of a sentence; similarly the words and expressions of a language, as well as bodily gestures, can be regarded as signs, expressing particular meanings.  The physical objects most commonly referred to as signs (notices, road signs, etc. 

Standard Alphabet by Lepsius<====>28131<====>Standard Alphabet by LepsiusThe Standard Alphabet is a Latin-script alphabet developed by Karl Richard Lepsius.  Lepsius initially used it to transcribe Egyptian hieroglyphs  and extended it to write African languages, published in 1854  and 1855,  and in a revised edition in 1863.   The alphabet was comprehensive but was not used much as it contained a lot of diacritic marks and was difficult to read and typeset at that time. VowelsVowel length is indicated by a macron (ā) or a breve (ă) for long and short vowels, respectively.  Open vowels are marked by a line under the letter (e̱), while a dot below the letter makes it a close vowel (ẹ). 

Sidehill gouger<====>28132<====>Sidehill gougerSidehill gougers are North American folkloric creatures adapted to living on hillsides by having legs on one side of their body shorter than the legs on the opposite side.  This peculiarity allows them to walk on steep hillsides, although only in one direction; when lured or chased into the plain, they are trapped in an endless circular path.  The creature is variously known as the Sidehill Ousel, Sidehill Loper, Gyascutus, Sidewinder, Wampus, Gudaphro, Hunkus, Rickaboo Racker, Prock, Gwinter, or Cutter Cuss.

Serpens<====>28149<====>Serpens   Serpens ("the Serpent", Greek  ) is a constellation of the northern hemisphere.  One of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, it remains one of the 88 modern constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union.  It is unique among the modern constellations in being split into two non-contiguous parts, Serpens Caput (Serpent Head) to the west and Serpens Cauda (Serpent Tail) to the east.  Between these two halves lies the constellation of Ophiuchus, the "Serpent-Bearer".   In figurative representations, the body of the serpent is represented as passing behind Ophiuchus between Mu Serpentis in Serpens Caput and Nu Serpentis in Serpens Cauda. 

Sculptor Group<====>28150<====>Sculptor Group The Sculptor Group is a loose group of galaxies  near the south galactic pole.    The group is one of the closest groups of galaxies to the Local Group; the distance to the center of the group from the Milky Way is approximately  .  The Sculptor Galaxy (NGC 253) and a few other galaxies form a gravitationally-bound core in the center of this group.   A few other galaxies at the periphery may be associated with the group but may not be gravitationally bound.   Because most of the galaxies in this group are actually weakly gravitationally bound, the group may also be described as a filament. 

State (polity)<====>28151<====>State (polity) In terms of a political entity, a state is any politically organized community living under a single system of government. States may or may not be sovereign.  For instance, federated states are members of a federal union, and may have only partial sovereignty, but are, nonetheless, states.   Some states are subject to external sovereignty or hegemony, in which ultimate sovereignty lies in another state.   States that are sovereign are known as sovereign states. The term "state" can also refer to the secular branches of government within a state,  often as a manner of contrasting them with churches and civilian institutions. 

Stevia<====>28152<====>Stevia  Stevia ( )   is a sweetener and sugar substitute extracted from the leaves of the plant species Stevia rebaudiana. The active compounds of stevia are steviol glycosides (mainly stevioside and rebaudioside), which have up to 150 times the sweetness of sugar,  are heat-stable, pH-stable, and not fermentable.Stevia's taste has a slower onset and longer duration than that of sugar, and some of its extracts may have a bitter or licorice-like aftertaste at high concentrations. The legal status of stevia as a food additive or dietary supplement varies from country to country. 

Search for extraterrestrial intelligence<====>28153<====>Search for extraterrestrial intelligence  The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) is a collective term for scientific searches for intelligent extraterrestrial life, for example, monitoring electromagnetic radiation for signs of transmissions from civilizations on other planets.   Scientific investigation began shortly after the advent of radio in the early 1900s, and focused international efforts have been going on since the 1980s.   In 2015 Stephen Hawking and Russian billionaire Yuri Milner announced a well-funded effort called the Breakthrough Initiatives.    HistoryEarly workThere have been many earlier searches for extraterrestrial intelligence within the Solar System. 

Sextans<====>28154<====>Sextans  Sextans is a minor equatorial constellation which was introduced in 1687 by Johannes Hevelius.  Its name is Latin for the astronomical sextant, an instrument that Hevelius made frequent use of in his observations. Notable features Sextans as a constellation covers a rather dim, sparse region of the sky.   It has only one star above the fifth magnitude, namely α Sextantis at 4. 49 m .   The constellation contains a few double stars, including γ, 35, and 40 Sextantis.   There are a few notable variable stars, including β, 25, 23 Sextantis, and LHS 292. 

Salem al-Hazmi<====>28156<====>Salem al-Hazmi Salem al-Hazmi ( ,  , also transliterated as Alhazmi) (February 2, 1981 – September 11, 2001) was one of five hijackers of American Airlines Flight 77 as part of the September 11 attacks. Hazmi had a relatively long history with al-Qaeda before being selected for the attacks.  He obtained a tourist visa through the Visa Express program and arrived in the United States in June 2001 where he would settle in New Jersey with other American 77 hijackers up until the attacks. On September 11, 2001, Hazmi boarded American Airlines Flight 77 and helped subdue the passengers and crew for Hani Hanjour, the pilot among the hijackers, to crash the plane into west facade of the Pentagon. 

Satsuma Province<====>28157<====>Satsuma Province  was an old province of Japan that is now the western half of Kagoshima Prefecture on the island of Kyūshū.   Its abbreviation is Sasshū (薩州). HistorySatsuma's provincial capital was Satsumasendai.  During the Sengoku period, Satsuma was a fief of the Shimazu daimyō, who ruled much of southern Kyūshū from their castle at Kagoshima city.  They were the initial patrons of Satsuma ware, which was later widely exported to the West. In 1871, with the abolition of feudal domains and the establishment of prefectures after the Meiji Restoration, the provinces of Satsuma and Ōsumi were combined to eventually establish Kagoshima Prefecture. 

List of brightest stars<====>28161<====>List of brightest stars This is a list of the brightest naked eye stars to +2. 50 magnitude, as determined by their maximum, total or combined apparent visual magnitudes as seen from Earth.  Although several of the brightest stars are also known close binary or multiple star systems, they do appear to the naked eye as single stars.  The given list below combines/adds the magnitudes of bright individual components.  Proper names in this list are those approved by the Working Group on Star NamesMeasurementApparent visual magnitudes of the brightest star can also be compared to non-stellar objects in our Solar System. 

List of nearest stars and brown dwarfs<====>28162<====>List of nearest stars and brown dwarfs This list contains all known stars and brown dwarfs at a distance of up to 5 parsecs (16. 3 light-years) from the Solar System.  In addition to the Solar System, there are another 56 stellar systems currently known lying within this distance.  These systems contain a total of 60 hydrogen-fusing stars (of which 50 are red dwarfs), 13 brown dwarfs, and 4 white dwarfs.  Despite the relative proximity of these objects to Earth, only nine of them have an apparent magnitude less than 6. 5, which means only about 12% of these objects can be observed with the naked eye. 

Sagitta<====>28163<====>Sagitta  Sagitta is a dim but distinctive constellation in the northern sky.  Its name is Latin for "arrow", and it should not be confused with the significantly larger constellation Sagittarius, the archer.  Although Sagitta is an ancient constellation, it has no star brighter than 3rd magnitude and has the third-smallest area of all constellations (only Equuleus and Crux are smaller).  It was included among the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union.  Located to the north of the equator, Sagitta can be seen from every location on Earth except within the Antarctic circle.

He was educated at Queens' College, Cambridge, and graduated B. A.  in 1697, MA.  in 1701, and B. D.  in 1710.   He became fellow of Jesus College and vicar of Swavesey, and in 1711 was chosen Adams Professor of Arabic in the university.  He had a large family, and his latter days were embittered by pecuniary embarrassments, which form the subject of a chapter in Isaac D'Israeli's Calamities of Authors.  The preface to the second volume of his History of the Saracens is dated from Cambridge Castle, where he lay a prisoner for debt. 

Sharable Content Object Reference Model<====>28165<====>Sharable Content Object Reference Model Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) is a collection of standards and specifications for web-based electronic educational technology (also called e-learning).  It defines communications between client side content and a host system (called "the run-time environment"), which is commonly supported by a learning management system.  SCORM also defines how content may be packaged into a transferable ZIP file called "Package Interchange Format. " SCORM is a specification of the Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative from the Office of the United States Secretary of Defense. SCORM 2004 introduced a complex idea called sequencing, which is a set of rules that specifies the order in which a learner may experience content objects. 

Sejm<====>28167<====>Sejm    The Sejm of the Republic of Poland ( ;  ) is the lower house of the Polish parliament.  It consists of 460 deputies (posłowie, literally "envoys", in Polish) elected by universal ballot and is presided over by a speaker called the "Marshal of the Sejm of the Republic of Poland" (Marszałek Sejmu Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej).  In the Kingdom of Poland, "Sejm" referred to the entire three-chamber parliament of Poland, comprising the lower house (the Chamber of Envoys;  ), the upper house (the Senate; Polish: Senat) and the King.  It was thus a three-estate parliament. 

Stock exchange<====>28168<====>Stock exchange   A stock exchange is an exchange (or bourse)The concept of the bourse (or the exchange) was 'invented' in the medieval Low Countries (most notably in predominantly Dutch-speaking cities like Bruges and Antwerp) before the birth of formal stock exchanges in the 17th century.  A pre-VOC bourse was not exactly a formal stock exchange in its modern sense.  With the founding of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in 1602 and the rise of Dutch capital markets in the early 1600s, the 'old' bourse (a place to trade commodities, government and municipal bonds) found a new purpose – a formal exchange that specialize in creating and sustaining secondary markets in the securities (such as bonds and shares of stock) issued by corporations – or a stock exchange as we know it today. 

Son of God<====>28170<====>Son of God  Historically, many rulers have assumed titles such as son of God, son of a god or son of heaven.

Skewness<====>28212<====>Skewness  In probability theory and statistics, skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean.  The skewness value can be positive or negative, or undefined. The qualitative interpretation of the skew is complicated and unintuitive.  Skew does not refer to the direction the curve appears to be leaning; in fact, the opposite is true.  For a unimodal distribution, negative skew indicates that the tail on the left side of the probability density function is longer or fatter than the right side – it does not distinguish these two kinds of shape.

Spontaneous emission<====>28219<====>Spontaneous emission Spontaneous emission is the process in which a quantum mechanical system (such as an atom, molecule or subatomic particle) transitions from an excited energy state to a lower energy state (e. g. , its ground state) and emits a quantum in the form of a photon.  Spontaneous emission is ultimately responsible for most of the light we see all around us; it is so ubiquitous that there are many names given to what is essentially the same process.  If atoms (or molecules) are excited by some means other than heating, the spontaneous emission is called luminescence. 

Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot<====>28220<====>Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot   Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot ( ; 1 June 1796 – 24 August 1832) was a French military engineer and physicist, often described as the "father of thermodynamics".   In his only publication, the 1824 monograph Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire, Carnot gave the first successful theory of the maximum efficiency of heat engines.   Carnot's work attracted little attention during his lifetime, but it was later used by Rudolf Clausius and Lord Kelvin to formalize the second law of thermodynamics and define the concept of entropy.

Star catalogue<====>28232<====>Star catalogueA star catalogue (Commonwealth English) or star catalog (American English), is an astronomical catalogue that lists stars.  In astronomy, many stars are referred to simply by catalogue numbers.  There are a great many different star catalogues which have been produced for different purposes over the years, and this article covers only some of the more frequently quoted ones.  Star catalogues were compiled by many different ancient peoples, including the Babylonians, Greeks, Chinese, Persians, and Arabs.  Most modern catalogues are available in electronic format and can be freely downloaded from space agencies data center. Completeness and accuracy is described by the weakest apparent magnitude V (largest number) and the accuracy of the positions. 

Stellar designation<====>28233<====>Stellar designationDesignations of stars (and other celestial bodies) and their naming is currently primarily mediated in the scientific community by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), a de facto authority.   The IAU states    that it is keen to make a distinction between the terms name and designation.  To the IAU, name refers to the (usually colloquial) term used for a star in everyday speech, while designation is solely alphanumerical and used almost exclusively in official catalogues and for professional astronomy.  Many of the names and some of the designations in use today were inherited from the time before the IAU existed.

Star network<====>28244<====>Star network Star networks are one of the most common computer network topologies.  In its simplest form, a star network consists of one central hub which acts as a conduit to transmit messages.  In star topology, every host is connected to a central hub.   A star network is an implementation of a spoke–hub distribution paradigm in computer networks.   The hub and hosts, and the transmission lines between them, form a graph with the topology of a star.  Data on a star network passes through the hub before continuing to its destination.  The hub manages and controls all functions of the network.

Search algorithm<====>28249<====>Search algorithm In computer science, a search algorithm is any algorithm which solves the Search problem, namely, to retrieve information stored within some data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain.  Examples of such structures include but are not limited to a Linked List, an Array data structure, or a Search tree.  The appropriate search algorithm often depends on the data structure being searched, and may also include prior knowledge about the data.  Searching also encompasses algorithms that query the data structure, such as the SQL SELECT command.   Search algorithms can be classified based on their mechanism of searching. 

Sorcerer (Linux distribution)<====>28250<====>Sorcerer (Linux distribution)  Sorcerer was a source-based Linux distribution.  The distribution downloads and compiles source code to install and update installed software. Instead of using abbreviations such as rpm (Red Hat) and dpkg (Debian), Sorcerer's tool terminology is based upon magic words.  For example, a recipe for downloading, compiling, and installing software is called a "spell".  Software to install is "cast" onto the computer.  Installed software can be removed by "dispelling".  Consequently, the command line tools for casting and dispelling software are called cast and dispel, respectively. HistoryIn 2000, Kyle Sallee created a source-based Linux distribution called Sorcerer GNU/Linux and released it under the GNU GPL. 

Safe semantics<====>28254<====>Safe semantics Safe semantics is a consistency model that describes one type of guarantee a data register provides when it is shared by several processors in a parallel machine or in a network of computers working together. This notion was first defined by Lamport in 1985.   Later on, it was formally defined in Leslie Lamport's "On Interprocess Communication", which was published in Distributed Computing in 1986.  Safe semantics are defined for a variable with a single writer but multiple readers (SWMR).  A SWMR register is safe if each read operation satisfies the two following properties:A read operation not concurrent with any write operation returns the value written by the latest write operation.

" Dictionary. com Unabridged (v 1. 1).  Random House, Inc.  17 Mar.  2009.    Snowboards widths are between 6 to 12 inches or 15 to 30 centimeters.   Snowboards are differentiated from monoskis by the stance of the user.   In monoskiing, the user stands with feet inline with direction of travel (facing tip of monoski/downhill) (parallel to long axis of board), whereas in snowboarding, users stand with feet transverse (more or less) to the longitude of the board. 

Stanza<====>28263<====>Stanza  In poetry, a stanza ( ; from Italian stanza  , "room") is a grouped set of lines within a poem, usually set off from other stanzas by a blank line or indentation.   Stanzas can have regular rhyme and metrical schemes, though stanzas are not strictly required to have either.  There are many unique forms of stanzas.  Some stanzaic forms are simple, such as four-line quatrains.  Other forms are more complex, such as the Spenserian stanza.  Fixed verse poems, such as sestinas, can be defined by the number and form of their stanzas. 

Spanish–American War<====>28265<====>Spanish–American WarThe Spanish–American War (  or  ;  ) was fought between the United States and Spain in 1898.  Hostilities began in the aftermath of the internal explosion of the USS Maine in Havana Harbor in Cuba leading to United States intervention in the Cuban War of Independence.  American acquisition of Spain's Pacific possessions led to its involvement in the Philippine Revolution and ultimately in the Philippine–American War.  Some recent historians prefer a broader title to encompass the fighting in Cuba and the Philippine Islands. examples:The main issue was Cuban independence. 

Scurvy<====>28266<====>Scurvy  Scurvy is a disease resulting from a lack of vitamin C.Early symptoms include weakness, feeling tired, and sore arms and legs.    Without treatment, decreased red blood cells, gum disease, changes to hair, and bleeding from the skin may occur.    As scurvy worsens there can be poor wound healing, personality changes, and finally death from infection or bleeding.   Typically, scurvy is caused by a lack of vitamin C in the diet.   It takes at least a month of little to no vitamin C before symptoms occur. 

Sydney Harbour Bridge<====>28267<====>Sydney Harbour Bridge   The Sydney Harbour Bridge is a steel through arch bridge across Sydney Harbour that carries rail, vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic between the Sydney central business district (CBD) and the North Shore.  The dramatic view of the bridge, the harbour, and the nearby Sydney Opera House is an iconic image of Sydney, and Australia itself.  The bridge is nicknamed "The Coathanger" because of its arch-based design.Under the direction of Dr John Bradfield of the NSW Department of Public Works, the bridge was designed and built by British firm Dorman Long and Co Ltd of Middlesbrough  and opened in 1932. 

Saving Private Ryan<====>28269<====>Saving Private Ryan  Saving Private Ryan is a 1998 American epic war drama film set during the Invasion of Normandy in World War II.  Directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Robert Rodat, the film is notable for its graphic portrayal of war, and for the intensity of its opening 27 minutes, which includes a depiction of the Omaha Beach assault during the Normandy landings.

Shaggy dog story<====>28270<====>Shaggy dog story  In its original sense, a shaggy dog story or yarn is an extremely long-winded anecdote characterized by extensive narration of typically irrelevant incidents and terminated by an anticlimax or a pointless punchline. Shaggy dog stories play upon the audience's preconceptions of joke-telling.  The audience listens to the story with certain expectations, which are either simply not met or met in some entirely unexpected manner.A lengthy shaggy dog story derives its humour from the fact that the joke-teller held the attention of the listeners for a long time (such jokes can take five minutes or more to tell) for no reason at all, as the end resolution is essentially meaningless. 

Sushi<====>28271<====>Sushiis the Japanese preparation and serving of specially prepared   combined with varied   such as chiefly seafood (often uncooked), vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits.  Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the key ingredient is sushi rice, also referred to as  , or  . Sushi can be prepared with either brown or white rice.

Shinto<====>28272<====>Shintoor kami-no-michi (among other names)  is the traditional religion of Japan that focuses on ritual practices to be carried out diligently in order to establish a connection between present-day Japan and its ancient past.  Shinto practices were first recorded and codified in the written historical records of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki in the 8th century.  Still, these earliest Japanese writings do not refer to a unified religion, but rather to a collection of native beliefs and mythology.   Shinto today is the religion of public shrines devoted to the worship of a multitude of gods (kami), Breen, Teeuwen.

A Rite is a progressive series of degrees conferred by various Masonic organizations or bodies, each of which operates under the control of its own central authority.  In the Scottish Rite the central authority is called a Supreme Council. 

Switch<====>28284<====>Switch   In electrical engineering, a switch is an electrical component that can "make" or "break" an electrical circuit, interrupting the current or diverting it from one conductor to another.   The mechanism of a switch removes or restores the conducting path in a circuit when it is operated.  It may be operated manually, for example, a light switch or a keyboard button, may be operated by a moving object such as a door, or may be operated by some sensing element for pressure, temperature or flow.  A switch will have one or more sets of contacts, which may operate simultaneously, sequentially, or alternately. 

Sutra<====>28287<====>Sutra A sutra (IAST: sūtra) is an aphorism or other teaching that is part of the ancient religious traditions originating in South Asia, particularly Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.   Monier Williams, Sanskrit English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, Entry for sutra, page 1241   The term sutra can broadly refer to a single aphorism, a collection of aphorisms in the form of a manual or even a condensed manual or text.   Sutras are considered a genre of ancient and medieval Indian texts.  In Hinduism, sutras are a distinct type of literary composition, a compilation of short aphoristic statements.

According to translator William Scott Wilson: "In Chinese, the character 侍 was originally a verb meaning "to wait upon", "accompany persons" in the upper ranks of society, and this is also true of the original term in Japanese,  .  In both countries the terms were nominalized to mean "those who serve in close attendance to the nobility", the Japanese term   being the nominal form of the verb. 

Slackware<====>28290<====>Slackware  Slackware is a Linux distribution created by Patrick Volkerding in 1993.  Originally based on Softlanding Linux System, Slackware has been the basis for many other Linux distributions, most notably the first versions of SUSE Linux distributions,   and is the oldest distribution that is still maintained.  Slackware aims for design stability and simplicity and to be the most "Unix-like" Linux distribution.It makes as few modifications as possible to software packages from upstream and tries not to anticipate use cases or preclude user decisions.  In contrast to most modern Linux distributions, Slackware provides no graphical installation procedure and no automatic dependency resolution of software packages. 

Short story<====>28296<====>Short storyA short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting.  Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization.  At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a "single effect" or mood.   In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. 

Soul<====>28297<====>Soul  In many religious, philosophical and mythological traditions, there is a belief in the incorporeal essence of a living being called the soul.  Soul or psyche (Greek: "psyühē", of "psychein", "to breathe") are the mental abilities of a living being: reason, character, feeling, consciousness, memory, perception, thinking, etc. Depending on the philosophical system, a soul can either be mortal or immortal.   In Judeo-Christianity, only human beings have immortal souls (although immortality is disputed within Judaism and may have been influenced by Plato,  and in Eastern Orthodox Christianity the soul is said to be immortal by grace, but not nature). 

Steradian<====>28299<====>Steradian The steradian (symbol: sr) or square radian   is the SI unit of solid angle.  It is used in three-dimensional geometry, and is analogous to the radian which quantifies planar angles.  The name is derived from the Greek stereos for "solid" and the Latin radius for "ray, beam". The steradian, like the radian, is a dimensionless unit, essentially because a solid angle is the ratio between the area subtended and the square of its distance from the center: both the numerator and denominator of this ratio have dimension length squared (i. e.  L /L  = 1, dimensionless). 

String theory<====>28305<====>String theory   In physics, string theory is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings.  It describes how these strings propagate through space and interact with each other.  On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string looks just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string.  In string theory, one of the many vibrational states of the string corresponds to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force.  Thus string theory is a theory of quantum gravity. 

Sin<====>28307<====>Sin   In a religious context, sin is the act of transgression against divine law.   Sin can also be viewed as any thought or action that endangers the ideal relationship between an individual and God; or as any diversion from the perceived ideal order for human living.  "To sin" has been defined from a Greek concordance as "to miss the mark".    "Hamartia," The NAS New Testament Greek Lexicon.  Augustine eventually (after the Pelagian controversy) defined sin as a hardened heart, a loss of love for God, a disposition of the heart to depart from God because of inordinate self-love (see Augustine On Grace and Free Will in Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, trans. 

Sonic Youth<====>28309<====>Sonic Youth Sonic Youth were an American rock band based in New York City, formed in 1981.  Founding members Thurston Moore (guitar, vocals), Kim Gordon (bass guitar, vocals, guitar) and Lee Ranaldo (guitar, vocals) remained together for the entire history of the band, while Steve Shelley (drums) followed a series of short-term drummers in 1985, and rounded out the core line-up.  Sonic Youth emerged from the experimental no wave art and music scene in New York before evolving into a more conventional rock band and becoming the most prominent of the American noise rock groups.  Sonic Youth have been praised for having "redefined what rock guitar could do"    using a wide variety of unorthodox guitar tunings and preparing guitars with objects like drum sticks and screwdrivers to alter the instruments' timbre. 

SCSI<====>28313<====>SCSI   Small Computer System Interface (SCSI,    )  is a set of standards for physically connecting and transferring data between computers and peripheral devices.  The SCSI standards define commands, protocols, electrical and optical interfaces.  SCSI is most commonly used for hard disk drives and tape drives, but it can connect a wide range of other devices, including scanners and CD drives, although not all controllers can handle all devices.  The SCSI standard defines command sets for specific peripheral device types; the presence of "unknown" as one of these types means that in theory it can be used as an interface to almost any device, but the standard is highly pragmatic and addressed toward commercial requirements. 

Super Nintendo Entertainment System<====>28314<====>Super Nintendo Entertainment System   The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (officially abbreviated the Super NES  or SNES , and colloquially shortened to Super Nintendo ) is a 16-bit home video game console developed by Nintendo that was released in 1990 in Japan and South Korea, 1991 in North America, 1992 in Europe and Australasia (Oceania), and 1993 in South America.  In Japan, the system is called the Super Famicom , or SFC for short.  In South Korea, it is known as the Super Comboy  and was distributed by Hyundai Electronics.  Although each version is essentially the same, several forms of regional lockout prevent the different versions from being compatible with one another. 

Smalltalk<====>28319<====>Smalltalk  Smalltalk is an object-oriented, dynamically typed, reflective programming language.  Smalltalk was created as the language to underpin the "new world" of computing exemplified by "human–computer symbiosis. "    It was designed and created in part for educational use, more so for constructionist learning, at the Learning Research Group (LRG)  of  Xerox PARC by Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls, Adele Goldberg, Ted Kaehler, Scott Wallace, and others during the 1970s. The language was first generally released as Smalltalk-80.  Smalltalk-like languages are in continuing active development and have gathered loyal communities of users around them. 

Steve Biko<====>28320<====>Steve Biko   Bantu Stephen Biko (18 December 1946 – 12 September 1977) was a South African anti-apartheid activist.  Ideologically an African nationalist and African socialist, he was at the forefront of a grassroots anti-apartheid campaign known as the Black Consciousness Movement during the late 1960s and 1970s.  His ideas were articulated in a series of articles published under the pseudonym Frank Talk.    Raised in a poor Xhosa family, Biko grew up in Ginsberg township in the Eastern Cape.  In 1966, he began studying medicine at the University of Natal, where he joined the National Union of South African Students (NUSAS).

The season was filmed from July 11, 2001 through August 18, 2001 and premiered on October 11, 2001.  Hosted by Jeff Probst, it consisted of the usual 39 days of gameplay with 16 competitors.  It was set in Kenya's Shaba National Reserve on the African continent. The two initial tribes were Boran and Samburu, named for the real-life Borana and Samburu tribes.  After 12 days, three members of each team switched to the other team, in what became known as the first "twist" in the Survivor series. 

Samhain<====>28323<====>Samhain    Samhain ( ;  ) is a Gaelic festival marking the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter or the "darker half" of the year.  Traditionally, it is celebrated from 31 October to 1 November, as the Celtic day began and ended at sunset.  This is about halfway between the autumn equinox and the winter solstice.  It is one of the four Gaelic seasonal festivals, along with Imbolc, Bealtaine and Lughnasadh.  Historically, it was widely observed throughout Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man.  Similar festivals are held at the same time of year in other Celtic lands; for example the Brythonic Calan Gaeaf (in Wales), Kalan Gwav (in Cornwall), and Kalan Goañv (in Brittany). 

Stargate (film)<====>28327<====>Stargate (film)   Stargate is a 1994 science fiction adventure film  released through Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) and Carolco Pictures.  Created by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, the film is the first release in the Stargate franchise.  Directed by Roland Emmerich, the film stars Kurt Russell, James Spader, Jaye Davidson, Alexis Cruz, Mili Avital, and Viveca Lindfors.  The plot centers on the premise of a "Stargate", an ancient ring-shaped device that creates a wormhole enabling travel to a similar device elsewhere in the universe.  The film's central plot explores the theory of extraterrestrial beings having an influence upon human civilization. 

Sigismund<====>28328<====>SigismundSigismund (variants: Sigmund, Siegmund) is a German proper name, meaning "protection through victory", from Old High German sigu "victory" + munt "hand, protection".  Tacitus Latinises it Segimundus.  There appears to be an older form of the High German word "Sieg" (victory): sigis, obviously Gothic and an inferred Germanic form, and there is a younger form: sigi, which is Old Saxon or Old High German sigu (both from about 9th century).  A 5th century Prince of Burgundy was known both as Sigismund and Sigimund (see Ernst Förstemann, Altdeutsche Personennamen, 1906; Henning Kaufmann, Altdeutsche Personennamen, Ergänzungsband,1968). A Lithuanian name Žygimantas, meaning "wealth of (military) campaign", from Lithuanian žygis "campaign, march" + manta "goods, wealth"  has been a substitution of the name Sigismund in the Lithuanian language, from which it was adopted by the Ruthenian language as Жыгімонт (such are the cases of Sigismund Kestutaitis, Sigismund Korybut, Sigismund I the Old, Sigismund II Augustus). 

Solomon<====>28329<====>SolomonSolomon ( ;  , Shlomoh),  also called Jedidiah (Hebrew   Yədidya), was, according to the Hebrew Bible (Book of Kings: 1 Kings 1–11; Book of Chronicles: 1 Chronicles 28–29, 2 Chronicles 1–9), Quran, hadith and Hidden Words,  a fabulously wealthy and wise king of Israel who succeeded his father, King David.The conventional dates of Solomon's reign are circa 970 to 931 BCE, normally given in alignment with the dates of David's reign.  He is described as the third king of the United Monarchy, which would break apart into the northern Kingdom of Israel and the southern Kingdom of Judah shortly after his death. 

Saul<====>28330<====>Saul   Saul ( ;  , meaning "asked for, prayed for";  ;  , Ṭālūt or  , Ša'ūl), according to the Hebrew Bible, was the first king of the Kingdom of Israel and Judah.  His reign, traditionally placed in the late 11th century BCE,  marked a transition from a tribal society to statehood.  Saul's life and reign are described in the Hebrew Bible.  He was anointed by the prophet Samuel and reigned from Gibeah.  He fell on his sword (committing suicide) to avoid capture in the battle against the Philistines at Mount Gilboa, during which three of his sons were also killed. 

Samaria<====>28333<====>Samaria Samaria ( ;   ,  Standard   ,  Tiberian  Šōmərôn;  ,   – also known as  ) is a name for the mountainous, central region of the ancient Eastern Mediterranean,    based on the borders of the biblical Kingdom of Israel, and especially the Israelite tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh.  The name "Samaria" is derived from the ancient city of Samaria, the capital of the northern Kingdom of Israel. Since 1967, Samaria has been used by Israeli officials to refer to the north of the West Bank, as the administrative Judea and Samaria Area. 

Sennacherib<====>28334<====>Sennacherib  Sennacherib (Akkadian: Sîn-ahhī-erība, "Sîn has replaced the brothers";  ;pronounced in Modern Hebrewor in some Mizrahi dialects   ) was the king of Assyria from 705 BCE to 681 BCE.  He is principally remembered for his military campaigns against Babylon and Judah, and for his building programs – most notably at the Akkadian capital of Nineveh.   He was assassinated in obscure circumstances in 681 BCE,  apparently by his eldest son (his designated successor, Esarhaddon, was the youngest).  The primary preoccupation of his reign was the so-called "Babylonian problem", the refusal of the Babylonians to accept Assyrian rule, culminating in his destruction of the city in 689 BCE. 

Saaremaa<====>28338<====>Saaremaa  Saaremaa ( ; Danish: Øsel;  English (esp.  traditionally): Osel;   Finnish: Saarenmaa;  Swedish & German: Ösel) is the largest island in Estonia, measuring  .

Single-shot<====>28340<====>Single-shot Single-shot firearms are firearms that hold only a single round of ammunition, and must be reloaded after each shot.  The history of firearms began with single-shot designs, and many centuries passed before multi-shot repeater designs became commonplace.  Single-shot designs are less complex than revolvers or magazine-fed firearms, and many single-shot designs are still produced by many manufacturers, in both cartridge- and non-cartridge varieties, from zip guns to the highest-quality shooting-match weapons. HistoryPre-cartridge era The vast majority of firearms before the introduction of metallic cartridges in the 1860s were single-shot and muzzle loading.  However, multi-barrel, breech loading, revolving, and other multi-shot firearms had been experimented with for centuries.

Secondary conversion<====>28351<====>Secondary conversion  In the sociology of religion, secondary conversion is the religious conversion of an individual that results from a relationship with another convert, rather than from any particular aspect of the new religion.  For example, someone might join a religious group primarily because their spouse or partner has done so; such a person would be a secondary convert.  Secondary converts are people who join a religion only because of a relationship with the other convert. Secondary conversion can greatly expand a movement's influence,    particularly after a conquest, such as the Muslim Moorish conquest of Spain and Catholic Spain's conquests in Latin America. 

Sociology of religion<====>28352<====>Sociology of religion   Sociology of religion is the study of the beliefs, practices and organizational forms of religion using the tools and methods of the discipline of sociology.  This objective investigation may include the use of both quantitative methods (surveys, polls, demographic and census analysis) and qualitative approaches such as participant observation, interviewing, and analysis of archival, historical and documentary materials.  Modern academic sociology began with the analysis of religion in Émile Durkheim's 1897 study of suicide rates among Catholic and Protestant populations, a foundational work of social research which served to distinguish sociology from other disciplines, such as psychology. 

Samuel<====>28354<====>Samuel  Samuel is a figure in the Hebrew Bible who plays a key role in the narrative, in the transition from the period of the biblical judges to the institution of a kingdom under Saul, and again in the transition from Saul to David.

Symplectic manifold<====>28356<====>Symplectic manifoldIn mathematics, a symplectic manifold is a smooth manifold, M, equipped with a closed nondegenerate differential 2-form, ω, called the symplectic form.  The study of symplectic manifolds is called symplectic geometry or symplectic topology.  Symplectic manifolds arise naturally in abstract formulations of classical mechanics and analytical mechanics as the cotangent bundles of manifolds.  For example, in the Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics, which provides one of the major motivations for the field, the set of all possible configurations of a system is modeled as a manifold, and this manifold's cotangent bundle describes the phase space of the system.

Telephone switchboard<====>28427<====>Telephone switchboard A telephone switchboard is a telecommunications system used in the public switched telephone network or in enterprises to interconnect circuits of telephones to establish telephone calls between the subscribers or users, or between other exchanges.  The switchboard was an essential component of a manual telephone exchange, and was operated by switchboard operators who used electrical cords or switches to establish the connections. The electromechanical automatic telephone exchange, invented by Almon Strowger in 1888, gradually replaced manual switchboards in central telephone exchanges around the world.  In 1919, the Bell System in Canada also adopted automatic switching as its future technology, after years of reliance on manual systems. 

Space exploration<====>28431<====>Space exploration  Space exploration is the ongoing discovery and exploration of celestial structures in outer space by means of continuously evolving and growing space technology.  While the study of space is carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, the physical exploration of space is conducted both by unmanned robotic space probes and human spaceflight. While the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy, predates reliable recorded history, it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the mid-twentieth century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality.  Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries.

Shepherd Neame Brewery<====>28435<====>Shepherd Neame Brewery   Shepherd Neame is an English independent regional brewery founded in 1698 in Faversham, Kent, and family-owned since 1864.   The brewery produces a range of cask ales and filtered beers.  Production is around 210,000 brewers' barrels a year.   It owns 328 pubs and hotels,  predominantly in Kent, London and South East England.  The company exports to more than 35 countries including Sweden, Italy, Brazil and Canada. HistoryThe family of Neame were relative latecomers in the overall development of the Shepherd Neame Brewery but, as substantial property owners in the district, Charles Neame of Harefield Court and John Neame of Selling Court were acknowledged to be among the most valuable hop growers in East Kent. 

Saint<====>28436<====>Saint  A saint (also historically known as a hallow) is a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness or closeness to God.   Depending on the context and denomination, the term also retains its original Christian meaning, as any believer who is "in Christ" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. In Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, and Oriental Orthodox doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation;    official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently veneration, is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church. 

Simple harmonic motion<====>28437<====>Simple harmonic motion In mechanics and physics, simple harmonic motion is a type of periodic motion or oscillation motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement and acts in the direction opposite to that of displacement. Simple harmonic motion can serve as a mathematical model for a variety of motions, such as the oscillation of a spring.  In addition, other phenomena can be approximated by simple harmonic motion, including the motion of a simple pendulum as well as molecular vibration.  Simple harmonic motion is typified by the motion of a mass on a spring when it is subject to the linear elastic restoring force given by Hooke's Law. 

Skyclad (Neopaganism)<====>28438<====>Skyclad (Neopaganism)In Wicca and Paganism/Neo-paganism, the term skyclad is used to refer to ritual nudity.  Some Wiccan groups, or Traditions, perform some or all of their rituals skyclad.   Whilst nudity and the practice of witchcraft have long been associated in the visual arts, this contemporary ritual nudity is typically attributed to either the influence of Gerald Gardner or to a passage from Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches, and as such is mainly attributed to the Gardnerian and Aradian covens. Gardner's Witchcraft Today was published in 1954.  The book claimed to report on the contemporary practice of Pagan religious witchcraft in England, which had supposedly survived as an underground religion for centuries. 

Syracuse, Sicily<====>28441<====>Syracuse, Sicily  Syracuse ( ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  , Syrakousai;    Medieval  ) is a historic city in Sicily, the capital of the province of Syracuse.  The city is notable for its rich Greek history, culture, amphitheatres, architecture, and as the birthplace of the preeminent mathematician and engineer Archimedes.    This 2,700-year-old city played a key role in ancient times, when it was one of the major powers of the Mediterranean world.   Syracuse is located in the southeast corner of the island of Sicily, next to the Gulf of Syracuse beside the Ionian Sea. 

Sorting algorithm<====>28442<====>Sorting algorithmIn computer science,  a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list in a certain order.  The most-used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order.  Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the use of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) which require input data to be in sorted lists; it is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output.  More formally, the output must satisfy two conditions:The output is in nondecreasing order (each element is no smaller than the previous element according to the desired total order);The output is a permutation (reordering but with all of the original elements) of the input. 

Syracuse, New York<====>28443<====>Syracuse, New York  {{Infobox settlement }}Syracuse ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Onondaga County, New York, in the United States.  It is the largest U. S.  city with the name "Syracuse", and is the fifth most populous city in the state of New York following New York City, Buffalo, Rochester, and Yonkers.  At the 2010 census, the city population was 145,252, and its metropolitan area had a population of 662,577.  It is the economic and educational hub of Central New York, a region with over one million inhabitants.  Syracuse is also well-provided with convention sites, with a downtown convention complex. 

Sleep apnea<====>28445<====>Sleep apnea  Sleep apnea, also spelled sleep apnoea, is a sleep disorder characterized by pauses in breathing or periods of shallow breathing during sleep.   Each pause can last for a few seconds to a few minutes and they happen many times a night.   In the most common form, this follows loud snoring.There may be a choking or snorting sound as breathing resumes.   As it disrupts normal sleep, those affected may experience sleepiness or feel tired during the day.In children it may cause problems in school or hyperactivity. 

South African English<====>28447<====>South African English    South African English (SAfrE, SAfrEng, SAE, en-ZA ) is the set of English dialects spoken by native South Africans.  There is considerable social and regional variation within South African English.  Like Australian English, three variants (termed "The Great Trichotomy" by Roger Lass)  are commonly identified within White South African English, spoken primarily by White South Africans: "Cultivated", closely approximating England's standard Received Pronunciation and associated with the upper class; "General", a social indicator of the middle class; and "Broad", associated with the working class, and closely approximating the second-language Afrikaner variety called Afrikaans English. 

Speech processing<====>28448<====>Speech processing Speech processing is the study of speech signals and the processing methods of these signals. The signals are usually processed in a digital representation, so speech processing can be regarded as a special case of digital signal processing, applied to speech signal. Aspects of speech processing includes the acquisition, manipulation, storage, transfer and output of speech signals. The input is called speech recognition and the output is called speech synthesis.See alsoSpeech codingSpeech technology 

Swahili language<====>28450<====>Swahili language Swahili, also known as Kiswahili (translation: coast language ), is a Bantu language and the first language of the Swahili people.  It is a lingua franca of the African Great Lakes region and other parts of eastern and south-eastern Africa, including Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Mozambique, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).   Comorian, spoken in the Comoros Islands is sometimes considered to be a dialect of Swahili, though other authorities consider it a distinct language.  Estimates of the total number of Swahili speakers vary widely, from 50 million to over 100 million. 

Summary offence<====>28452<====>Summary offenceA summary offence is a crime in some common law jurisdictions that can be proceeded against summarily, without the right to a jury trial and/or indictment (required for an indictable offence). CanadaIn Canada, summary offences are referred to as summary conviction offences.    As in other jurisdictions, summary conviction offences are considered less serious than indictable offences because they are punishable by shorter prison sentences and smaller fines.  These offences appear both in the federal laws of Canada and in the legislation of Canada's provinces and territories.   For summary conviction offences that fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government (which includes all criminal law), section 787 of the Criminal Code specifies that, unless another punishment is provided for by law, the maximum penalty for a summary conviction offence is a sentence of 6 months of imprisonment, a fine of $5,000 or both. 

Szczecin<====>28456<====>Szczecin  Szczecin ( ;  ; German and  ,  known also by other alternative names) is the capital and largest city of the West Pomeranian Voivodeship in Poland.  Located near the Baltic Sea and the German border, it is a major seaport and Poland's seventh-largest city.  As of June 2011, the population was 407,811.  Szczecin is located on the Oder, south of the Szczecin Lagoon and the Bay of Pomerania.  The city is situated along the southwestern shore of Dąbie Lake, on both sides of the Oder and on several large islands between the western and eastern branches of the river. 

Sudbury Neutrino Observatory<====>28462<====>Sudbury Neutrino Observatory The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) was a neutrino observatory located 2100 m underground in Vale's  Creighton Mine in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.  The detector was designed to detect solar neutrinos through their interactions with a large tank of heavy water. The detector was turned on in May 1999, and was turned off on 28 November 2006.   The SNO collaboration was active for several years after that analyzing the data taken. The director of the experiment, Art McDonald, was co-awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2015 for the experiment's contribution to the discovery of neutrino oscillation. 

Super-Kamiokande<====>28464<====>Super-Kamiokande   Super-Kamiokande (semi-abbreviation of full name: Super-Kamioka Neutrino Detection Experiment, also abbreviated to Super-K or SK;  ) is a neutrino observatory located under Mount Ikeno near the city of Hida, Gifu Prefecture, Japan.  it is located   underground in the Mozumi Mine in the Hida's Kamioka area.  The observatory was designed to detect high-energy neutrinos to search for proton decay, study solar and atmospheric neutrinos, and keep watch for supernovae in the Milky Way Galaxy. It consists of a cylindrical stainless steel tank about   in height and diameter holding 50,000 tons of ultrapure water. 

Stimulated emission<====>28469<====>Stimulated emissionStimulated emission is the process by which an incoming photon of a specific frequency can interact with an excited atomic electron (or other excited molecular state), causing it to drop to a lower energy level.  The liberated energy transfers to the electromagnetic field, creating a new photon with a phase, frequency, polarization, and direction of travel that are all identical to the photons of the incident wave.  This is in contrast to spontaneous emission, which occurs at random intervals  without regard to the ambient electromagnetic field. The process is identical in form to atomic absorption in which the energy of an absorbed photon causes an identical but opposite atomic transition: from the lower level to a higher energy level. 

Siberian Husky<====>28475<====>Siberian Husky The Siberian Husky (Russian: Сибирский хаски) is a medium size working dog breed that originated in north-eastern Siberia, Russia.  "Get to Know the Siberian Husky", 'The American Kennel Club', Retrieved 29 May 2014  The breed belongs to the Spitz genetic family.It is recognizable by its thickly furred double coat, erect triangular ears, and distinctive markings. The original Siberian Huskies were bred by the Chukchi people   whose hunter-gatherer culture relied on their help.  It is an active, energetic, resilient breed, whose ancestors lived in the extremely cold and harsh environment of the Siberian Arctic. 

Skiing<====>28478<====>Skiing   Skiing can be a means of transport, a recreational activity or a competitive winter sport in which the participant uses skis to glide on snow.  Many types of competitive skiing events are recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the International Ski Federation (FIS).  History Skiing has a history of almost five millennia.   Although modern skiing has evolved from beginnings in Scandinavia, it may have been practiced more than 100 centuries ago in what is now China, according to an interpretation of ancient paintings.The word "ski" is one of a handful of words Norway has exported to the international community. 

Spice Girls<====>28480<====>Spice Girls    The Spice Girls were an English pop girl group formed in 1994.  The group originally consisted of Melanie Brown ("Scary Spice"), Melanie Chisholm ("Sporty Spice"), Emma Bunton ("Baby Spice"), Geri Halliwell ("Ginger Spice"), and Victoria Beckham, née Adams ("Posh Spice").  They were signed to Virgin Records and released their debut single "Wannabe" in 1996, which hit number one in 37 countries  and established them as a global phenomenon.  Their debut album Spice sold more than 31 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by a female group in history. 

Statistical mechanics<====>28481<====>Statistical mechanics Statistical mechanics is a branch of theoretical physics that uses probability theory to study the average behaviour of a mechanical system whose exact state is uncertain.The term statistical mechanics is sometimes used to refer to only statistical thermodynamics.  This article takes the broader view.  By some definitions, statistical physics is an even broader term which statistically studies any type of physical system, but is often taken to be synonymous with statistical mechanics.  Statistical mechanics is commonly used to explain the thermodynamic behaviour of large systems.  This branch of statistical mechanics, which treats and extends classical thermodynamics, is known as statistical thermodynamics or equilibrium statistical mechanics. 

Solstice<====>28483<====>Solstice    A solstice is an event occurring when the Sun appears to reach its most northerly or southerly excursion relative to the celestial equator on the celestial sphere.  Two solstices occur annually, on about 21 June and 21 December.  The seasons of the year are directly connected to both the solstices and the equinoxes. The term solstice can also be used in a broader sense, as the day when this occurs.  The day of the solstice in either hemisphere has either the most sunlight of the year (summer solstice) or the least sunlight of the year (winter solstice) for any place other than the Equator. 

Sputnik 1<====>28484<====>Sputnik 1   Sputnik 1  (  or  ; "Satellite-1", or "PS-1", Простейший Спутник-1 or Prosteyshiy Sputnik-1, "Elementary Satellite 1")  was the first artificial Earth satellite.  The Soviet Union launched it into an elliptical low Earth orbit on 4 October 1957.  It was a 58 cm (23 in) diameter polished metal sphere, with four external radio antennas to broadcast radio pulses.  Its  radio signal was easily detectable even by radio amateurs,  and the 65° inclination and duration of its orbit made its flight path cover virtually the entire inhabited Earth.  This surprise success precipitated the American Sputnik crisis and triggered the Space Race, a part of the Cold War. 

Steve Jackson Games<====>28485<====>Steve Jackson Games  Steve Jackson Games (SJGames) is a game company, founded in 1980 by Steve Jackson, that creates and publishes role-playing, board, and card games, and the gaming magazine Pyramid. HistoryFounded in 1980, six years after the birth of Dungeons & Dragons, and before the height of role-playing games, SJGames created several role-playing and strategy games with science fiction themes.   SJGames borrowed and expanded upon ideas pioneered by strategy game companies such as Metagaming Concepts, Avalon Hill and TSR.   SJGames' early titles were all microgames initially sold in 4×7 inch ziploc bags, and later in the similarly sized Pocket Box. 

Stella Artois<====>28486<====>Stella Artois  Stella Artois ( ,  ) is a Belgian pilsner  of between 4. 8 and 5. 2% ABV which was first brewed by Brouwerij Artois (the Artois Brewery) in Leuven, Belgium, in 1926.  Since 2008, a 4% ABV version is also sold in Britain, Ireland, Canada and New Zealand.Stella Artois is now owned by Interbrew International B. V.  which is a subsidiary of the world's largest brewer, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV.  HistoryIn 1708, Sébastien Artois became head brewer at the Den Hoorn brewery in Leuven, a brewery established in 1366. 

Suebi<====>28487<====>SuebiThe Suebi (or Suevi, Suavi, or Suevians) were a large group of tribes who lived in Germania in the time of the Roman Empire.  They were first mentioned by Julius Caesar in connection with his battles against Ariovistus in Gaul, around 58 BC.While Caesar treated them as one Germanic tribe within an alliance, but the largest and most warlike one, later authors, such as Tacitus, Pliny the Elder and Strabo, specified that the Suevi "do not, like the Chatti or Tencteri, constitute a single nation.  They actually occupy more than half of Germania, and are divided into a number of distinct tribes under distinct names, though all generally are called Suebi". 

September 8<====>28488<====>September 8Events617 – Battle of Huoyi: Li Yuan defeats a Sui dynasty army, opening the path to his capture of the imperial capital Chang'an and the eventual establishment of the Tang dynasty. 1100 – Election of Antipope Theodoric. 1198 – Philip of Swabia, Prince of Hohenstaufen, is crowned King of Germany (King of the Romans)1253 – Pope Innocent IV canonised Stanislaus of Szczepanów, killed by king Bolesław II. 1264 – The Statute of Kalisz, guaranteeing Jews safety and personal liberties and giving battei din jurisdiction over Jewish matters, is promulgated by Bolesław the Pious, Duke of Greater Poland. 

Ski<====>28489<====>Ski   A ski is a narrow strip of semi-rigid material worn underfoot to glide over snow.   Substantially longer than wide and characteristically employed in pairs, skis are attached to ski boots with ski bindings, with either a free, lockable, or partially secured heel.  For climbing slopes, ski skins (originally made of seal fur, but now made of synthetic materials) can be attached at the base of the ski. Originally intended as an aid to travel over snow, they are now mainly used recreationally in the sport of skiing.  Etymology and usageThe word ski comes from the Old Norse word "skíð" which means stick of wood or ski. 

Swedish cuisine<====>28490<====>Swedish cuisine Swedish cuisine is the traditional food of the people of Sweden.  Due to Sweden's large North–South expanse, there are regional differences between the cuisine of North and South Sweden.  Historically, in the far North, meats such as reindeer, and other (semi-) game dishes were eaten, some of which have their roots in the Sami culture, while fresh vegetables have played a larger role in the South.  Many traditional dishes employ simple, contrasting flavours, such as the traditional dish of meatballs and brown cream sauce with tart, pungent lingonberry jam (slightly similar in taste to cranberry sauce). 

Submachine gun<====>28491<====>Submachine gun A submachine gun (SMG) is a magazine-fed, fully automatic carbine designed to fire pistol cartridges.  The term "submachine gun" was coined by John T.  Thompson, the inventor of the Thompson submachine gun.  The submachine gun was developed during World War I (1914–1918).  At its zenith during World War II (1939–1945), millions of SMGs were made.  After the war, new SMG designs appeared frequently.  Military Small Arms Of The 20th Century.  Ian Hogg & John Weeks.  Krause Publications.  2000.  p93  However, by the 1980s, SMG usage decreased.   Today, submachine guns have been largely replaced by assault rifles,  which have a greater effective range and are capable of penetrating the helmets and body armor used by modern infantry. 

Squirrel<====>28492<====>SquirrelSquirrels are members of the family Sciuridae, a family that includes small or medium-size rodents.  The squirrel family includes tree squirrels, ground squirrels, chipmunks, marmots (including woodchucks), flying squirrels, and prairie dogs amongst other rodents.   Squirrels are indigenous to the Americas, Eurasia, and Africa, and were introduced by humans to Australia. The earliest known squirrels date from the Eocene period and are most closely related to the mountain beaver and to the dormouse among other living rodent families. EtymologyThat word "squirrel", first attested in 1327, comes from the Anglo-Norman esquirel which is from the Old French escurel, the reflex of a Latin word sciurus. 

Shooting<====>28495<====>Shooting Shooting is the act or process of discharging projectiles from a ranged weapon such as guns, bows or crossbows and slingshots.   Even the discharging/launching of artillery, darts, grenades, rockets and guided missiles can be called shooting.   When using a firearm, the act of shooting is often called firing. Shooting can take place in a shooting range or in the field, in shooting sports, hunting or in combat.   A person who is involved in the shooting activity is a shooter, and those proficient in shooting is called a marksman or sharpshooter.   The level of a person's shooting skills is referred to as marksmanship. 

Shooting sports<====>28498<====>Shooting sports Shooting sports is a collective group of competitive and recreational sporting activities involving proficiency tests of accuracy, precision and speed in using various types of ranged weapons, mainly referring to man-portable guns (firearms and airguns, in forms such as handguns,  rifles  and shotguns ) and bows/crossbows.   Different disciplines of shooting sports can be categorized by equipment, shooting distances, targets, time limits and degrees of athleticism involved.  Shooting sports may involve both team and individual competition, and team performance is usually assessed by summing the scores of the individual team members.   Due to the noise  of shooting and the high (and often lethal) impact energy of the projectiles, shooting sports are typically conducted at either designated permanent shooting ranges  or temporary shooting fields in the area away from settlements. 

Sake<====>28500<====>Sake, also spelled saké, (    or American English    )   also referred to as a Japanese rice wine, is made by fermenting rice that has been polished to remove the bran.  Unlike wine, in which alcohol is produced by fermenting sugar that is naturally present in fruit, typically grapes, sake is produced by a brewing process more akin to that of beer, where starch is converted into sugars which ferment into alcohol. The brewing process for sake differs from the process for beer in that, for beer, the conversion from starch to sugar and from sugar to alcohol occurs in two distinct steps. 

Scuba set<====>28502<====>Scuba set    A scuba set is any breathing apparatus that is carried entirely by an underwater diver and provides the diver with breathing gas at the ambient pressure.  (Scuba is an anacronym  for self-contained underwater breathing apparatus. ) Although strictly speaking the scuba set is only the diving equipment which is required for providing breathing gas to the diver, general usage includes the harness by which it is carried, and those accessories which are integral parts of the harness and breathing apparatus assembly, such as a jacket or wing style buoyancy compensator and instruments mounted in a combined housing with the pressure gauge, and in the looser sense it has been used to refer to any diving equipment used by the scuba diver, though this would more commonly and accurately be termed scuba equipment. 

Subtractive synthesis<====>28503<====>Subtractive synthesis Subtractive synthesis is a method of sound synthesis in which partials of an audio signal (often one rich in harmonics) are attenuated by a filter to alter the timbre of the sound.  While subtractive synthesis can be applied to any source audio signal, the sound most commonly associated with the technique is that of analog synthesizers of the 1960s and 1970s, in which the harmonics of simple waveforms such as sawtooth, pulse or square waves are attenuated with a voltage-controlled resonant low-pass filter.  Many digital, virtual analog and software synthesizers use subtractive synthesis, sometimes in conjunction with other methods of sound synthesis. 

San Diego<====>28504<====>San Diego{{Infobox settlement }}San Diego ( ; Spanish for "Saint Didacus"; Spanish:  ) is a major city in California, United States.  It is in San Diego County, on the coast of the Pacific Ocean in Southern California, approximately   south of Los Angeles and immediately adjacent to the border with Mexico. With an estimated population of 1,406,630 as of July 1, 2016,  San Diego is the eighth-largest city in the United States and second-largest in California.  It is part of the San Diego–Tijuana conurbation, the second-largest transborder agglomeration between the US and a bordering country after Detroit–Windsor, with a population of 4,922,723 people. 

Spacecraft propulsion<====>28506<====>Spacecraft propulsionSpacecraft propulsion is any method used to accelerate spacecraft and artificial satellites.  There are many different methods.  Each method has drawbacks and advantages, and spacecraft propulsion is an active area of research.  However, most spacecraft today are propelled by forcing a gas from the back/rear of the vehicle at very high speed through a supersonic de Laval nozzle.  This sort of engine is called a rocket engine. All current spacecraft use chemical rockets (bipropellant or solid-fuel) for launch, though some (such as the Pegasus rocket and SpaceShipOne) have used air-breathing engines on their first stage. 

Second-order predicate<====>28510<====>Second-order predicateIn mathematical logic, a second-order predicate is a predicate that takes a first-order predicate as an argument.   Compare higher-order predicate. The idea of second order predication was introduced by the German mathematician and philosopher Frege.  It is based on his idea that a predicate such as "is a philosopher" designates a concept, rather than an object.   Sometimes a concept can itself be the subject of a proposition, such as in "There are no Bosnian philosophers".  In this case, we are not saying anything of any Bosnian philosophers, but of the concept "is a Bosnian philosopher" that it is not satisfied. 

Beer in Sweden<====>28512<====>Beer in SwedenBeer in Sweden has a history that can be traced to the late Iron Age. History  Ale brewing has a long history in Sweden, predating written records.  It is known, through old writings such as Hávamál and others, that the Norse culture used brewing to produce ale and mead.  Mead was preferred and ale was the most common.  Scandinavians also had access to wine and beer.  Modern reproductions of Norse brews have been known to produce ale as strong as 9 percent ABV.    Up until the 19th century brewing was mostly a matter of production for household needs. 

Shining Path<====>28521<====>Shining Path  The Communist Party of Peru ( ), more commonly known as the Shining Path ( ), is a communist militant group in Peru.  When it first launched the internal conflict in Peru in 1980, its stated goal was to replace the bourgeois democracy with "New Democracy".  The Shining Path believed that by establishing a dictatorship of the proletariat, inducing cultural revolution, and eventually sparking world revolution, they could arrive at pure communism.  Their representatives stated that existing socialist countries were revisionist, and that the Shining Path were the vanguard of the world communist movement. 

St Albans<====>28523<====>St Albans    St Albans  ,   is a city in Hertfordshire, England, and the major urban area in the City and District of St Albans.  It lies east of Hemel Hempstead and west of Hatfield, about   north-northwest of central London,   southwest of Welwyn Garden City and   south-southeast of Luton.  St Albans was the first major town on the old Roman road of Watling Street for travellers heading north, and it became the Roman city of Verulamium.  It is a historic market town and is now a dormitory town within the London commuter belt and the Greater London Built-up Area. 

RNA splicing<====>28524<====>RNA splicing In molecular biology, splicing is the editing of the nascent precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) transcript into a mature messenger RNA (mRNA).  After splicing, introns are removed and exons are joined together (ligated).  For nuclear-encoded genes, splicing takes place within the nucleus either during or immediately after transcription.  For those eukaryotic genes that contain introns, splicing is usually required in order to create an mRNA molecule that can be translated into protein.   For many eukaryotic introns, splicing is carried out in a series of reactions which are catalyzed by the spliceosome, a complex of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). 

Simon Fraser University<====>28525<====>Simon Fraser University  Simon Fraser University, commonly referred to as SFU, is a public research university in British Columbia, Canada with campuses in Burnaby (Main Campus), Surrey, and Vancouver. The   Burnaby campus on Burnaby Mountain, located   from downtown Vancouver, was established in 1965 and comprises more than 30,000 students and approximately 950 faculty members.  Undergraduate and graduate programs at SFU operate on a year-round tri-semester schedule  and it is the only Canadian university competing in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).  SFU is the first Canadian research university with U. S.  accreditation  and is accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities. 

Skírnir<====>28526<====>SkírnirIn Norse mythology, Skírnir (Old Norse "bright one" Orchard (1997:149).  ) is the god Freyr's messenger and vassal.  In the Poetic Edda poem Skírnismál, Skírnir is sent as a messenger to Jötunheimr to conduct Freyr's wooing of the fair Gerðr on condition of being given Freyr's sword as a reward.  Skírnir also threatens Gerðr with his gambantein, a magic wand.  In chapter 34 of the Prose Edda poem Gylfaginning, Skírnir is also sent to dwarfs in order to have them to make the restraint Gleipnir for the purpose of binding the wolf Fenrir. Notes ReferencesOrchard, Andy (1997). 

Suprême sauce<====>28528<====>Suprême sauce Suprême sauce is one of the classic "small sauces" of French cuisine, that is, one made by combining a basic or mother sauce with extra ingredients. RecipesTraditionally, this sauce is made from a velouté sauce (a roux sauce made with a meat stock - in the case of suprême, a chicken stock is usually preferred), reduced with heavy cream or crème fraîche, and then strained through a fine sieve.  This is the recipe as used in Larousse Gastronomique, a seminal work of French haute cuisine, first published in 1938. A light squeeze of lemon juice is commonly added.

Solar wind<====>28538<====>Solar wind The solar wind is a stream of charged particles released from the upper atmosphere of the Sun, called the corona.  This plasma consists of mostly electrons, protons and alpha particles with thermal energy between 1. 5 and 10 keV.  Embedded within the solar-wind plasma is the interplanetary magnetic field.   The solar wind varies in density, temperature and speed over time and over solar latitude and longitude.  Its particles can escape the Sun's gravity because of their high energy resulting from the high temperature of the corona, which in turn is a result of the coronal magnetic field. 

Spoonerism<====>28543<====>Spoonerism  A spoonerism is an error in speech in which corresponding consonants, vowels, or morphemes are switched (see metathesis) between two words in a phrase. These are named after the Oxford don and ordained minister William Archibald Spooner, who was famous for doing this. An example is saying "The Lord is a shoving leopard" instead of "The Lord is a loving shepherd. " While spoonerisms are commonly heard as slips of the tongue, and getting one's words in a tangle, they can also be used intentionally as a play on words. EtymologyIt is named after the Reverend William Archibald Spooner (1844–1930), Warden of New College, Oxford, who was notoriously prone to this mistake.

Self-reference<====>28545<====>Self-reference   Self-reference occurs in natural or formal languages when a sentence, idea or formula refers to itself.  The reference may be expressed either directly—through some intermediate sentence or formula—or by means of some encoding.  In philosophy, it also refers to the ability of a subject to speak of or refer to itself: to have the kind of thought expressed by the first person nominative singular pronoun, the word "I" in English. Self-reference is studied and has applications in mathematics, philosophy, computer programming, and linguistics.  Self-referential statements are sometimes paradoxical, and can also be considered recursive. 

Sokal affair<====>28547<====>Sokal affair  The Sokal affair, also called the Sokal hoax, Derrida (1997)  was a scholarly publishing hoax perpetrated by Alan Sokal, a physics professor at New York University and University College London.  In 1996, Sokal submitted an article to Social Text, an academic journal of postmodern cultural studies.  The submission was an experiment to test the journal's intellectual rigor and, specifically, to investigate whether "a leading North American journal of cultural studies – whose editorial collective includes such luminaries as Fredric Jameson and Andrew Ross – [would] publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions". 

Sweet tea<====>28551<====>Sweet tea Sweet tea is a style of iced tea commonly consumed in the United States,  especially the Southern United States.  Sweet tea is made by adding sugar to bags of black tea brewing in hot water while the mixture is still hot .  The tea is traditionally served ice-cold with only sugar.   It may sometimes be flavored, usually with raspberry, lemon,  or mint.   Sweet tea can also be made with a simple syrup   and is sometimes tempered with baking soda to reduce the drink's acidity. 

Cuisine of the Southern United States<====>28553<====>Cuisine of the Southern United States   The cuisine of the Southern United States developed in the traditionally defined American South, influenced by African, English, Scottish, Irish, French,  and Native American cuisines.  Tidewater, Appalachian, Creole, Lowcountry, and Floribbean are examples of types of Southern cuisine.  In recent history, elements of Southern cuisine have spread north, having an effect on the development of other types of American cuisine. Many elements of Southern cooking—squash, corn (and its derivatives, including grits), and deep-pit barbecuing—are borrowings from southeast American Indian tribes such as the Caddo, Choctaw, and Seminole.  Sugar, flour, milk, and eggs come from Europe; the Southern fondness for fried foods is Scottish, and the old-fashioned Virginian use of ragouts comes from the West Country of England. 

Second Coming<====>28554<====>Second Coming   The Second Coming (sometimes called the Second Advent or the Parousia) is a Christian and Islamic belief regarding the future return of Jesus Christ after his incarnation and ascension to heaven about two thousand years ago.  The idea is based on messianic prophecies found in the canonical gospels and is part of most Christian eschatologies.  Views about the nature of Jesus' Second Coming vary among Christian denominations and among individual Christians. Most English versions of the Nicene Creed include the following statements:". . . he ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. 

Serialization<====>28555<====>Serialization  In computer science, in the context of data storage, serialization is the process of translating data structures or object state into a format that can be stored (for example, in a file or memory buffer) or transmitted (for example, across a network connection link) and reconstructed later (possibly in a different computer environment).   When the resulting series of bits is reread according to the serialization format, it can be used to create a semantically identical clone of the original object.  For many complex objects, such as those that make extensive use of references, this process is not straightforward. 

Separation of powers<====>28561<====>Separation of powers   The separation of powers, often imprecisely and metonymically used interchangeably with the trias politica principle, is a model for the governance of a state.  Under this model, a state's government is divided into branches, each with separate and independent powers and areas of responsibility so that the powers of one branch are not in conflict with the powers associated with the other branches.  The typical division is into three branches: a legislature, an executive, and a judiciary, which is the trias politica model.   It can be contrasted with the fusion of powers in some parliamentary systems where the executive and legislature are unified. 

Second Punic War<====>28563<====>Second Punic WarThe Second Punic War, also referred to as The Hannibalic War and (by the Romans) the War Against Hannibal   was a global war that lasted from 218 to 201 BC  and involved great powers in the western and eastern Mediterranean.  It was the second major war between Carthage and the Roman Republic and its allied Italic socii, with the participation of Greek polities and Numidian and Iberian forces on both sides. The Second Punic War is one of the deadliest human conflicts.  It was regarded by ancient historians as the greatest war in history, waged with unparalleled resources, skill and hatred. 

Stuttgart<====>28565<====>Stuttgart  Stuttgart (   ;   ; Swabian:  ,  ; names in other languages) is the capital and largest city of the German state of Baden-Württemberg.  Stuttgart is located on the Neckar river in a fertile valley locally known as the "Stuttgart Cauldron" an hour from the Swabian Jura and the Black Forest, and its urban area has a population of 609,219,  making it the sixth largest city in Germany.   2. 7 million people live in the city's administrative region  and another 5. 3 million people in its metropolitan area,  making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Germany. 

Self-propelled artillery<====>28566<====>Self-propelled artillery  Self-propelled artillery (also called mobile artillery or locomotive artillery) is artillery equipped with its own propulsion system to move towards its target.  Within the term are covered self-propelled guns (or howitzers) and rocket artillery.  They are high mobility vehicles, usually based on continuous tracks carrying either a large howitzer, field gun, a mortar or some form of rocket or missile launcher.  They are usually used for long-range indirect bombardment support on the battlefield. In the past, self-propelled artillery has included direct-fire vehicles, such as assault guns and tank destroyers.  These have been heavily armoured vehicles, the former providing close fire-support for infantry and the latter acting as specialized anti-tank vehicles. 

Sinatra Doctrine<====>28568<====>Sinatra Doctrine "Sinatra Doctrine" was the name that the Soviet government of Mikhail Gorbachev used jokingly to describe its policy of allowing neighboring Warsaw Pact states to determine their own internal affairs.  The name alluded to the song "My Way" popularized by Frank Sinatra—the Soviet Union was allowing these states to go their own way. HistoryThe Sinatra Doctrine was a major break with the earlier Brezhnev Doctrine, under which the internal affairs of satellite states were tightly controlled by Moscow.  This had been used to justify the crushing of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, as well as the invasion of the non-Warsaw Pact nation of Afghanistan in 1979. 

Simplified molecular-input line-entry system<====>28569<====>Simplified molecular-input line-entry system  The simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) is a specification in form of a line notation for describing the structure of chemical species using short ASCII strings.  SMILES strings can be imported by most molecule editors for conversion back into two-dimensional drawings or three-dimensional models of the molecules. The original SMILES specification was initiated in the 1980s.  It has since been modified and extended.  In 2007, an open standard called "OpenSMILES" was developed in the open-source chemistry community.   Other 'linear' notations include the Wiswesser Line Notation (WLN), ROSDAL and SLN. HistoryThe original SMILES specification was initiated by David Weininger at the USEPA Mid-Continent Ecology Division Laboratory in Duluth in the 1980s. 

Soweto<====>28573<====>Soweto Soweto (   ) is a township of the city of Johannesburg in Gauteng, South Africa, bordering the city's mining belt in the south.  Its name is an English syllabic abbreviation for South Western Townships.   Formerly a separate municipality, it is now incorporated in the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality, Suburbs of Johannesburg. HistoryGeorge Harrison is today credited as the man who discovered an outcrop of the Main Reef of gold on the farm Langlaagte in February 1886.   The fledgling town of Johannesburg was laid out on a triangular wedge of "uitvalgrond" (area excluded when the farms were surveyed) named Randjeslaagte, situated between the farms Doornfontein to the east, Braamfontein to the west and Turffontein to the south. 

Sampo<====>28575<====>Sampo In Finnish mythology, the Sampo or Sammas was a magical artifact of indeterminate type constructed by Ilmarinen that brought riches and good fortune to its holder.   When the Sampo was stolen, it is said that Ilmarinen's homeland fell upon hard times and he sent an expedition to retrieve it, but in the ensuing battle it was smashed and lost at sea. The Sampo has been interpreted in many ways: a world pillar or world tree, a compass or astrolabe, a chest containing a treasure, a Byzantine coin die, a decorated Vendel period shield, a Christian relic, etc. 

Sysop<====>28576<====>Sysop  A sysop ( ; an abbreviation of system operator) is an administrator of a multi-user computer system, such as a bulletin board system (BBS) or an online service virtual community.

Springbok<====>28580<====>SpringbokThe springbok ( ; Antidorcas marsupialis) is a medium-sized antelope found mainly in southern and southwestern Africa.  The sole member of the genus Antidorcas, this bovid was first described by the German zoologist Eberhard August Wilhelm von Zimmermann in 1780.  Three subspecies are identified.  A slender, long-legged antelope, the springbok reaches   at the shoulder and weighs between  .  Both sexes have a pair of black,   long horns that curve backwards.  The springbok is characterised by a white face, a dark stripe running from the eyes to the mouth, a light-brown coat marked by a reddish-brown stripe that runs from the upper fore leg to the buttocks across the flanks, and a white rump flap. 

Song of Songs<====>28582<====>Song of Songs    The Song of Songs (Hebrew:  , Šīr HašŠīrīm ; Greek:  , Âisma Aismátōn), also known as the Song of Solomon,  Canticles,   or the Canticle of Canticles,  is one of the "scrolls" (megillot) of the Writings (Ketuvim), the last section of the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible.  It is also the fifth book of Wisdom in the Old Testament of the Christian Bible.   In Sephardic Jewish tradition, the Song of Songs is read every Friday night for the divine loving union they see in it; Ashkenazim chant it on the Sabbath during Passover, marking the beginning of the grain harvest and commemorating the Exodus from Egypt. 

Sheridan Le Fanu<====>28584<====>Sheridan Le Fanu   Joseph Thomas Sheridan Le Fanu ( ;28 August 1814 – 7 February 1873) was an Irish writer of Gothic tales and mystery novels.  He was a leading ghost story writer of the nineteenth century and was central to the development of the genre in the Victorian era.  Sullivan, Jack, "Le Fanu, Sheridan".  In Sullivan, ed. , The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural.  New York: Viking.  pp.  257–62.M.  R.  James described Le Fanu as "absolutely in the first rank as a writer of ghost stories". 

Star Chamber<====>28587<====>Star Chamber  The Star Chamber (Latin: Camera stellata) was an English court of law which sat at the royal Palace of Westminster, from the late 15th century to the mid-17th century (c.  1641), and was composed of Privy Councillors and common-law judges, to supplement the judicial activities of the common-law and equity courts in civil and criminal matters.  The Star Chamber was originally established to ensure the fair enforcement of laws against socially and politically prominent people so powerful that ordinary courts would probably hesitate to convict them of their crimes.  However, it became synonymous with social and political oppression through the arbitrary use and abuse of the power it wielded. 

Coat of arms of South Africa<====>28588<====>Coat of arms of South Africa    The present coat of arms of South Africa was introduced on Freedom Day 27 April 2000.   It replaced the earlier national arms, which had been in use since 1910.  Brownell, F. G.  (1993).   National and Provincial Symbols  The motto   is written in the Khoisan language of the ǀXam people and translates literally to "diverse people unite".   The previous motto, in Latin, was  , translated as "From unity, strength". HistoryThe design process was initiated when, in 1999, the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology requested ideas for the new coat-of-arms from the public. 

Second Epistle to the Corinthians<====>28591<====>Second Epistle to the Corinthians   The Second Epistle to the Corinthians, often written as 2 Corinthians, is a Pauline epistle and the eighth book of the New Testament of the Bible.  Paul the Apostle and "Timothy our brother" wrote this epistle to "the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia".  CompositionWhile there is little doubt among scholars that Paul is the author, there is discussion over whether the Epistle was originally one letter or composed from two or more of Paul's letters.   Although the New Testament contains only two letters to the Corinthian church, the evidence from the letters themselves is that he wrote at least four and the church replied at least once:1 Cor 5:9 ("I have written you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people", NIV) refers to an early letter, sometimes called the "warning letter"  or the "previous letter.

Shaka<====>28596<====>Shaka    Shaka kaSenzangakhona (c.  1787 – 22 September 1828), also known as Shaka  Zulu ( ), was one of the most influential monarchs of the Zulu Kingdom. He was born in the month of uNtulikazi (July) in the year of 1787 near present-day Melmoth, KwaZulu-Natal Province.  According to tradition, Shaka was conceived during an act of what began as ukuhlobonga, a form of sexual foreplay without penetration allowed to unmarried couples, also known as "the fun of the roads" (amahlaya endlela), during which the lovers became "carried away".  Due to persecution as a result of his illegitimacy, Shaka spent his childhood in his mother's settlements where he was initiated into an ibutho lempi (fighting unit). 

Sinusitis<====>28598<====>Sinusitis   Sinusitis, also known as a sinus infection or rhinosinusitis, is inflammation of the sinuses resulting in symptoms.   Common symptoms include thick nasal mucus, a plugged nose, and pain in the face.   Other signs and symptoms may include fever, headaches, poor sense of smell, sore throat, and cough.    The cough is often worse at night.   Serious complications are rare.It is defined as acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) if it lasts less than 4 weeks, and as chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) if it lasts for more than 12 weeks. 

Aos Sí<====>28601<====>Aos Sí    The   ( , older form aes sídhe  ) is the Irish term for a supernatural race in Irish mythology and Scottish mythology (usually spelled Sìth, however pronounced the same), comparable to the fairies or elves.  They are said to live underground in fairy mounds, across the western sea, or in an invisible world that coexists with the world of humans.  This world is described in the Lebor Gabála Érenn as a parallel universe in which the aos sí walk amongst the living.  In the Irish language, aos sí means "people of the mounds" (the mounds are known in Irish as "the sídhe ). 

Star cluster<====>28603<====>Star clusterStar clusters or star clouds are groups of stars.  Two types of star clusters can be distinguished: globular clusters are tight groups of hundreds or thousands of very old stars which are gravitationally bound, while open clusters, more loosely clustered groups of stars, generally contain fewer than a few hundred members, and are often very young.  Open clusters become disrupted over time by the gravitational influence of giant molecular clouds as they move through the galaxy, but cluster members will continue to move in broadly the same direction through space even though they are no longer gravitationally bound; they are then known as a stellar association, sometimes also referred to as a moving group.

Seinfeld<====>28606<====>Seinfeld    Seinfeld is  an American television sitcom that ran for nine seasons on NBC, from 1989 to 1998.  It was created by Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, with the latter starring as a fictionalized version of himself.  Set predominantly in an apartment building in Manhattan's Upper West Side in New York City, the show features a handful of Jerry's friends and acquaintances, particularly best friend George Costanza (Jason Alexander), former girlfriend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), and neighbor across the hall Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards).  It is often described as being "a show about nothing", as many of its episodes are about the minutiae of daily life. 

Sergei Diaghilev<====>28607<====>Sergei Diaghilev Sergei Pavlovich Diaghilev ( ;  ;   19 August 1929), usually referred to outside Russia as Serge, was a Russian art critic, patron, ballet impresario and founder of the Ballets Russes, from which many famous dancers and choreographers would arise. Early life and careerSergei Diaghilev was born to a wealthy and cultured family in Selishchi (Novgorod Governorate), Russia; his father, Pavel Pavlovich, was a cavalry colonel, but the family's money came mainly from vodka distilleries.   After the death of Sergei's mother, his father married Elena Valerianovna Panaeva, an artistic young woman who was on very affectionate terms with her stepson and was a strong influence on him. 

Soong Mei-ling<====>28608<====>Soong Mei-ling   Soong Mei-ling or Soong May-ling ( ; March 5, 1898  – October 23, 2003), also known as Madame Chiang Kai-shek or Madame Chiang, was a Chinese political figure who was First Lady of the Republic of China (ROC), the wife of Generalissimo and President Chiang Kai-shek.  Soong played a prominent role in the politics of the Republic of China and was the sister-in-law of Sun Yat-sen, the founder and the leader of the Republic of China.  She was active in the civic life of her country and held many honorary and active positions, including chairman of Fu Jen Catholic University. 

Soong sisters<====>28609<====>Soong sisters The Soong sisters ( ) were three Shanghainese (of Hainanese descent) Chinese women who were, along with their husbands, amongst China's most significant political figures of the early 20th century.  They each played a major role in influencing their husbands, who, along with their own positions of power, ultimately changed the course of Chinese history. Their father was American-educated Methodist minister Charlie Soong, who made a fortune in banking and printing.  Their mother was Ni Kwei-tseng (倪桂珍 Ní Guìzhēn), whose mother, Lady Xu, was a descendant of Ming dynasty mathematician and Jesuit convert Xu Guangqi.   All three sisters attended Wesleyan College in Macon, Georgia, United States. 

Second Epistle of Peter<====>28611<====>Second Epistle of Peter The Second Epistle of Peter, often referred to as Second Peter and  written 2 Peter or in Roman numerals II Peter (especially in older references), is a book of the New Testament of the Bible, traditionally held to have been written by Saint Peter.  Some scholars think Peter used an amanuensis, or secretary, to write the epistle.  Composition According to the Epistle itself, it was composed by the Apostle Peter, an eyewitness to Jesus' ministry.  It criticizes "false teachers" who distort the authentic, apostolic tradition, and predicts judgment for them.  2 Peter explains that God has delayed the Second Coming of Christ so that more people will have the chance to reject evil and find salvation. 

Second Epistle of John<====>28612<====>Second Epistle of John    The Second Epistle of John, often referred to as Second John and often written 2 John, is a book of the New Testament attributed to John the Evangelist, traditionally thought to be the author of the Gospel of John and the other two epistles of John. CompositionThe language of this epistle is remarkably similar to 3 John.  It is therefore suggested by a few that a single author composed both of these letters.  The traditional view contends that all the letters are by the hand of John the Apostle, and the linguistic structure, special vocabulary, and polemical issues all lend toward this theory. 

Sequencing<====>28615<====>Sequencing  In genetics and biochemistry, sequencing means to determine the primary structure (sometimes falsely called primary sequence) of an unbranched biopolymer.   Sequencing results in a symbolic linear depiction known as a sequence which succinctly summarizes much of the atomic-level structure of the sequenced molecule. DNA sequencing DNA sequencing is the process of determining the nucleotide order of a given DNA fragment.  So far, most DNA sequencing has been performed using the chain termination method developed by Frederick Sanger.  This technique uses sequence-specific termination of a DNA synthesis reaction using modified nucleotide substrates.   However, new sequencing technologies such as pyrosequencing are gaining an increasing share of the sequencing market. 

Shotgun sequencing<====>28616<====>Shotgun sequencingIn genetics, shotgun sequencing is a method used for sequencing long DNA strands.  It is named by analogy with the rapidly expanding, quasi-random firing pattern of a shotgun. The chain termination method of DNA sequencing (or "Sanger sequencing" for its developer Frederick Sanger) can only be used for fairly short strands of 100 to 1000 base pairs.  Longer sequences are subdivided into smaller fragments that can be sequenced separately, and subsequently they are re-assembled to give the overall sequence.  Two principal methods are used for this: primer walking (or "chromosome walking") which progresses through the entire strand piece by piece, and shotgun sequencing, which is a faster but more complex process that uses random fragments. 

Statue of Liberty<====>28617<====>Statue of LibertyThe Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World;  ) is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York Harbor in New York City, in the United States.  The copper statue, a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States, was designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and built by Gustave Eiffel.  The statue was dedicated on October 28, 1886. The Statue of Liberty is a figure of a robed woman representing Libertas, a Roman liberty goddess.  She holds a torch above her head with her right hand, and in her left hand carries a tabula ansata inscribed in Roman numerals with "JULY IV MDCCLXXVI" (July 4, 1776), the date of the U. 

Speech coding<====>28618<====>Speech coding Speech coding is an application of data compression of digital audio signals containing speech.  Speech coding uses speech-specific parameter estimation using audio signal processing techniques to model the speech signal, combined with generic data compression algorithms to represent the resulting modeled parameters in a compact bitstream.  The two most important applications of speech coding are mobile telephony and voice over IP.  The techniques employed in speech coding are similar to those used in audio data compression and audio coding where knowledge in psychoacoustics is used to transmit only data that is relevant to the human auditory system.

Stalinism<====>28621<====>StalinismStalinism is the means of governing and related policies implemented by Joseph Stalin.  Stalinist policies and ideas as developed in the Soviet Union, included rapid industrialization, the theory of socialism in one country, a centralized state, collectivization of agriculture, cult of personality  and subordination of the interests of foreign communist parties to those of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union—deemed by Stalinism to be the leading vanguard party of communist revolution at the time.

During the existence of the Jerusalem Temple, it was one of the Three Pilgrimage Festivals ( ,  ) on which the Israelites were commanded to perform a pilgrimage to the Temple. Sukkot has a double significance.  The one mentioned in the Book of Exodus is agricultural in nature—"Feast of Ingathering at the year's end" ( )—and marks the end of the harvest time and thus of the agricultural year in the Land of Israel. 

Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom<====>28623<====>Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom    Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom ( ), titled Pasolini's 120 Days of Sodom on English-language prints  and commonly referred to as simply Salò ( ), is a 1975 Italian-French horror art film  directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini.  The film is a loose adaptation of the book The 120 Days of Sodom by Marquis de Sade.  The film focuses on four wealthy, corrupt Italian libertines, during the time of the fascist Republic of Salò (1943–1945).  The libertines kidnap eighteen teenagers and subject them to four months of extreme violence, sadism, and sexual and mental torture. 

Selenocysteine<====>28624<====>Selenocysteine Selenocysteine (abbreviated as Sec or U, in older publications also as Se-Cys)  is the 21st proteinogenic amino acid. Selenocysteine exists naturally in all three domains of life, but not in every lineage, as a building block of selenoproteins.Selenocysteine is a cysteine analogue with a selenium-containing selenol group in place of the sulfur-containing thiol group. Selenocysteine is present in several enzymes (for example glutathione peroxidases, tetraiodothyronine 5' deiodinases, thioredoxin reductases, formate dehydrogenases, glycine reductases, selenophosphate synthetase 2, methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase B1 (SEPX1), and some hydrogenases). Selenocysteine was discovered by biochemist Thressa Stadtman  at the National Institutes of Health. 

Supervolcano<====>28625<====>Supervolcano  A supervolcano is a large volcano that has had an eruption of magnitude 8, which is the largest value on the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI).  This means the volume of deposits for that eruption is greater than 1,000 cubic kilometers (240 cubic miles).  A supervolcanic eruption may be a single short-term event or a massive outpouring of lava lasting up to millions of years.  Supervolcanoes occur when magma in the mantle rises into the crust but is unable to break through it and pressure builds in a large and growing magma pool until the crust is unable to contain the pressure. 

Single European Sky<====>28626<====>Single European Sky   The Single European Sky is a European Commission initiative by which the design, management and regulation of airspace will be coordinated throughout the European Union (ECAA area). This is expected to benefit all airspace users by ensuring the safe and efficient utilisation of airspace and the air traffic management system within and beyond the EU.  Airspace management is planned to move away from the previous domination by national boundaries to the use of 'functional airspace blocks' the boundaries of which will be designed to maximise the efficiency of the airspace.  Within the airspace, air traffic management, while continuing to have safety as its primary objective, will also be driven by the requirements of the airspace user and the need to provide for increasing air traffic. 

Sputtering<====>28627<====>SputteringSputtering is a process whereby particles are ejected from a solid target material due to bombardment of the target by energetic particles,    particularly gas ions in a laboratory.  It only happens when the kinetic energy of the incoming particles is much higher than conventional thermal energies (≫ 1 eV).  This process can lead, during prolonged ion or plasma bombardment of a material, to significant erosion of materials, and can thus be harmful.  On the other hand, it is commonly used for thin-film deposition, etching and analytical techniques.  Sputtering is done either using DC Voltage (DC Sputtering) or using AC Voltage (RF Sputtering). 

Satchel Paige<====>28630<====>Satchel Paige Leroy Robert "Satchel" Paige (July 7, 1906 – June 8, 1982) was an American Negro league baseball and Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher who became a legend in his own lifetime by being known as perhaps the best pitcher in baseball history, by his longevity in the game, and by attracting record crowds wherever he pitched. Paige was a right-handed pitcher, and at age 42 in 1948, he was the oldest major league rookie while playing for the Cleveland Indians.  He played with the St.  Louis Browns until age 47, and represented them in the All-Star Game in 1952 and 1953.

Raimi has also produced several successful television series and founded his own production company, Renaissance Pictures, in 1979.  Recently, he worked as the producer of The Possession.  Early lifeRaimi was born in Royal Oak, Michigan, to a Conservative Jewish family. 

Seventh-day Adventist Church<====>28632<====>Seventh-day Adventist Church    The Seventh-day Adventist Church  is a Protestant Christian denomination  distinguished by its observance of Saturday,  the seventh day of the week in Christian and Jewish calendars, as Sabbath, and by its emphasis on the imminent Second Coming (advent) of Jesus Christ.  The denomination grew out of the Millerite movement in the United States during the mid-19th century and was formally established in 1863.Among its founders was Ellen G.  White, whose extensive writings are still held in high regard by the church.  Much of the theology of the Seventh-day Adventist Church corresponds to common Protestant Christian teachings, such as the Trinity and the infallibility of Scripture. 

Scroll lock<====>28637<====>Scroll lockScroll lock (⤓ or ⇳) is a lock key (typically with an associated status light) on most IBM-compatible computer keyboards. Depending on the operating system, it may be used for different purposes and applications may assign functions to the key or change their behaviour depending on its toggling state.   The key is not frequently used, and therefore some reduced or specialized keyboards lack   altogether. Pressing   performs the same function as pressing  .  This behavior is a remnant of the original IBM PC keyboards, which did not have a dedicated   key. 

List of synthetic polymers<====>28638<====>List of synthetic polymersSynthetic polymers are human-made polymers.  From the utility point of view they can be classified into four main categories: thermoplastics, thermosets, elastomers and synthetic fibers.  They are found commonly in a variety of consumer products such as money, super glue, etc. A wide variety of synthetic polymers are available with variations in main chain as well as side chains.   The back bones of common synthetic polymers such as polythene, polystyrene and poly acrylates are made up of carbon-carbon bonds, whereas hetero chain polymers such as polyamides, polyesters, polyurethanes, polysulfides and polycarbonates have other elements (e. 

Stop codon<====>28639<====>Stop codonIn the genetic code, a stop codon (or termination codon) is a nucleotide triplet within messenger RNA that signals a termination of translation into proteins.   Proteins are based on polypeptides, which are unique sequences of amino acids.  Most codons in messenger RNA (from DNA) correspond to the addition of an amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain, which may ultimately become a protein.  Stop codons signal the termination of this process by binding release factors, which cause the ribosomal subunits to disassociate, releasing the amino acid chain.  While start codons need nearby sequences or initiation factors to start translation, a stop codon alone is sufficient to initiate termination. 

Symbionese Liberation Army<====>28642<====>Symbionese Liberation Army  The United Federated Forces of the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) was an American left-wing revolutionary and domestic terrorist organization active between 1973 and 1975 that considered itself a vanguard army.  The group committed bank robberies, two murders, and other acts of violence. The SLA became internationally notorious for the kidnapping of heiress Patty Hearst, abducting the 19-year-old from Berkeley, California.  Interest increased when Hearst, in audiotaped messages delivered to (and broadcast by) regional news media, announced that she had joined the SLA.  Hearst later said that members of the terrorist group threatened to kill her, held her in close confinement, and sexually assaulted and brainwashed her. 

Secondary sex characteristic<====>28643<====>Secondary sex characteristic Secondary sex characteristics are features that appear during puberty in humans, and at sexual maturity in other animals.  These are particularly evident in the sexually dimorphic phenotypic traits that distinguish the sexes of a species, but unlike the sex organs, are not directly part of the reproductive system.  They are believed to be the product of sexual selection for traits which display fitness, giving an individual an advantage over its rivals in courtship and aggressive interactions.  They are distinguished from the primary sex characteristics, the sex organs, which are directly necessary for sexual reproduction to occur. 

Smuggling<====>28645<====>Smuggling Smuggling is the illegal transportation of objects, substances, information or people, such as out of a house or buildings, into a prison, or across an international border, in violation of applicable laws or other regulations. There are various motivations to smuggle.  These include the participation in illegal trade, such as in the drug trade, illegal weapons trade, exotic wildlife trade, illegal immigration or illegal emigration, tax evasion, providing contraband to a prison inmate, or the theft of the items being smuggled.  Examples of non-financial motivations include bringing banned items past a security checkpoint (such as airline security) or the removal of classified documents from a government or corporate office. 

Smuggling in fiction<====>28646<====>Smuggling in fiction This list of smuggling in fiction includes works of fiction (in both prose and poetry) where smuggling is a prominent theme.  Smuggling is a common trope or theme in literature and can be found in a wide range of works – from the 18th century novels of Charlotte Turner Smith to Prosper Mérimée's 19th century novella, Carmen (the inspiration for numerous films as well as Bizet's opera, Carmen) Perriam, Christopher and Davies, Ann, Carmen: from silent film to MTV, Rodopi, 2005, pp.  55–56 and passim.to the James Bond novel (and later film) Diamonds are Forever. 

String searching algorithm<====>28648<====>String searching algorithmIn computer science, string searching algorithms, sometimes called string matching algorithms, are an important class of string algorithms that try to find a place where one or several strings (also called patterns) are found within a larger string or text. Let Σ be an alphabet (finite set).  The most basic example of string searching is where both the pattern and searched text are arrays of elements of Σ.  The Σ may be a usual human alphabet (for example, the letters A through Z in the Latin alphabet).  Other applications may use binary alphabet (Σ = {0,1}) or DNA alphabet (Σ = {A,C,G,T}) in bioinformatics. 

Stevens–Johnson syndrome<====>28649<====>Stevens–Johnson syndrome   Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a type of severe skin reaction.   Together with toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) it forms a spectrum of disease, with SJS being less severe.   Early symptoms include fever and flu-like symptoms.   A few days later the skin begins to blister and peel forming painful raw areas.   Mucous membranes, such as the mouth, are also typically involved.   Complications include dehydration, sepsis, pneumonia, and multiple organ failure.   The most common cause is certain medications such as lamotrigine, carbamazepine, allopurinol, sulfonamide antibiotics, and nevirapine. 

Stoichiometry<====>28650<====>StoichiometryStoichiometry    is the calculation of relative quantities of reactants and products in chemical reactions. Stoichiometry is founded on the law of conservation of mass where the total mass of the reactants equals the total mass of the products, leading to the insight that the relations among quantities of reactants and products typically form a ratio of positive integers.    This means that if the amounts of the separate reactants are known, then the amount of the product can be calculated.  Conversely, if one reactant has a known quantity and the quantity of the products can be empirically determined, then the amount of the other reactants can also be calculated. 

Outline of statistics<====>28651<====>Outline of statistics The following outline is provided as an overview and topical guide to statistics:Statistics – collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.  It is applicable to a wide variety of academic disciplines, from the physical and social sciences to the humanities; it is also used and misused for making informed decisions in all areas of business and government.  Nature of statisticsStatistics can be described as all of the following:Academic discipline: one with academic departments, curricula and degrees; national and international societies; and specialized journals. Scientific field (a branch of science) – widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature.

Sculpture or sculpting – activity of creating sculptures.   A person who creates sculptures is called a sculptor.  What type of thing is sculpture?Sculpture can be described as all of the following:Art – aesthetic expression for presentation or performance, and the work produced from this activity.  The word "art" is therefore both a verb and a noun, as is the term "sculpture". Work of art – aesthetic physical item or artistic creation. One of the arts – as an art form, sculpture is an outlet of human expression, that is usually influenced by culture and which in turn helps to change culture. 

Defamation<====>28661<====>Defamation   Defamation, calumny, vilification, or traducement is the communication of a false statement that harms the reputation of an individual person, business, product, group, government, religion, or nation.  Under common law, to constitute defamation, a claim must generally be false and must have been made to someone other than the person defamed.  False:Ron Hankin, Navigating the Legal Minefield of Private Investigations: A Career-Saving Guide for Private Investigators, Detectives, And Security Police,  Looseleaf Law Publications, 2008, p.  59.  "There are five essential elements to defamation: (1) The accusation is false; and (2) it impeaches the subject's character; and (3) it is published to a third person; and (4) it damages the reputation of the subject; and (5) that the accusation is done intentionally or with fault such as wanton disregard of facts. 

Sweetbread<====>28664<====>Sweetbread Sweetbread is a culinary name for the thymus (also called throat, gullet, or neck sweetbread) or the pancreas (also called heart, stomach, or belly sweetbread), especially of calf (ris de veau) and lamb (ris d'agneau), and, less commonly, of beef and pork.   The "heart" sweetbreads are more spherical in shape, and surrounded symmetrically by the "throat" sweetbreads, which are more cylindrical in shape. Various other glands used as food may also sometimes be called "sweetbreads," including the parotid gland ("cheek" or "ear" sweetbread), the sublingual glands ("tongue" sweetbreads or "throat bread") as well as ovary and testicles (cf. 

Principality of Sealand<====>28667<====>Principality of Sealand   The Principality of Sealand, more commonly known as Sealand, is a micronation that claims Roughs Tower, an offshore platform located in the North Sea approximately   off the coast of Suffolk, England, as its territory.  Roughs Tower is a disused Maunsell Sea Fort, originally called HM Fort Roughs, built as an anti-aircraft defensive gun platform by the British during World War II.Since 1967, the decommissioned HM Fort Roughs has been occupied by family and associates of Paddy Roy Bates, who claim that it is an independent sovereign state. 

Susan Faludi<====>28671<====>Susan Faludi Susan Charlotte Faludi (born April 18, 1959) is an American feminist   journalist and author.  She won a Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Journalism in 1991, for a report on the leveraged buyout of Safeway Stores, Inc. , a report that the Pulitzer Prize committee commended for depicting the "human costs of high finance".  She was also awarded the Kirkus Prize in 2016 for In the Darkroom.  Biographical informationFaludi was born in 1959 in Queens, New York, and grew up in Yorktown Heights, New York.  She was born to Marilyn (Lanning), a homemaker and journalist, and Stefánie Faludi (then known as Steven Faludi, and born István Friedman), who was a photographer. 

Oswald of Northumbria<====>28672<====>Oswald of Northumbria   Oswald (c 604 – 5 August 641/642 Bede gives the year of Oswald's death as 642, however there is some question as to whether what Bede considered 642 is the same as what would now be considered 642.  R.  L.  Poole (Studies in Chronology and History, 1934) put forward the theory that Bede's years began in September, and if this theory is followed (as it was, for instance, by Frank Stenton in his notable history Anglo-Saxon England, first published in 1943), then the date of the Battle of Heavenfield (and the beginning of Oswald's reign) is pushed back from 634 to 633. 

Steve Lacy<====>28677<====>Steve Lacy  Steve Lacy (July 23, 1934 – June 4, 2004), born Steven Norman Lackritz in New York City, was a jazz saxophonist and composer recognized as one of the important players of soprano saxophone.   Coming to prominence in the 1950s as a progressive dixieland musician, Lacy went on to a long and prolific career.  He worked extensively in experimental jazz and to a lesser extent in free improvisation, but Lacy's music was typically melodic and tightly-structured.  Lacy also became a highly distinctive composer, with compositions often built out of little more than a single questioning phrase, repeated several times. 

Sabah<====>28678<====>Sabah   {{Infobox settlement }}Sabah ( ) is a state of Malaysia located on the northern portion of Borneo Island.  Sabah has land borders with the Malaysian state of Sarawak to the southwest, and Indonesia's Kalimantan region to the south.  The Federal Territory of Labuan is an island just off the Sabah coast.  Sabah shares maritime borders with Vietnam in the west and the Philippines to the north and east.  Kota Kinabalu is the capital city, the economic centre of the state and the seat of the Sabah state government.  Other major towns in Sabah include Sandakan and Tawau. 

Sumatra<====>28679<====>Sumatra    Sumatra is a large island in western Indonesia that is part of the Sunda Islands.  It is the largest island that is located entirely in Indonesia (after Borneo and New Guinea, which are shared between Indonesia and other countries) and the sixth-largest island in the world at 473,481 km 2  (not including adjacent islands such as the Riau Islands and Bangka Belitung Islands). Sumatra is an elongated landmass spanning a diagonal northwest-southeast axis.  The Indian Ocean borders the west, northwest, and southwest coasts of Sumatra with the island chain of Simeulue, Nias and Mentawai off the western coast. 

Sarkel<====>28680<====>Sarkel Sarkel (or Sharkil, literally white house in Khazar language)  was a large limestone-and-brick fortress built by the Khazars with Byzantine assistance in the 830s.  It was named Sarkel, or 'white-house', because of the white limestone bricks used in its construction.  Sarkel was located on the right bank of the lower Don River, in present-day Rostov Oblast of Russia. ConstructionSarkel was built to protect the north-western border of the Khazar state in 833.  The Khazars asked their ally, Byzantine emperor Theophilus, for engineers to build a fortified capital, and Theophilus sent his chief engineer Petronas Kamateros. 

Streaming media<====>28682<====>Streaming media Streaming media is multimedia that is constantly received by and presented to an end-user while being delivered by a provider.  The verb "to stream" refers to the process of delivering or obtaining media in this manner; the term refers to the delivery method of the medium, rather than the medium itself, and is an alternative to file downloading, a process in which the end-user obtains the entire file for the content before watching or listening to it. A client end-user can use their media player to start playing the data file (such as a digital file of a movie or song) before the entire file has been transmitted. 

Session Initiation Protocol<====>28684<====>Session Initiation Protocol The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a communications protocol for signaling and controlling multimedia communication sessions in applications of Internet telephony for voice and video calls, in private IP telephone systems, as well as in instant messaging over Internet Protocol (IP) networks. The protocol defines the specific format of messages exchanged and the sequence of communications for cooperation of the participants.  SIP is a text-based protocol, incorporating many elements of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).   A call established with SIP may consist of multiple media streams, but no separate streams are required for applications, such as text messaging, that exchange data as payload in the SIP message. 

Squatting<====>28685<====>Squatting   Squatting is the action of occupying an abandoned or unoccupied area of land or a building, usually residential,  that the squatter does not own, rent or otherwise have lawful permission to use. Author Robert Neuwirth suggested in 2004 that there were one billion squatters globally.  He forecasts there will be two billion by 2030 and three billion by 2050.Yet, according to Kesia Reeve, "squatting is largely absent from policy and academic debate and is rarely conceptualised, as a problem, as a symptom, or as a social or housing movement. "   Squatting can be related to political movements, such as anarchist, autonomist, or socialist. 

South Holland<====>28687<====>South Holland {{Infobox settlement }}South Holland (   ) is a province in the midwest region of the Netherlands.  It has a population of just over 3. 6 million (as of 2015)  and a population density of about  ,  making it the country's most populous province and one of the world's most densely populated areas.

Screaming Lord Sutch<====>28690<====>Screaming Lord Sutch   David Edward Sutch (10 November 1940 – 16 June 1999), also known as 3rd Earl of Harrow, or simply Screaming Lord Sutch, was an English musician.  He was the founder of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party and served as its leader from 1983 to 1999, during which time he stood in numerous parliamentary elections.  He holds the record for losing more than 40 elections in which he stood from 1963 to 1997.  As a singer he variously worked with Keith Moon, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, Ritchie Blackmore, Charlie Watts and Nicky Hopkins. 

Protein secondary structure<====>28691<====>Protein secondary structure Protein secondary structure is the three dimensional form of local segments of proteins.  The two most common secondary structural elements are alpha helices and beta sheets, though beta turns and omega loops occur as well.  Secondary structure elements typically spontaneously form as an intermediate before the protein folds into its three dimensional tertiary structure. Secondary structure is formally defined by the pattern of hydrogen bonds between the amino hydrogen and carboxyl oxygen atoms in the peptide backbone.  Secondary structure may alternatively be defined based on the regular pattern of backbone dihedral angles in a particular region of the Ramachandran plot regardless of whether it has the correct hydrogen bonds. 

Sabermetrics<====>28692<====>SabermetricsSabermetrics is the empirical analysis of baseball, especially baseball statistics that measure in-game activity. Sabermetricians collect and summarize the relevant data from this in-game activity to answer specific questions.  The term is derived from the acronym SABR, which stands for the Society for American Baseball Research, founded in 1971.   The term sabermetrics was coined by Bill James, who is one of its pioneers and is often considered its most prominent advocate and public face.  Early historyHenry Chadwick, a sportswriter in New York, developed the box score in 1858. This was the first way statisticians were able to describe the sport of baseball. 

Space Quest<====>28694<====>Space Quest   Space Quest is a series of six comic science fiction computer adventure games released between 1986 and 1995.  The games follow the adventures of a hapless janitor named Roger Wilco as he campaigns through the galaxy for "truth, justice and really clean floors". Initially created for Sierra On-Line by Mark Crowe and Scott Murphy (who called themselves the "Two Guys from Andromeda"), the games parodied both science fiction properties such as Star Wars and Star Trek (the theme song itself is a parody of the Star Wars theme ), as well as pop-culture phenomena from McDonald's to Microsoft. 

Mercy rule<====>28695<====>Mercy rule A mercy rule,  slaughter rule, knockout rule, or skunk rule ends a two-competitor sports competition earlier than the scheduled endpoint if one competitor has a very large and presumably insurmountable scoring lead over the other.  It is called the mercy rule because it spares further humiliation for the loser.  It is common in youth sports in North America, where running up the score is considered unsporting.  It is especially common in  baseball and softball in which there is no game clock and a dominant team could in theory continue an inning. The rules vary widely, depending on the level of competition, but nearly all youth sports leagues and High school sports associations and many college sports associations in the United States have mercy rules for sports including baseball, softball, American football and association football. 

Sumbawa<====>28696<====>Sumbawa Sumbawa is an Indonesian island, in the middle of the Lesser Sunda Islands chain, with Lombok to the west, Flores to the east, and Sumba further to the southeast.  It is part of theprovince of West Nusa Tenggara, but there are presently steps being taken by the Indonesian government to turn the island into a separate province.   Traditionally the island is known as the source of sappanwood used to make red dye, as well as honey and sandalwood.  Its savanna-like climate and vast grassland is used to breed horses and cattle and to hunt deer. 

Spike Milligan<====>28698<====>Spike Milligan    Terence Alan Milligan   (16 April 1918 – 27 February 2002) was a British-Irish comedian, writer, musician, poet, playwright and actor. The son of an Irish father and an English mother, his early life was spent in India where he was born.  The majority of his working life was spent in the United Kingdom.  He disliked his first name, and began to call himself "Spike" after hearing a band on Radio Luxembourg called Spike Jones and his City Slickers.  Milligan was the co-creator, main writer and a principal cast member of the groundbreaking British radio programme, The Goon Show, performing a range of roles including the popular Eccles and Minnie Bannister characters. 

Sylvia Plath<====>28699<====>Sylvia Plath   Sylvia Plath ( ; October 27, 1932 – February 11, 1963) was an American poet, novelist, and short-story writer.  Born in Boston, she studied at Smith College and Newnham College at the University of Cambridge before receiving acclaim as a poet and writer.  She married fellow poet Ted Hughes in 1956, and they lived together in the United States and then in England.   They had two children, Frieda and Nicholas, before separating in 1962. Plath was clinically depressed for most of her adult life, and was treated multiple times with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). 

Shania Twain<====>28701<====>Shania Twain    Shania Twain, OC ( ; born Eilleen Regina Edwards; August 28, 1965) is a Canadian singer and songwriter.  She has sold over 100 million records, making her the best-selling female artist in country music history and among the best-selling music artists of all time.    Her success garnered her several honorific titles including the "Queen of Country Pop".  Twain's second album, 1995's The Woman in Me, brought her widespread success selling 20 million copies worldwide, spawning hits such as "Any Man of Mine" and earning her a Grammy Award.  Twain's third album, Come On Over, became the best-selling studio album of all time by a female act in any genre and the best-selling country album, selling around 40 million copies worldwide. 

Session Description Protocol<====>28702<====>Session Description Protocol The Session Description Protocol (SDP) is a format for describing streaming media communications parameters.   The IETF published the original specification as an IETF Proposed Standard in April 1998,  and subsequently published a revised specification as an IETF Proposed Standard as RFC 4566 in July 2006.    SDP is used for describing multimedia communication sessions for the purposes of session announcement, session invitation, and parameter negotiation.  SDP does not deliver any media by itself but is used between endpoints for negotiation of media type, format, and all associated properties.  The set of properties and parameters are often called a session profile. 

Session Announcement Protocol<====>28703<====>Session Announcement ProtocolSession Announcement Protocol (SAP) is an experimental protocol for broadcasting multicast session information.  SAP was published by the IETF as RFC 2974. SAP typically uses Session Description Protocol (SDP) as the format for Real-time Transport Protocol session descriptions.  Announcement data is sent using IP multicast and User Datagram Protocol. Under SAP, senders periodically broadcast SDP descriptions to a well-known multicast address and port.   A SAP listening application can listen to the SAP multicasts and construct a guide of all advertised multicast sessions. Announcement intervalThe announcement interval is cooperatively modulated such that all SAP announcements in the multicast delivery scope, by default, consume 4000 bits per second. 

Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language<====>28704<====>Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language  Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL ( )) is a World Wide Web Consortium recommended Extensible Markup Language (XML) markup language to describe multimedia presentations.  It defines markup for timing, layout, animations, visual transitions, and media embedding, among other things.   SMIL allows presenting media items such as text, images, video, audio, links to other SMIL presentations, and files from multiple web servers.  SMIL markup is written in XML, and has similarities to HTML. Version history , the W3C Recommendation for SMIL is SMIL 3. 0. SMIL 1. 0SMIL 1. 0 became a W3C Recommendation in June 1999. 

SECAM<====>28706<====>SECAM SECAM, also written SÉCAM ( ,  Séquentiel couleur à mémoire,  French for "Sequential colour with memory"), is an analogue color television system first used in France.  It was one of three major colour television standards, the others being the European PAL and North American NTSC. Development of SECAM began in 1956 by a team led by Henri de France working at Compagnie Française de Télévision (later bought by Thomson, now Technicolor).  The first SECAM broadcast was made in France in 1967, making it the first such standard to go live in Europe.  The system was also selected as the standard for colour in the Soviet Union, who began broadcasts shortly after the French. 

Smelt (fish)<====>28710<====>Smelt (fish)  Smelts are a family of small fish, the Osmeridae, found in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.  They are also known as freshwater smelts or typical smelts to distinguish them from the related Argentinidae, Bathylagidae, and Retropinnidae. Some smelt species are common in the North American Great Lakes, and in the lakes and seas of the northern part of Europe, where they run in large schools along the saltwater coastline during spring migration to their spawning streams.  In some western parts of the United States, smelt populations have greatly declined in recent decades, leading to their protection under the Endangered Species Act. 

Stethoscope<====>28714<====>StethoscopeThe stethoscope  is an acoustic medical device for auscultation, or listening to the internal sounds of an animal or human body.  It typically has a small disc-shaped resonator that is placed against the chest, and two tubes connected to earpieces.  It is often used to listen to lung and heart sounds.  It is also used to listen to intestines and blood flow in arteries and veins.  In combination with a sphygmomanometer, it is commonly used for measurements of blood pressure.  Less commonly, "mechanic's stethoscopes", equipped with rod shaped chestpieces, are used to listen to internal sounds made by machines (for example, sounds and vibrations emitted by worn ball bearings), such as diagnosing a malfunctioning automobile engine by listening to the sounds of its internal parts. 

System of a Down<====>28715<====>System of a Down System of a Down, sometimes shortened to System and abbreviated as SOAD, is an   heavy metal band from Glendale, California, formed in 1994.   The band currently consists of Serj Tankian (lead vocals, keyboards), Daron Malakian (vocals, guitar), Shavo Odadjian (bass, backing vocals) and John Dolmayan (drums).  The band achieved commercial success with the release of five studio albums, three of which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.  System of a Down has been nominated for four Grammy Awards, and their song "B. Y. 

Smelting<====>28716<====>Smelting    Smelting is a process of applying heat to ore to melt out a base metal.  It is a form of extractive metallurgy.  It is used to extract many metals from their ores, including silver, iron, copper, and other base metals.  Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gases or slag and leaving the metal base behind.  The reducing agent is commonly a source of carbon, such as coke—or, in earlier times, charcoal.  The carbon (or carbon monoxide derived from it) removes oxygen from the ore, leaving the elemental metal. 

Amsterdam Airport Schiphol<====>28721<====>Amsterdam Airport Schiphol   Amsterdam Airport Schiphol  , known informally as Schiphol ( ,  ), is the main international airport of the Netherlands.  It is located 9 kilometres (5. 6 miles)  southwest of Amsterdam, in the municipality of Haarlemmermeer, North Holland.  It is the third busiest airport in Europe in terms of passengers.  The airport is built as a single-terminal concept: one large terminal split into three large departure halls. Schiphol is the hub for KLM and its regional affiliate KLM Cityhopper as well as for Corendon Dutch Airlines, Martinair, Transavia and TUI fly Netherlands. 

Salman Rushdie<====>28722<====>Salman Rushdie   Sir Ahmed Salman Rushdie    (born 19 June 1947) is a British Indian novelist and essayist.  His second novel, Midnight's Children (1981), won the Booker Prize in 1981 and was deemed to be "the best novel of all winners" on two separate occasions, marking the 25th and the 40th anniversary of the prize.  Much of his fiction is set on the Indian subcontinent.  He combines magical realism with historical fiction; his work is concerned with the many connections, disruptions, and migrations between Eastern and Western civilizations. His epic fourth novel, The Satanic Verses (1988), was the subject of a major controversy, provoking protests from Muslims in several countries. 

Shirley Dean<====>28724<====>Shirley Dean Shirley Ann Dean (née Bryant, born 1935-36), considered moderate in Berkeley politics,  is an American politician who served as the Mayor of Berkeley, California (1994-2002).   Before serving two terms as Berkeley's Mayor, Dean served on the Berkeley City Council for 15 years (1975–94)    and was a leader of the Berkeley Democratic Club. Shirley Dean grew up in a single parent family and graduated from Berkeley High School (1952).   She was selected as a Distinguished Graduate in the Berkeley High School Hall of Fame  and was the first in her family to attend college. 

Superconducting magnetic energy storage<====>28728<====>Superconducting magnetic energy storage   Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) systems store energy in the magnetic field created by the flow of direct current in a  superconducting coil which has been cryogenically cooled to a temperature below its superconducting critical temperature. A typical SMES system includes three parts: superconducting coil, power conditioning system and cryogenically cooled refrigerator.  Once the superconducting coil is charged, the current will not decay and the magnetic energy can be stored indefinitely. The stored energy can be released back to the network by discharging the coil.  The power conditioning system uses an inverter/rectifier to transform alternating current (AC) power to direct current or convert DC back to AC power. 

Solution<====>28729<====>Solution  In chemistry, a solution is a homogeneous mixture composed of two or more substances.  In such a mixture, a solute is a substance dissolved in another substance, known as a solvent.  The mixing process of a solution happens at a scale where the effects of chemical polarity are involved, resulting in interactions that are specific to solvation.  The solution assumes the phase of the solvent when the solvent is the larger fraction of the mixture, as is commonly the case.   The concentration of a solute in a solution is the mass of that solute expressed as a percentage of the mass of the whole solution. 

Security engineering<====>28730<====>Security engineering Security engineering is a specialized field of engineering that focuses on the security aspects in the design of systems that need to be able to deal robustly with possible sources of disruption, ranging from natural disasters to malicious acts.  It is similar to other systems engineering activities in that its primary motivation is to support the delivery of engineering solutions that satisfy pre-defined functional and user requirements, but with the added dimension of preventing misuse and malicious behavior.   These constraints and restrictions are often asserted as a security policy. In one form or another, security engineering has existed as an informal field of study for several centuries. 

Stow-on-the-Wold<====>28731<====>Stow-on-the-Wold  Stow-on-the-Wold is a small market town and civil parish in Gloucestershire, England.  It is situated on top of an 800 ft (244 m) hill, at the convergence of a number of major roads through the Cotswolds, including the Fosse Way (A429).  The town was founded as a planned market place by Norman lords to take advantage of trade on the converging roads.  Fairs have been held by royal charter since 1330 and an annual horse fair is still held on the edge of the town.

Spaghetti code<====>28732<====>Spaghetti code Spaghetti code is a pejorative phrase for source code that has a complex and tangled control structure, especially one using many GOTO statements, exceptions, threads,  or other "unstructured" branching constructs.  It is named such because program flow is conceptually like a bowl of spaghetti, i. e.  twisted and tangled .   Spaghetti code can be caused by several factors, such as continuous modifications by several people with different programming styles over a long life cycle.  Structured programming greatly decreases the incidence of spaghetti code. HistoryAn early reference that contributed to the term in 1968 was a letter by Edsger Dijkstra to the Communications of the ACM, published under the title "Go to statement considered harmful". 

Steganography<====>28733<====>Steganography Steganography (   ) is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.  The word steganography combines the Greek words steganos ( ), meaning "covered, concealed, or protected," and graphein ( ) meaning "writing". The first recorded use of the term was in 1499 by Johannes Trithemius in his Steganographia, a treatise on cryptography and steganography, disguised as a book on magic.  Generally, the hidden messages appear to be (or be part of) something else: images, articles, shopping lists, or some other cover text.  For example, the hidden message may be in invisible ink between the visible lines of a private letter. 

Speed of light<====>28736<====>Speed of light   The speed of light in vacuum, commonly denoted  , is a universal physical constant important in many areas of physics.  Its exact value is   (approximately   , or  ).  It is exact because the unit of length, the metre, is defined from this constant and the international standard for time.According to special relativity,   is the maximum speed at which all conventional matter and hence all known forms of information in the universe can travel.  Though this speed is most commonly associated with light, it is in fact the speed at which all massless particles and changes of the associated fields travel in vacuum (including electromagnetic radiation and gravitational waves). 

Synchronization<====>28738<====>Synchronization    Synchronization is the coordination of events to operate a system in unison.  The conductor of an orchestra keeps the orchestra synchronized or in time.  Systems that operate with all parts in synchrony are said to be synchronous or in sync—and those that are not are asynchronous. Today, synchronization can occur between systems around the world through satellite navigation signals. TransportTime-keeping and synchronization of clocks has been a critical problem in long-distance ocean navigation.   Before global positioning systems, navigators required accurate time in conjunction with astronomical observations to determine how far east or west their vessel traveled. 

Sherwood Forest<====>28739<====>Sherwood Forest  Sherwood Forest is a royal forest in Nottinghamshire, England, famous by its historic association with the legend of Robin Hood. The area has been wooded since the end of the Ice Age (as attested by pollen sampling cores).  Today, Sherwood Forest National Nature Reserve encompasses 423. 2 hectares,   , surrounding the village of Edwinstowe, the site of Thoresby Hall. The forest that most people associate with Sherwood Forest is actually named Birklands and Bilhaugh.  It is a remnant of an older, much larger, royal hunting forest, which derived its name from its status as the shire  (or sher) wood of Nottinghamshire, which extended into several neighbouring counties (shires), bordered on the west along the River Erewash and the Forest of East Derbyshire. 

Sulawesi<====>28740<====>Sulawesi   Sulawesi, formerly known as Celebes (  or  ), is an island in Indonesia.  One of the four Greater Sunda Islands, and the world's eleventh-largest island, it is situated east of Borneo, west of the Maluku Islands, and south of Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago.  Within Indonesia, only Sumatra, Borneo and Papua are larger in territory, and only Java and Sumatra have larger populations. The landmass of Sulawesi includes four peninsulas: the northern Minahasa Peninsula; the East Peninsula; the South Peninsula; and the South-east Peninsula.  Three gulfs separate these peninsulas: the Gulf of Tomini between the northern Minahasa and East peninsulas; the Tolo Gulf between the East and Southeast peninsulas; and the Bone Gulf between the South and Southeast peninsulas. 

Southeast Asia<====>28741<====>Southeast Asia   Southeast Asia or Southeastern Asia is a subregion of Asia, consisting of the countries that are geographically south of China, east of India, west of New Guinea and north of Australia.   Southeast Asia is bordered to the north by East Asia, to the west by South Asia and Bay of Bengal, to the east by Oceania and Pacific Ocean, and to the south by Australia and Indian Ocean.  The region is the only part of Asia that lies partly within the Southern Hemisphere, although the majority of it is in the Northern Hemisphere. 

Supercontinent<====>28742<====>SupercontinentIn geology, a supercontinent is the assembly of most or all of Earth's continental blocks or cratons to form a single large landmass.  Rogers, John J.  W. , and M.  Santosh.  Continents and Supercontinents.  Oxford: Oxford UP, 2004.  Print.    However, the definition of a supercontinent can be ambiguous.  Many earth scientists use the term supercontinent to mean "a clustering of nearly all continents".  Hoffman, P. F. , "The break-up of Rodinia, Birth of Gondwana, True Polar Wander and the Snowball Earth".  Journal of African Earth Sciences, 17 (1999): 17–33. 

Slide rule<====>28743<====>Slide rule The slide rule, also known colloquially in the United States as a slipstick,is a mechanical analog computer.  The slide rule is used primarily for multiplication and division, and also for functions such as exponents, roots, logarithms and trigonometry, but typically not for addition or subtraction.  Though similar in name and appearance to a standard ruler, the slide rule is not meant to be used for measuring length or drawing straight lines. Slide rules exist in a diverse range of styles and generally appear in a linear or circular form with a standardized set of markings (scales) essential to performing mathematical computations. 

Styx<====>28745<====>Styx  In Greek mythology, Styx ( ;) is a deity and a river that forms the boundary between Earth and the Underworld (the domain often called Hades, which also is the name of its ruler).  The rivers Styx, Phlegethon, Acheron, Lethe, and Cocytus all converge at the center of the underworld on a great marsh, which sometimes is also called the Styx.  According to Herodotus, the river Styx originates near Feneos.   Styx is also a goddess with prehistoric roots in Greek mythology as a daughter of Tethys, after whom the river is named and because of whom it had miraculous powers. 

Sangha<====>28747<====>Sangha Sangha ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;   ) is a word in Pali and Sanskrit meaning "association", "assembly", "company" or "community" and most commonly refers in Buddhism to the monastic community of bhikkhus (monks) and bhikkhunis (nuns).  These communities are traditionally referred to as the bhikkhu-sangha or bhikkhuni-sangha.  As a separate category, those who have attained any of the four stages of enlightenment, whether or not they are members of the monastic community, they are referred to as the āryasaṅgha "noble Sangha".   According to the Theravada school, the term "sangha" does not refer to the community of sāvakas (lay followers) nor the community of Buddhists as a whole. 

Speed<====>28748<====>Speed In everyday use and in kinematics, the speed of an object is the magnitude of its velocity (the rate of change of its position); it is thus a scalar quantity.   The average speed of an object in an interval of time is the distance travelled by the object divided by the duration of the interval;    the instantaneous speed is the limit of the average speed as the duration of the time interval approaches zero. Speed has the dimensions of distance divided by time.  The SI unit of speed is the metre per second, but the most common unit of speed in everyday usage is the kilometre per hour or, in the US and the UK, miles per hour. 

Faster-than-light communication<====>28751<====>Faster-than-light communication Superluminal communication is a hypothetical process in which information is sent at faster-than-light (FTL) speeds.  The current scientific consensus is that faster-than-light communication is not possible, and to date it has not been achieved in any experiment. Under present knowledge superluminal communication is impossible  because, in a Lorentz-invariant theory, it could be used to transmit information into the past.  This contradicts causality and leads to logical paradoxes.  A number of theories and phenomena related to superluminal communication have been proposed or studied, including tachyons, quantum nonlocality, and wormholes. Proposed mechanismsTachyonsTachyonic particles are hypothetical particles that travel faster than light. 

Shah Jahan<====>28752<====>Shah Jahan    Shahab-ud-din Muhammad Khurram    (5 January 1592  – 22 January 1666)  better known by his regnal name Shah Jahan (Persian: "King of the World"),  was the fifth Mughal emperor, who reigned from 1628 to 1658.  Shah Jahan was widely considered to be the most competent of Emperor Jahangir's four sons and after Jahangir's death in late 1627, when a war of succession ensued, Shah Jahan emerged victorious.  He put to death all of his rivals for the throne and crowned himself emperor in January 1628 in Agra under the regnal title "Shah Jahan" (which was originally given to him as a princely title). 

Saul Bellow<====>28754<====>Saul Bellow  Saul Bellow (born Solomon Bellows; 10 June 1915 – 5 April 2005) was a Canadian-American writer of Jewish origin.  For his literary work, Bellow was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, the Nobel Prize for Literature, and the National Medal of Arts.   He is the only writer to win the National Book Award for Fiction three times  and he received the National Book Foundation's lifetime Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters in 1990.  "Distinguished Contribution to American Letters".  National Book Foundation.  Retrieved 12 March 2012.  In the words of the Swedish Nobel Committee, his writing exhibited "the mixture of rich picaresque novel and subtle analysis of our culture, of entertaining adventure, drastic and tragic episodes in quick succession interspersed with philosophic conversation, all developed by a commentator with a witty tongue and penetrating insight into the outer and inner complications that drive us to act, or prevent us from acting, and that can be called the dilemma of our age. 

Stereochemistry<====>28756<====>StereochemistryStereochemistry, a subdiscipline of chemistry, involves the study of the relative spatial arrangement of atoms that form the structure of molecules and their manipulation.  The study of stereochemistry focuses on stereoisomers, which by definition have the same molecular formula and sequence of bonded atoms (constitution), but differ in the three-dimensional orientations of their atoms in space.  For this reason, it is also known as 3D chemistry—the prefix "stereo-" means "three-dimensionality".  An important branch of stereochemistry is the study of chiral molecules.   Stereochemistry spans the entire spectrum of organic, inorganic, biological, physical and especially supramolecular chemistry. 

Simultaneity<====>28757<====>Simultaneity Simultaneity is the relation between two events assumed to be happening at the same time in a frame of reference.  According to Einstein's theory of relativity, simultaneity is not an absolute relation between events; what is simultaneous in one frame of reference will not necessarily be simultaneous in another.  (See Relativity of simultaneity. ) For inertial frames moving with respect to one another  at speeds small compared to the speed of light, this effect is small and can for practical matters be ignored, such that simultaneity can be treated as an absolute relation. The word derives from the Latin simul, at the same time (see sem-1 in Indo-European Roots) plus the suffix -taneous, abstracted from spontaneous  (which in turn comes directly from Latin ). 

Spacetime<====>28758<====>Spacetime   In physics, spacetime is any mathematical model that fuses the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time into a single four-dimensional continuum.  Spacetime diagrams are useful in visualizing and understanding relativistic effects such as how different observers perceive where and when events occur. ExplanationUntil the turn of the 20th century, the assumption had been that the three-dimensional geometry of the universe (its description in terms of locations, shapes, distances, and directions) was distinct from time (the measurement of when events occur within the universe).  However, Albert Einstein's 1905 special theory of relativity postulated that the speed of light through empty space has one definite value—a constant—that is independent of the motion of the light source. 

SimCity (1989 video game)<====>28760<====>SimCity (1989 video game)  SimCity, later renamed SimCity Classic,  is a city-building simulation video game, first released on February 2, 1989,   and designed by Will Wright for the Macintosh computer.  SimCity was Maxis's second product, which has since been ported into various personal computers and game consoles, and spawned several sequels including SimCity 2000 in 1993, SimCity 3000 in 1999, SimCity 4 in 2003, SimCity DS, SimCity Societies in 2007, and SimCity in 2013.  Until the release of The Sims in 2000, the SimCity series was the best-selling line of computer games made by Maxis. 

Sofonisba Anguissola<====>28761<====>Sofonisba Anguissola Sofonisba Anguissola (  – 16 November 1625), also known as Sophonisba Angussola or Anguisciola,   was an Italian Renaissance painter born in Cremona to a relatively poor noble family.   She received a well-rounded education, that included the fine arts, and her apprenticeship with local painters set a precedent for women to be accepted as students of art.  As a young woman, Anguissola traveled to Rome where she was introduced to Michelangelo, who immediately recognized her talent, and to Milan, where she painted the Duke of Alba.  The Spanish queen Elizabeth of Valois was a keen amateur painter, and in 1559 Anguissola was recruited to go to Madrid as her tutor, with the rank of lady-in-waiting. 

SameGame<====>28762<====>SameGame   is a tile-matching puzzle originally released under the name Chain Shot! in 1985 by Kuniaki Moribe (Morisuke).  It has since been ported to numerous computer platforms, handheld devices, and even TiVo , with new versions as of 2016. HistorySameGame was originally created as Chain Shot! in 1985 by Kuniaki Moribe.  It was distributed for Fujitsu's FM-8 and FM-7 platforms in a Japanese monthly personal computer magazine called Gekkan ASCII.  In 1992, the game was ported as SameGame to Unix platforms by Eiji Fukumoto, and to the NEC PC-9801 series by Wataru Yoshioka.  In 1993, it was ported to Windows 3. 

Sather<====>28763<====>Sather Sather is an object-oriented programming language.  It originated circa 1990 at the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) at the University of California, Berkeley, developed by an international team led by Steve Omohundro.  It supports garbage collection and generics by subtypes. Originally, it was based on Eiffel, but it has diverged, and now includes several functional programming features.  It is probably best to view it as an object-oriented language, with many ideas borrowed from Eiffel. Even the name is inspired by Eiffel; the Sather Tower is a recognizable landmark at Berkeley, named after Jane Krom Sather, the widow of Peder Sather, who donated large sums to the foundation of the university. 

Serotonin<====>28764<====>Serotonin    Serotonin (    ) or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is a monoamine neurotransmitter.  Biochemically derived from tryptophan,  serotonin is primarily found in the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract), blood platelets, and the central nervous system (CNS) of animals, including humans.  It is popularly thought to be a contributor to feelings of well-being and happiness.  Approximately 90% of the human body's total serotonin is located in the enterochromaffin cells in the GI tract, where it is used to regulate intestinal movements.    The serotonin is secreted luminally and basolaterally which leads to increased serotonin uptake by circulating platelets and activation after stimulation, which gives increased stimulation of myenteric neurons and gastrointestinal motility. 

Lawrence Alma-Tadema<====>28765<====>Lawrence Alma-Tadema   Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema,   ( ;  born Lourens Alma Tadema  ; 8 January 1836 – 25 June 1912) was a Dutch painter of special British denizenship.   Born in Dronrijp, the Netherlands, and trained at the Royal Academy of Antwerp, Belgium, he settled in England in 1870 and spent the rest of his life there.  A classical-subject painter, he became famous for his depictions of the luxury and decadence of the Roman Empire, with languorous figures set in fabulous marbled interiors or against a backdrop of dazzling blue Mediterranean Sea and sky. 

Surrealism<====>28766<====>Surrealism  Surrealism is a cultural movement that began in the early 1920s, and is best known for its visual artworks and writings.  Artists painted unnerving, illogical scenes with photographic precision, created strange creatures from everyday objects, and developed painting techniques that allowed the unconscious to express itself.   Its aim was to "resolve the previously contradictory conditions of dream and reality into an absolute reality, a super-reality". Surrealist works feature the element of surprise, unexpected juxtapositions and non sequitur; however, many Surrealist artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost, with the works being an artifact. 

Statics<====>28767<====>Statics  Statics is the branch of mechanics that is concerned with the analysis of loads (force and torque, or "moment") acting on physical systems that do not experience an acceleration (a=0), but rather, are in static equilibrium with their environment.  When in static equilibrium, the acceleration of the system is zero and the system is either at rest, or its center of mass moves at constant velocity.  The application of Newton's second law to a system gives:  \textbf F = m \textbf a \, .  Where bold font indicates a vector that has magnitude and direction. 

Maritime transport<====>28769<====>Maritime transport   Maritime transport is the transport of people (passengers) or goods (cargo) by water.  Freight transport has been achieved widely by sea throughout recorded history.  Although the importance of sea travel for passengers has decreased due to aviation, it is effective for short trips and pleasure cruises.  Transport by water is cheaper than transport by air,  despite fluctuating exchange rates and a fee placed on top of freighting charges for carrier companies known as  the Currency Adjustment Factor (CAF). Maritime transport can be realized over any distance by boat, ship, sailboat or barge, over oceans and lakes, through canals or along rivers. 

St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda<====>28771<====>St.  John's, Antigua and Barbuda St.  John's is the capital and largest city of Antigua and Barbuda, a country located in the West Indies in the Caribbean Sea.  With a population of 22,193,  St.  John's is the commercial centre of the nation and the chief port of the island of Antigua. History The settlement of St.  John's has been the administrative centre of Antigua and Barbuda since the islands were first colonised in 1632, and it became the seat of government when the nation achieved independence in 1981.

Sigtuna Municipality<====>28779<====>Sigtuna Municipality {{Infobox settlement }}Sigtuna Municipality (Sigtuna kommun) is a municipality in Stockholm County in east central Sweden.  Its seat is located in the town of Märsta, approximately 37 km north of the Swedish capital, Stockholm. The municipality is a part of Metropolitan Stockholm. The municipality consists of several former local government units and was formed in 1971.  It got its name from the small, but very old, City of Sigtuna, but the seat was placed in the larger modern town of Märsta. The three towns of the municipality are Märsta (pop.  23,000), Sigtuna (pop.  8,000) and Rosersberg (pop. 

Self-similarity<====>28782<====>Self-similarity In mathematics, a self-similar object is exactly or approximately similar to a part of itself (i. e.  the whole has the same shape as one or more of the parts).  Many objects in the real world, such as coastlines, are statistically self-similar: parts of them show the same statistical properties at many scales.    PDF  Self-similarity is a typical property of artificial fractals.  Scale invariance is an exact form of self-similarity where at any magnification there is a smaller piece of the object that is similar to the whole.  For instance, a side of the Koch snowflake is both symmetrical and scale-invariant; it can be continually magnified 3x without changing shape. 

Small beer<====>28785<====>Small beerSmall beer (also, small ale) is a lager or ale that contains very little alcohol, typically about 0. 75% .  Sometimes unfiltered and porridge-like, it was a favored drink in Medieval Europe and colonial North America as against more expensive beer with higher alcohol.   Small beer was also produced in households for consumption by children and servants.  In October 2017, the Small Beer Brew Co.  launched the world's first brewery dedicated to the production of Small Beer launched in London.  UsageUntil the mid-20th century, much drinking water was likely to make one sick because of poor sanitation. 

Sambia Peninsula<====>28787<====>Sambia Peninsula Sambia ( , Sambiysky poluostrov, literally the Sambiysky Peninsula) or Samland  ( , Zemlandsky poluostrov, literally the Zemlandsky Peninsula) or Kaliningrad Peninsula (official name,  , Kaliningradsky poluostrov) is a peninsula in the Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia, on the southeastern shore of the Baltic Sea.  The peninsula is bounded by the Curonian Lagoon (to the north-east), the Vistula Lagoon (on the southwest), the Pregel River (on the south), and the Deyma River (on the east).  As Samland is surrounded on all sides by water, it is technically an island.  Prior to 1945 it formed an important part of East Prussia. 

Sovereignty<====>28791<====>Sovereignty   Sovereignty is the full right and power of a governing body over itself, without any interference from outside sources or bodies.  In political theory, sovereignty is a substantive term designating supreme authority over some polity.It is a basic principle underlying the dominant Westphalian model of state foundation. Different approachesThe concepts of sovereignty have been discussed throughout history, and are still actively debated.   Its definition, concept, and application has changed throughout, especially during the Age of Enlightenment.  The current notion of state sovereignty contains four aspects consisting of territory, population, authority and recognition. 

SNAFU<====>28798<====>SNAFU  SNAFU is an acronym that is widely used to stand for the sarcastic expression Situation Normal: All Fucked Up, as a well-known example of military acronym slang, however the original military acronym stood for "Status Nominal: All Fucked Up. " It is sometimes bowdlerized to "all fouled up" or similar.   It means that the situation is bad, but that this is a normal state of affairs.  The acronym is believed to have originated in the United States Marine Corps during World War II. In modern usage, SNAFU is sometimes used as an interjection.  SNAFU also sometimes refers to a bad situation, mistake, or cause of trouble. 

Democratic Left Alliance<====>28800<====>Democratic Left Alliance   Democratic Left Alliance ( , SLD) is a social-democraticpolitical party in Poland.   It was formed in 1991 as an electoral alliance of centre-left parties, and became a single party on 15 April 1999.  The SLD has no representation in the Sejm or Senate following the 2015 parliamentary election.  The party is a member of the Party of European Socialists and Progressive Alliance. HistoryIdeology and support patternsThe coalition can be classified as left-wing, however, during the 1990s, it managed to attract voters from the pro-market and even right-wing camp. 

Segmentation fault<====>28803<====>Segmentation fault  In computing, a segmentation fault (often shortened to segfault) or access violation is a fault, or failure condition, raised by hardware with memory protection, notifying an operating system (OS) the software has attempted to access a restricted area of memory (a memory access violation).  On standard x86 computers, this is a form of general protection fault.  The OS kernel will, in response, usually perform some corrective action, generally passing the fault on to the offending process by sending the process a signal.  Processes can in some cases install a custom signal handler, allowing them to recover on their own, Expert C programming: deep C secrets By Peter Van der Linden, page 188  but otherwise the OS default signal handler is used, generally causing abnormal termination of the process (a program crash), and sometimes a core dump. 

Source separation<====>28804<====>Source separation Source separation problems in digital signal processing are those in which several signals have been mixed together into a combined signal and the objective is to recover the original component signals from the combined signal.  The classical example of a source separation problem is the cocktail party problem, where a number of people are talking simultaneously in a room (for example, at a cocktail party), and a listener is trying to follow one of the discussions.  The human brain can handle this sort of auditory source separation problem, but it is a difficult problem in digital signal processing. 

Stephen Cole Kleene<====>28805<====>Stephen Cole Kleene Stephen Cole Kleene(January 5, 1909 – January 25, 1994) was an American mathematician.  One of the students of Alonzo Church, Kleene, along with Rózsa Péter, Alan Turing, Emil Post, and others, is best known as a founder of the branch of mathematical logic known as recursion theory, which subsequently helped to provide the foundations of theoretical computer science.  Kleene's work grounds the study of computable functions.  A number of mathematical concepts are named after him: Kleene hierarchy, Kleene algebra, the Kleene star (Kleene closure), Kleene's recursion theorem and the Kleene fixpoint theorem. 

Shabbat<====>28809<====>Shabbat   Shabbat ( ;    , "rest" or "cessation") or Shabbos ( ,  ) or the Sabbath is Judaism's day of rest and seventh day of the week, on which religious Jews, Samaritans and certain Christians (such as Seventh-day Adventists and Seventh Day Baptists) remember the Biblical creation of the heavens and the earth in six days and the Exodus of the Hebrews, and look forward to a future Messianic Age.  Shabbat observance entails refraining from work activities, often with great rigor, and engaging in restful activities to honor the day.  Judaism's traditional position is that unbroken seventh-day Shabbat originated among the Jewish people, as their first and most sacred institution, though some suggest other origins. 

Saki<====>28810<====>Saki    Hector Hugh Munro (18 December 1870 – 14 November 1916), better known by the pen name Saki, and also frequently as H.  H.  Munro, was a British writer whose witty, mischievous and sometimes macabre stories satirize Edwardian society and culture.  He is considered a master of the short story, and often compared to O.  Henry  and Dorothy Parker .  Influenced by Oscar Wilde, Lewis Carroll and Rudyard Kipling, he himself influenced A.  A.  Milne, Noël Coward and P.  G.  Wodehouse.  Besides his short stories (which were first published in newspapers, as was customary at the time, and then collected into several volumes), he wrote a full-length play, The Watched Pot, in collaboration with Charles Maude; two one-act plays; a historical study, The Rise of the Russian Empire, the only book published under his own name; a short novel, The Unbearable Bassington; the episodic The Westminster Alice (a parliamentary parody of Alice in Wonderland); and When William Came, subtitled A Story of London Under the Hohenzollerns, a fantasy about a future German invasion and occupation of Britain. 

Static program analysis<====>28811<====>Static program analysis Static program analysis is the analysis of computer software that is performed without actually executing programs (analysis performed on executing programs is known as dynamic analysis).   In most cases the analysis is performed on some version of the source code, and in the other cases, some form of the object code. The term is usually applied to the analysis performed by an automated tool, with human analysis being called program understanding, program comprehension, or code review.  Software inspections and software walkthroughs are also used in the latter case. RationaleThe sophistication of the analysis performed by tools varies from those that only consider the behaviour of individual statements and declarations, to those that include the complete source code of a program in their analysis. 

Samuel Mudd<====>28812<====>Samuel Mudd  Samuel Alexander Mudd (December 20, 1833 – January 10, 1883) was an American physician who was imprisoned for conspiring with John Wilkes Booth in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. Working as a doctor and tobacco-farmer in Southern Maryland, Mudd used slaves and declared his belief in slavery as a God-given institution.  The Civil War seriously damaged his business, especially when Maryland abolished slavery in 1864.  That year, he first met Booth, who was planning to kidnap Lincoln, and Mudd was seen in company with three of the conspirators.  However, his part in the plot, if any, remains unclear. 

Secure Shell<====>28814<====>Secure Shell  Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network.   Network Working Group of the IETF, January 2006, RFC 4251, The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Architecture  The best known example application is for remote login to computer systems by users. SSH provides a secure channel over an unsecured network in a client-server architecture, connecting an SSH client application with an SSH server.   Network Working Group of the IETF, January 2006, RFC 4252, The Secure Shell (SSH) Authentication Protocol   Common applications include remote command-line login and remote command execution, but any network service can be secured with SSH. 

Generalissimo Francisco Franco is still dead<====>28819<====>Generalissimo Francisco Franco is still dead "Generalissimo  Francisco Franco is still dead" is a catchphrase that originated in 1975 during the first season of NBC's Saturday Night (now called Saturday Night Live, or SNL) and which mocked the weeks-long media reports of the Spanish Caudillo's impending death.  It was one of the first catchphrases from the series to enter the general lexicon. OriginThe death of Spanish Caudillo Francisco Franco during the first season of NBC's Saturday Night served as the source of the phrase.  Franco lingered near death for weeks before dying.  On slow news days, United States network television newscasters sometimes noted that Franco was still alive, or not yet dead. 

Son House<====>28820<====>Son House   Eddie James "Son" House, Jr.  (March 21, 1902 His date of birth is a matter of some debate.  House alleged that he was middle-aged during World War I and that he was 79 in 1965, which would make his date of birth around 1886.  However, all legal records give his date of birth as March 21, 1902.   – October 19, 1988) was an American delta blues singer and guitarist, noted for his highly emotional style of singing and slide guitar playing. After years of hostility to secular music, as a preacher and for a few years also as a church pastor, he turned to blues performance at the age of 25. 

Sex worker<====>28822<====>Sex worker A sex worker is a person who is employed in the sex industry.  Oxford English Dictionary, "sex worker"  The term is used in reference to all those in all areas of the sex industry including those who provide direct sexual services as well as the staff of such industries.  Some sex workers are paid to engage in sex acts or sexually explicit behavior which involve varying degrees of physical contact with clients (prostitutes and some but not all professional dominants); pornography models and actors engage in sexually explicit behavior which are filmed or photographed.  Phone sex operators have sexually-oriented conversations with clients, and do auditive sexual roleplay. 

Stéphane Mallarmé<====>28824<====>Stéphane Mallarmé  Stéphane Mallarmé ( ;   ; 18 March 1842 – 9 September 1898), whose real name was Étienne Mallarmé, was a French poet and critic.   He was a major French symbolist poet, and his work anticipated and inspired several revolutionary artistic schools of the early 20th century, such as Cubism, Futurism, Dadaism, and Surrealism. BiographyStéphane Mallarmé was born in Paris.  He was a boarder at the Pensionnat des Frères des écoles chrétiennes à Passy between 6  or 9 October 1852 and March 1855.   He worked as an English teacher and spent much of his life in relative poverty but was famed for his salons, occasional gatherings of intellectuals at his house on the rue de Rome for discussions of poetry, art and philosophy. 

Submarine<====>28825<====>Submarine A submarine (or simply sub) is a watercraft capable of independent operation underwater.  It differs from a submersible, which has more limited underwater capability.  The term most commonly refers to a large, crewed vessel.  It is also sometimes used historically or colloquially to refer to remotely operated vehicles and robots, as well as medium-sized or smaller vessels, such as the midget submarine and the wet sub.  The noun submarine evolved as a shortened form of submarine boat;  by naval tradition, submarines are usually referred to as "boats" rather than as "ships", regardless of their size (boat is usually reserved for seagoing vessels of relatively small size). 

Second Epistle to the Thessalonians<====>28827<====>Second Epistle to the Thessalonians   The Second Epistle to the Thessalonians, often referred to  as Second Thessalonians (US) or Two Thessalonians (UK)  (and written 2 Thessalonians) is a book from the New Testament of the Christian Bible.  It is traditionally attributed to Paul the Apostle, as it begins, "Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians"  and ends, "I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand, which is the distinguishing mark in all my letters. "  Modern biblical scholarship is divided on whether Paul was the author or not; many scholars question its authenticity based on what they see as differences in style and theology between this and the First Epistle to the Thessalonians. 

Poetry slam<====>28828<====>Poetry slam  A poetry slam is a competition in which poets read or recite original work.  Poetry slam began in Chicago in 1984 with its first competition designed to move poetry recitals from academia to a popular audience when American poet Marc Smith began experimenting with existing open microphone venues for poetry readings by making them competitive.   The performances at a poetry slam are judged by a panel of judges, typically five, and usually selected from the audience, or sometimes judged by audience response.   The judges usually give each poem a score on a scale of 0–10 (zero being the worst and ten being the best). 

Sestina<====>28829<====>Sestina A sestina (Old Occitan: cledisat  ; also known as sestine, sextine, sextain) is a fixed verse form consisting of six stanzas of six lines each, normally followed by a three-line envoi.  The words that end each line of the first stanza are used as line endings in each of the following stanzas, rotated in a set pattern. The invention of the form is usually attributed to Arnaut Daniel, a troubadour of 12th-century Provence, and the first sestinas were written in the Occitan language of that region.  The form was cultivated by his fellow troubadours, then by other poets across Continental Europe in the subsequent centuries; they contributed to what would become the "standard form" of the sestina. 

Song<====>28830<====>Song    A song, most broadly, is a single (and often standalone) work of music that is typically intended to be sung by the human voice with distinct and fixed pitches and patterns using sound and silence and a variety of forms that often include the repetition of sections.  Written words created specifically for music or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics.  If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is an art song.  Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. 

Sir Gawain and the Green Knight<====>28833<====>Sir Gawain and the Green KnightSir Gawain and the Green Knight (Middle English: Sir Gawayn and þe Grene Knyȝt) is a late 14th-century Middle English chivalric romance.  It is one of the best known Arthurian stories, with its plot combining two types of folklore motifs, the beheading game and the exchange of winnings.  The Green Knight is interpreted by some as a representation of the Green Man of folklore and by others as an allusion to Christ.  Written in stanzas of alliterative verse, each of which ends in a rhyming bob and wheel,  it draws on Welsh, Irish, and English stories, as well as the French chivalric tradition. 

Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood<====>28834<====>Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood   Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmoodalternative spellings: Sultan Bashir-ud-Din Mehmood.  In news media of Pakistan, he is often called as Dr.  Bashiruddin( ; born 1940;    SI), is a Pakistani nuclear engineer and a Islamist scholar on Islamic studies.  He was the subject of a criminal probe launched by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on suspicions on unauthorized travel in Afghanistan prior to the terrorist attacks in 2001. Having spent a distinguished career in PAEC, he founded the Ummah Tameer-e-Nau (UTN) in 1999– a right-wing organization that was banned and sanctioned by the United States in 2001. 

Siege tower<====>28837<====>Siege towerA siege tower or breaching tower (or in the Middle Ages, a belfry Castle: Stephen Biesty'sSections.  Dorling Kindersley Pub (T); 1st American edition (September 1994).  Siege towers were invented in 300 BC.    ) is a specialized siege engine, constructed to protect assailants and ladders while approaching the defensive walls of a fortification.  The tower was often rectangular with four wheels with its height roughly equal to that of the wall or sometimes higher to allow archers to stand on top of the tower and shoot arrows into the fortification.  Because the towers were wooden and thus flammable, they had to have some non-flammable covering of iron or fresh animal skins. 

Sharia<====>28840<====>ShariaSharia, Sharia law, or Islamic law (  ( )) is the religious law forming part of the Islamic tradition.It is derived from the religious precepts of Islam, particularly the Quran and the Hadith.  In Arabic, the term sharīʿah refers to God's immutable divine law and is contrasted with fiqh, which refers to its human scholarly interpretations. The manner of its application in modern times has been a subject of dispute between Muslim traditionalists and reformists.  Traditional theory of Islamic jurisprudence recognizes four sources of sharia: the Quran, sunnah (authentic hadith), qiyas (analogical reasoning), and ijma (juridical consensus). 

Sunnah<====>28841<====>Sunnah    Sunnah ( ,  ,  , plural ) is the verbally transmitted record of the teachings, deeds and sayings, silent permissions (or disapprovals) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, as well as various reports about Muhammad's companions.  The Quran (the holy book of Islam) and the sunnah make up the two primary sources of Islamic theology and law.    The sunnah is also defined as "a path, a way, a manner of life"; "all the traditions and practices" of the Islamic prophet that "have become models to be followed" by Muslims. 

Safe sex<====>28845<====>Safe sex  Safe sex is sexual activity engaged in by people who have taken precautions to protect themselves against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as HIV.   It is also referred to as safer sex or protected sex, while unsafe or unprotected sex is sexual activity engaged in without precautions, especially forgoing condom use. Some sources prefer the term safer sex to more precisely reflect the fact that these practices reduce, but do not always completely eliminate, the risk of disease transmission.  The term sexually transmitted infections (STIs) has gradually become preferred over sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among medical sources, as it has a broader range of meaning; a person may be infected, and may potentially infect others, without showing signs of disease. 

Scabies<====>28848<====>Scabies   Scabies, also known as the seven-year itch, is a contagious skin infestation by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The most common symptoms are severe itchiness and a pimple-like rash.   Occasionally, tiny burrows may be seen in the skin.   In a first ever infection a person will usually develop symptoms in between two and six weeks.   During a second infection symptoms may begin in as little as 24 hours.   These symptoms can be present across most of the body or just certain areas such as the wrists, between fingers, or along the waistline. 

Shiva<====>28849<====>Shiva  Shiva ( ; Sanskrit: शिव, IAST: Śiva, lit.  the auspicious one)  is one of the principal deities of Hinduism.  He is the Supreme Being within Shaivism, one of the major traditions within contemporary Hinduism.Shiva is the "destroyer of evil and the transformer" within the Trimurti, the Hindu trinity that includes Brahma and Vishnu.  Zimmer (1972) pp.  124-126   In Shaivism tradition, Shiva is the Supreme being who creates, protects and transforms the universe.In the goddess tradition of Hinduism called Shaktism, the goddess is described as supreme, yet Shiva is revered along with Vishnu and Brahma.

Syphilis<====>28852<====>SyphilisSyphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum.The signs and symptoms of syphilis vary depending in which of the four stages it presents (primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary).   The primary stage classically presents with a single chancre (a firm, painless, non-itchy skin ulceration) but there may be multiple sores.   In secondary syphilis a diffuse rash occurs, which frequently involves the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.   There may also be sores in the mouth or vagina. 

Smiling Buddha<====>28853<====>Smiling Buddha    Smiling Buddha This test has many code names.  Civilian scientists called it "Operation Smiling Buddha" and the Indian Army referred to it as Operation Happy Krishna.  According to United States Military Intelligence, Operation Happy Krishna was the code name for the Indian Army's construction of the underground site in which the tests were conducted.  The Ministry of External Affairs designated the test as Pokhran-I.   (MEA designation: Pokhran-I) was the assigned code name of India's first successful nuclear bomb test on 18 May 1974.   The bomb was detonated on the army base, Pokhran Test Range (PTR), in Rajasthan by the Indian Army under the supervision of several key Indian generals. 

Shea Stadium<====>28855<====>Shea Stadium  Shea Stadium (formally known as William A.  Shea Municipal Stadium)  ) was a stadium in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, Queens, New York City.  Scanned picture of the dedication handout that shows the stadium is in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park.   Built as a multi-purpose stadium, it was the home park of Major League Baseball's New York Mets from 1964 to 2008, as well as the New York Jets football team from 1964 to 1983. Shea Stadium was named in honor of William A.  Shea, the man who was most responsible for bringing National League baseball back to New York. 

Signal transduction<====>28857<====>Signal transduction Signal transduction is the process by which a chemical or physical signal is transmitted through a cell as a series of molecular events, most commonly protein phosphorylation catalysed by protein kinases, which ultimately results in a cellular response.  Proteins responsible for detecting stimuli are generally termed receptors, although in some cases the term sensor is used.   The changes elicited by ligand binding (or signal sensing) in a receptor give rise to a signaling cascade, which is a chain of biochemical events along a signaling pathway.  When signaling pathways interact with one another they form networks, which allow cellular responses to be coordinated, often by combinatorial signaling events. 

Stone–Weierstrass theorem<====>28858<====>Stone–Weierstrass theoremIn mathematical analysis, the Weierstrass approximation theorem states that every continuous function defined on a closed interval   can be uniformly approximated as closely as desired by a polynomial function.  Because polynomials are among the simplest functions, and because computers can directly evaluate polynomials, this theorem has both practical and theoretical relevance, especially in polynomial interpolation.  The original version of this result was established by Karl Weierstrass in 1885 using the Weierstrass transform. Marshall H.  Stone considerably generalized the theorem   and simplified the proof  .   His result is known as the Stone–Weierstrass theorem. 

Simile<====>28860<====>SimileA simile ( ) is a figure of speech that directly compares two things. Although similes and metaphors are similar, similes explicitly use connecting words (such as like, as, so, than, or various verbs such as resemble),  though these specific words are not always necessary.   While similes are mainly used in forms of poetry that compare the inanimate and the living, there are also terms in which similes and personifications are used for humorous purposes and comparison.

Sigyn<====>28867<====>Sigyn In Norse mythology, Sigyn (Old Norse "victorious girl-friend" Orchard (1997:146).  ) is a goddess and is the wife of Loki.  Sigyn is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson.  In the Poetic Edda, little information is provided about Sigyn other than her role in assisting Loki during his captivity.  In the Prose Edda, her role in helping her husband through his time spent in bondage is stated again, she appears in various kennings, and her status as a goddess is mentioned twice. 

Saudi Arabian–Iraqi neutral zone<====>28868<====>Saudi Arabian–Iraqi neutral zone The Saudi–Iraqi neutral zone was an area of 7,044 km² on the border between Saudi Arabia and Iraq within which the border between the two countries had not been settled.  The neutral zone came into existence following the Uqair Protocol of 1922 which defined the border between Iraq and the Sultanate of Nejd (Saudi Arabia's predecessor state).  The neutral zone officially ended in 1981, when Iraq and Saudi Arabia agreed on the partition of the zone.  HistoryThe Treaty of Muhammarah (Khorramshahr), 5 May 1922,    forestalled the imminent conflict between the United Kingdom, which held the mandate for Iraq, and the Kingdom of Nejd, which later became Saudi Arabia (when combined with the Kingdom of Hejaz).

Scotch whisky<====>28896<====>Scotch whisky  Scotch whisky ( ; often simply called Scotch) is malt whisky or grain whisky made in Scotland.  Scotch whisky must be made in a manner specified by law.  All Scotch whisky was originally made from malted barley.  Commercial distilleries began introducing whisky made from wheat and rye in the late 18th century.   Scotch whisky is divided into five distinct categories: single malt Scotch whisky, single grain Scotch whisky, blended malt Scotch whisky (formerly called "vatted malt" or "pure malt"), blended grain Scotch whisky, and blended Scotch whisky.   All Scotch whisky must be aged in oak barrels for at least three years. 

Special drawing rights<====>28897<====>Special drawing rights Special drawing rights (ISO 4217 currency code XDR,   also abbreviated SDR) are supplementary foreign-exchange reserve assets defined and maintained by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  The XDR is the unit of account for the IMF, and is not a currency per se.   XDRs instead represent a claim to currency held by IMF member countries for which they may be exchanged.   The XDR was created in 1969 to supplement a shortfall of preferred foreign-exchange reserve assets, namely gold and the U. S.  dollar.   XDRs are allocated to countries by the IMF. 

Special Operations Executive<====>28898<====>Special Operations Executive   The Special Operations Executive (SOE) was a British World War II organisation.  Following Cabinet approval, it was officially formed by Minister of Economic Warfare Hugh Dalton on 22 July 1940, to conduct espionage, sabotage and reconnaissance in occupied Europe (and later, also in occupied Southeast Asia) against the Axis powers, and to aid local resistance movements. One of the organisations from which SOE was created was also involved in the formation of the Auxiliary Units, a top secret "stay-behind" resistance organisation which would have been activated in the event of a German invasion of Britain. 

System request<====>28899<====>System requestSystem request (often abbreviated SysRq or Sys Req) is a key on personal computer keyboards that has no standard use.Introduced by IBM with the PC/AT, it was intended to be available as a special key to directly invoke low-level operating system functions with no possibility of conflicting with any existing software.  A special BIOS routine – software interrupt 0x15, subfunction 0x85    – was added to signal the OS when SysRq was pushed or released.  Unlike most keys, when it is pressed nothing is stored in the keyboard buffer. HistoryThe specific low level function that the SysRq key was meant for was to switch between operating systems. 

Split infinitive<====>28900<====>Split infinitive In the English language, a split infinitive or cleft infinitive is a grammatical construction in which a word or phrase comes between the to and the bare infinitive of the to form of the infinitive verb.  Usually an adverb or adverbial phrase comes between them. A well-known example occurs in the opening sequence of the Star Trek television series: "to boldly go where no man has gone before"; the adverb boldly is said to split the infinitive to go.   Sometimes more than one word splits the infinitive, as in: "The population is expected to more than double in the next ten years". 

Symmetric group<====>28901<====>Symmetric group  In abstract algebra, the symmetric group S n  on a finite set of n symbols is the group whose elements are all the permutation operations that can be performed on n distinct symbols, and whose group operation is the composition of such permutation operations, which are defined as bijective functions from the set of symbols to itself.  Jacobson (2009), p.  31.   Since there are n! (n factorial) possible permutation operations that can be performed on a tuple composed of n symbols, it follows that the order (the number of elements) of the symmetric group S n  is n!. 

Short Message Peer-to-Peer<====>28904<====>Short Message Peer-to-PeerShort Message Peer-to-Peer (SMPP) in the telecommunications industry is an open, industry standard protocol designed to provide a flexible data communication interface for the transfer of short message data between External Short Messaging Entities (ESMEs), Routing Entities (REs) and Message Centres.  Short Message Peer-to-Peer Protocol Specification v5. 0 SMPP is often used to allow third parties (e. g.  value-added service providers like news organizations) to submit messages, often in bulk, but it may be used for SMS peering as well.  SMPP is able to carry short messages including EMS, voicemail notifications, Cell Broadcasts, WAP messages including WAP Push messages (used to deliver MMS notifications), USSD messages and others. 

Strike from the record<====>28906<====>Strike from the record To strike from the record is for a judge to forbid a decision maker (such as a juror) to consider a particular piece of testimony or other evidence when deciding the case even though he or she has already learned what that evidence or testimony concerned. The commonly heard request is "move to strike", with the intent to erase previous testimony or court proceeding from record.DEFAULTSORT 

Suburb<====>28908<====>Suburb A suburb is a mixed-use or residential area, existing either as part of a city or urban area or as a separate residential community within commuting distance of a city.   In most English-speaking countries, suburban areas are defined in contrast to central or inner-city areas, but in Australian English and South African English, suburb has become largely synonymous with what is called a "neighborhood" in other countries and the term extends to inner-city areas.  In some areas, such as Australia, China, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and a few U. S.  states, new suburbs are routinely annexed by adjacent cities. 

Shōnen manga<====>28910<====>Shōnen mangais manga aimed at a teenage male target-demographic readership.  The age group varies with individual readers and different magazines, but it is primarily intended for boys between the ages of 12 to 18.  The kanji characters ( ) literally mean "boy" (or "youth"), and the characters ( ) mean "cartoon" or "comic".  Thus, the complete phrase means "young person's comic", or simply "boys' comic"; its female equivalent is shōjo manga.  Shōnen manga is the most popular form of manga.  SummaryShōnen manga is typically characterized by high-action,  often humorous plots featuring male protagonists.

The main settlement, Mol-chlach, is on the shore of Camas nan Gall. 

Storytelling game<====>28918<====>Storytelling game A storytelling game is a game where two or more persons collaborate on telling a spontaneous story.  Usually, each player takes care of one or more characters in the developing story.  Some games in the tradition of role-playing games require one participant to take the roles of the various supporting characters, as well as introducing non-character forces (for example, a flood), but other systems dispense with this figure and distribute this function among all players. Since this person usually sets the ground and setting for the story, he or she is often referred to as the "storyteller" (often contracted to "ST") or "narrator". 

Scorpion<====>28922<====>Scorpion  Scorpions are predatory arachnids of the order Scorpiones.  They have eight legs  and are easily recognized by the pair of grasping pedipalps and the narrow, segmented tail, often carried in a characteristic forward curve over the back, ending with a venomous stinger.  Scorpions range in size from 9 mm / 0. 3 in.  (Typhlochactas mitchelli) to 23 cm / 9 in.  (Heterometrus swammerdami).  The evolutionary history of scorpions goes back to the Silurian era 430 million years ago.  They have adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions and can now be found on all continents except Antarctica.

Science-fiction fandom<====>28925<====>Science-fiction fandom Science-fiction fandom or SF fandom or sci-fi fandom, is a community or fandom of people interested in science fiction in contact with one another based upon that interest.  SF fandom has a life of its own, but not much in the way of formal organization (although clubs such as the Futurians [1937–1945] is a recognized example of organized fandom). Most often called simply "fandom" within the community, it can be viewed as a distinct subculture,  with its own literature and jargon; marriages and other relationships among fans are common, as are multi-generational fan families. Origins and historyScience-fiction fandom started through the letter column of Hugo Gernsback's fiction magazines. 

Stellar classification<====>28927<====>Stellar classification In astronomy, stellar classification is the classification of stars based on their spectral characteristics.  Electromagnetic radiation from the star is analyzed by splitting it with a prism or diffraction grating into a spectrum exhibiting the rainbow of colors interspersed with spectral lines.  Each line indicates a particular chemical element or molecule, with the line strength indicating the abundance of that element.  The strengths of the different spectral lines vary mainly due to the temperature of the photosphere, although in some cases there are true abundance differences.  The spectral class of a star is a short code primarily summarizing the ionization state, giving an objective measure of the photosphere's temperature. 

SN 1987A<====>28930<====>SN 1987A  SN 1987A was a supernova in the outskirts of the Tarantula Nebula, in the Large Magellanic Cloud (a nearby dwarf galaxy).  It occurred approximately   from Earth.This was close enough to be easily visible to the naked eye and it could be seen from the Southern Hemisphere.  It was the closest observed supernova since SN 1604, which occurred in the Milky Way itself.  The light from the new supernova reached Earth on February 23, 1987.As the first supernova discovered in 1987, it was labeled "1987A". 

Standard Oil<====>28931<====>Standard Oil  Standard Oil Co.  Inc.  was an American oil producing, transporting, refining, and marketing company.  Established in 1870 by John D.  Rockefeller as a corporation in Ohio, it was the largest oil refinery in the world of its time.   Its controversial history as one of the world's first and largest multinational corporations ended in 1911, when the United States Supreme Court ruled that Standard Oil was an illegal monopoly. Standard Oil dominated the oil products market initially through horizontal integration in the refining sector, then, in later years vertical integration; the company was an innovator in the development of the business trust. 

Seismology<====>28935<====>Seismology Seismology ( ; from Ancient Greek σεισμός (seismós) meaning "earthquake" and -λογία (-logía) meaning "study of") is the scientific study of earthquakes and the propagation of elastic waves through the Earth or through other planet-like bodies.   The field also includes studies of earthquake environmental effects such as tsunamis as well as diverse seismic sources such as volcanic, tectonic, oceanic, atmospheric, and artificial processes such as explosions.   A related field that uses geology to infer information regarding past earthquakes is paleoseismology.    A recording of earth motion as a function of time is called a seismogram. 

Cyanoacrylate<====>28936<====>Cyanoacrylate  Cyanoacrylates are a family of strong fast-acting adhesives with industrial, medical, and household uses.  Cyanoacrylate adhesives have a short shelf life if not used, about one year from manufacture if unopened, and one month once opened.  They have some minor toxicity.  Cyanoacrylates include methyl 2-cyanoacrylate, ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate (commonly sold under trade names such as "Super Glue" and "Krazy Glue"™, of Toagosei), n-butyl cyanoacrylate and 2-octyl cyanoacrylate (used in medical, veterinary and first aid applications).  Octyl cyanoacrylate was developed to address toxicity concerns and to reduce skin irritation and allergic response.  Cyanoacrylate adhesives are sometimes known generically as instant glues, power glues or superglues (although "Super Glue" is a trade name). 

Shell script<====>28938<====>Shell script  A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by the Unix shell, a command-line interpreter.   The various dialects of shell scripts are considered to be scripting languages.  Typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text.  A script which sets up the environment, runs the program, and does any necessary cleanup, logging, etc.  is called a wrapper. The term is also used more generally to mean the automated mode of running an operating system shell; in specific operating systems they are called other things such as batch files (MSDos-Win95 stream, OS/2), command procedures (VMS), and shell scripts (Windows NT stream and third-party derivatives like 4NT—article is at cmd. 

Solder<====>28942<====>Solder Solder ( ,  or in North America   ) is a fusible metal alloy used to create a permanent bond between metal workpieces.  The word solder comes from the Middle English word soudur, via Old French solduree and soulder, from the Latin solidare, meaning "to make solid".   In fact, solder must be melted in order to adhere to and connect the pieces together, so a suitable alloy for use as solder will have a lower melting point than the pieces it is intended to join.  Whenever possible, the solder should also be resistant to oxidative and corrosive effects that would degrade the joint over time. 

Shōgun<====>28943<====>Shōgun   A   was the military dictator of Japan during the period from 1185 to 1868 (with exceptions).  In most of this period, the shōguns were the de facto rulers of the country, although nominally they were appointed by the Emperor as a ceremonial formality.   The shōguns held almost absolute power over territories through military means.  Nevertheless, an unusual situation occurred in the Kamakura period (1199–1333) upon the death of the first shōgun, whereby the Hōjō clan's hereditary titles of shikken (1199–1256) and tokusō (1256–1333) monopolized the shogunate as dictatorial positions, collectively known as the  . 

Short-term memory<====>28944<====>Short-term memory Short-term memory  (or "primary" or "active memory") is the capacity for holding, but not manipulating, a small amount of information in mind in an active, readily available state for a short period of time.  For example, short-term memory can be used to remember a phone number that has just been recited.  The duration of short-term memory (when rehearsal or active maintenance is prevented) is believed to be in the order of seconds.  The most commonly cited capacity is The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two (which is frequently referred to as Miller's Law), despite the fact that Miller himself stated that the figure was intended as "little more than a joke" (Miller, 1989, page 401) and that Cowan (2001) provided evidence that a more realistic figure is 4±1 units. 

State supreme court<====>28945<====>State supreme court  This article discusses the state supreme courts in the United States.  See Australian court hierarchy for the counterparts in Australian states.  See Supreme court for the highest court in a country. In the United States, a state supreme court (known by other names in some states) is the ultimate judicial tribunal in the court system of a particular state (i. e. , that  state's court of last resort).  On matters of state law, the decisions of a state supreme court are considered final and binding on state and even United States federal courts.

Southern blot<====>28957<====>Southern blotA Southern blot is a method used in molecular biology for detection of a specific DNA sequence in DNA samples.  Southern blotting combines  transfer of electrophoresis-separated DNA fragments to a filter membrane and subsequent fragment detection by probe hybridization. The method is named after the British biologist Edwin Southern who first published it in 1975.    Other blotting  methods (i. e. , western blot,  northern blot, eastern blot, southwestern blot) that employ similar principles, but using RNA or protein, have later been named in reference to Edwin Southern's name.  As the label is eponymous, Southern is capitalised, as is conventional for proper nouns. 

Standard-gauge railway<====>28961<====>Standard-gauge railway   A standard-gauge railway is a railway with a track gauge of  .  The standard gauge is also called Stephenson gauge after George Stephenson, International gauge, UIC gauge, uniform gauge, normal gauge and European gauge in the EU and Russia.  It is the most widely used railway track gauge across the world with approximately 55% of the lines in the world using it.  All high-speed rail lines, except those in Russia, Finland, Uzbekistan and Australia, utilise standard gauge.  The distance between the inside edges of the rails is defined to be 1435 mm except in the United States, where it is still defined in Imperial and US customary units as approximately 4 ft   in. 

Sodium laureth sulfate<====>28962<====>Sodium laureth sulfate  Sodium laureth sulfate (SLES), an accepted contraction of sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES), is an anionic detergent and surfactant found in many personal care products (soaps, shampoos, toothpaste etc. ).

It is the fourth largest Australian desert, with an area of 176,500 km 2  (68,100 sq mi) and is the world's largest sand dune desert.    The desert is underlain by the Great Artesian Basin, one of the largest inland drainage areas in the world.  Water from the basin rises to the surface at numerous natural springs, including Dalhousie Springs, and at bores drilled along stock routes, or during petroleum exploration. 

Silesian Voivodeship<====>28969<====>Silesian Voivodeship  Silesian Voivodeship, or Silesia Province  (   ),  ) is a voivodeship, or province, in southern Poland, centered on the historic region known as Upper Silesia ( ), with Katowice serving as its capital.  Despite the Silesian Voivodeship's name, most of the historic Silesia region lies outside the present Silesian Voivodeship — divided among Lubusz, Lower Silesian, and Opole Voivodeships — while the eastern half of Silesian Voivodeship (and, notably, Częstochowa in the north) was historically part of Lesser Poland. The Voivodeship was created on 1 January 1999 out of the former Katowice, Częstochowa and Bielsko-Biała Voivodeships, pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998. 

SECD machine<====>28970<====>SECD machineThe SECD machine is a highly influential (See: #Landin's contribution) virtual machine and abstract machine intended as a target for functional programming language compilers.   The letters stand for Stack, Environment, Control, Dump, the internal registers of the machine.   These registers point to linked lists in memory.   The machine was the first to be specifically designed to evaluate lambda calculus expressions.    It was originally described by Peter J.  Landin as part of his ISWIM programming language definition in 1963.  The description published by Landin was fairly abstract, and left many implementation choices open (like an operational semantics). 

Stratego<====>28971<====>Stratego   Stratego   is a strategy board game for two players on a board of 10×10 squares.  Each player controls 40 pieces representing individual officer ranks in an army.  The pieces have Napoleonic  .  The objective of the game is to find and capture the opponent's Flag, or to capture so many enemy pieces that the opponent cannot make any further moves.  Stratego has simple enough rules for young children to play, but a depth of strategy that is also appealing to adults.  The game is a slightly modified copy of an early 20th century French game named L'Attaque.

Super Bowl III<====>28975<====>Super Bowl III  Super Bowl III was the third AFL–NFL Championship Game in professional American football, and the first to officially bear the name "Super Bowl".The game, played on January 12, 1969, at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida, is regarded as one of the greatest upsets in American sports history.   The heavy underdog American Football League (AFL) champion New York Jets defeated the National Football League (NFL) champion Baltimore Colts by a score of 16–7. This was the first Super Bowl victory for the AFL.  Before the start of the game, most sports writers and fans believed that AFL teams were less talented than NFL clubs, and expected the Colts to defeat the Jets by a wide margin. 

Super Bowl XX<====>28976<====>Super Bowl XX  Super Bowl XX was an American football game between the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Chicago Bears and the American Football Conference (AFC) champion New England Patriots to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1985 season.  The Bears defeated the Patriots by the score of 46–10, capturing their first NFL championship (and Chicago's first overall sports victory) since 1963, three years prior to the birth of the Super Bowl.  Super Bowl XX was played on January 26, 1986 at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans.  This was the first of nine Super Bowl appearances for New England. 

Salute<====>28977<====>Salute A salute is a gesture or other action used to display respect.  Salutes are primarily associated with armed forces, but other organizations and civilians also use salutes. Military salutesIn military traditions of various times and places, there have been numerous methods of performing salutes, using hand gestures, cannon or rifle shots, hoisting of flags, removal of headgear, or other means of showing respect or deference.  In the Commonwealth of Nations, only commissioned officers are saluted, and the salute is to the commission they carry from their respective commanders-in-chief representing the Monarch, not the officers themselves. The British Army's salute is almost identical to the French salute. 

Hyoscine<====>28979<====>Hyoscine    Hyoscine, also known as scopolamine,    is a medication used to treat motion sickness and postoperative nausea and vomiting.   It is also sometimes used before surgery to decrease saliva.   When used by injection, effects begin after about 20 minutes and last for up to 8 hours.   It may also be used by mouth and as a dermal patch.Common side effects include sleepiness, blurred vision, dilated pupils, and dry mouth.   It is not recommended in people with glaucoma or bowel obstruction.   It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe; however, it appears to be safe during breastfeeding. 

Society for Creative Anachronism<====>28981<====>Society for Creative Anachronism The Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA) is an international living history group with the aim of studying and recreating mainly Medieval European cultures and their histories before the 17th century.  A quip often used within the SCA describes it as a group devoted to the Middle Ages "as they ought to have been",  choosing to "selectively recreate the culture, choosing elements of the culture that interest and attract us".Founded in 1966, the non-profit educational corporation has over 30,000 paid members with about 60,000 total participants in the society (including members and non-member participants). 

Snowball Earth<====>28982<====>Snowball Earth  The Snowball Earth hypothesis proposes that Earth's surface became entirely or nearly entirely frozen at least once, sometime earlier than 650 Mya (million years ago).  Proponents of the hypothesis argue that it best explains sedimentary deposits generally regarded as of glacial origin at tropical palaeolatitudes and other enigmatic features in the geological record.  Opponents of the hypothesis contest the implications of the geological evidence for global glaciation and the geophysical feasibility of an ice- or slush-covered ocean  and emphasize the difficulty of escaping an all-frozen condition.  A number of unanswered questions remain, including whether the Earth was a full snowball, or a "slushball" with a thin equatorial band of open (or seasonally open) water. 

S.S. Lazio<====>28984<====>S. S.  Lazio    Società Sportiva Lazio S. p.

Lazio have been Italian champions twice (1974, 2000), and have won the Coppa Italia six times, the Supercoppa Italiana four times, and both the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and UEFA Super Cup on one occasion. 

Saint Ninian<====>28990<====>Saint Ninian   Saint Ninian is a Christian saint first mentioned in the 8th century as being an early missionary among the Pictish peoples of what is now Scotland.  For this reason he is known as the Apostle to the Southern Picts, and there are numerous dedications to him in those parts of Scotland with a Pictish heritage, throughout the Scottish Lowlands, and in parts of Northern England with a Northumbrian heritage.  In Scotland, Ninian is also known as Ringan, and as Trynnian in Northern England. Ninian's major shrine was at Whithorn in Galloway, where he is associated with the Candida Casa (Latin for 'White House'). 

Standard Generalized Markup Language<====>28994<====>Standard Generalized Markup Language The Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML; ISO 8879:1986) is a standard for defining generalized markup languages for documents.  ISO 8879 Annex A. 1 defines generalized markup: Generalized markup is based on two postulates: Markup should be declarative: it should describe a document's structure and other attributes, rather than specify the processing to be performed on it.  Declarative markup is less likely to conflict with unforeseen future processing needs and techniques. Markup should be rigorous so that the techniques available for processing rigorously-defined objects like programs and databases can be used for processing documents as well. 

Speciation<====>29000<====>Speciation  Speciation is the evolutionary process by which populations evolve to become distinct species.  The biologist Orator F.  Cook coined the term in 1906 for cladogenesis, the splitting of lineages, as opposed to anagenesis, phyletic evolution within lineages.  Charles Darwin was the first to describe the role of natural selection in speciation in his 1859 book The Origin of Species.   He also identified sexual selection as a likely mechanism, but found it problematic. There are four geographic modes of speciation in nature, based on the extent to which speciating populations are isolated from one another: allopatric, peripatric, parapatric, and sympatric. 

SQL<====>29004<====>SQL   SQL (  S-Q-L,    "sequel"; Structured Query Language)is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).  In comparison to older read/write APIs like ISAM or VSAM, SQL offers two main advantages: first, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command; and second, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, e. g.  with or without an index. 

Strait of Hormuz<====>29005<====>Strait of HormuzThe Strait of Hormuz (    Tangeye Hormoz  ) is a strait between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.  It provides the only sea passage from the Persian Gulf to the open ocean and is one of the world's most strategically important choke points.  On the north coast lies Iran, and on the south coast the United Arab Emirates and Musandam, an exclave of Oman.   At its narrowest, the strait has a width of  .  About 20% of the world's petroleum (about 35% of the petroleum traded by sea) passes through the strait, making it a highly important strategic location for international trade. 

Space telescope<====>29006<====>Space telescopeA space telescope or space observatory is an instrument located in outer space to observe distant planets, galaxies and other astronomical objects.  Space telescopes avoid many of the problems of ground-based observatories, such as light pollution and distortion of electromagnetic radiation (scintillation).  In addition, ultraviolet frequencies, X-rays and gamma rays are blocked by the Earth's atmosphere, so they can only be observed from space.  Theorized by Lyman Spitzer in 1946, the first operational space telescopes were the American Orbiting Astronomical Observatory OAO-2 launched in 1968 and the Soviet Orion 1 ultraviolet telescope aboard space station Salyut 1 in 1971. 

Saint David<====>29007<====>Saint David    Saint David ( ,  ;   500589) was a Welsh bishop of Mynyw (now St Davids) during the 6th century; he was later regarded as a saint.  He is the  patron saint of Wales.  David was a native of Wales, and a relatively large amount of information is known about his life.  However, his birth date is uncertain: suggestions range from 462 to 512.He is traditionally believed to be the son of Saint Non and the grandson of Ceredig ap Cunedda, king of Ceredigion. 

Saint George<====>29010<====>Saint George  Saint George ( , Geṓrgios;  ;  ;   to 23 April 303), according to legend, was a Roman soldier of Greek origin and officer in the Guard of Roman emperor Diocletian, who was sentenced to death for failing to recant his Christian faith.  As a Christian martyr, he later became one of the most venerated saints in Christianity, and was especially venerated by the Crusaders.  George's parents were Christians of Greek background, his father Gerontius ( , Gerontios meaning "old man" in Greek) was a Roman army official from Cappadocia, and his mother Polychronia (Greek name, meaning she who lives many years) was a Christian and a Greek native "St. 

Secular humanism<====>29021<====>Secular humanism   Secular humanism is a philosophy or life stance that embraces human reason, ethics, social justice, and philosophical naturalism while specifically rejecting religious dogma, supernaturalism, pseudoscience, and superstition as the bases of morality and decision making. Secular humanism posits that human beings are capable of being ethical and moral without religion or a god.  It does not, however, assume that humans are either inherently evil or innately good, nor does it present humans as being superior to nature.  Rather, the humanist life stance emphasizes the unique responsibility facing humanity and the ethical consequences of human decisions. 

Game Gear<====>29027<====>Game Gear   The Game Gear  is an 8-bit fourth generation handheld game console released by Sega on October 6, 1990 in Japan, in   throughout North America and Europe, and during 1992 in Australia.  The Game Gear primarily competed with Nintendo's Game Boy, the Atari Lynx and NEC's TurboExpress.  The handheld shares much of its hardware with the Master System and is able to play its own titles as well as those of the Master System, the latter being made possible by the use of an adapter.  Containing a full-color backlit screen with a landscape format, Sega positioned the Game Gear as a technologically superior handheld to the Game Boy. 

32X<====>29028<====>32X   The 32X is an add-on for the Sega Genesis video game console.  Codenamed "Project Mars", the 32X was designed to expand the power of the Genesis and serve as a transitional console into the 32-bit era until the release of the Sega Saturn.  Independent of the Genesis, the 32X uses its own ROM cartridges and has its own library of games.  The add-on was distributed under the name Super 32X  in Japan, Genesis 32X in North America, Mega Drive 32X in the PAL region, and Mega 32X in Brazil. Unveiled by Sega at June 1994's Consumer Electronics Show, the 32X was presented as a low-cost option for consumers looking to play 32-bit games. 

Severan dynasty<====>29031<====>Severan dynasty  The Severan dynasty was a Roman imperial dynasty, which ruled the Roman Empire between 193 and 235.  The dynasty was founded by the Roman general Septimius Severus, who rose to power as the victor of the 193-197 civil war. Although Septimius Severus successfully restored peace following the upheaval of the late 2nd century, the dynasty was disturbed by highly unstable family relationships, as well as constant political turmoil foreshadowing the imminent Crisis of the Third Century.  It was the last lineage of the Principate founded by Augustus. HistoryFor dynastic relationships: see Severan dynasty family treeSeptimius Severus (193–211) Lucius Septimius Severus was born to a family of Phoenicia  or Berber equestrian rank in  Leptis Magna, the Roman province of Africa proconsularis, in modern-day Libya. 

Sega CD<====>29032<====>Sega CD   The Sega CD, released as the Mega-CD  in most regions outside North America, is a CD-ROM accessory for the Sega Genesis video game console designed and produced by Sega as part of the fourth generation of video game consoles.  The add-on was released on December 12, 1991 in Japan, October 15, 1992 in North America, and 1993 in Europe.  The Sega CD lets the user play CD-based games and adds extra hardware functionality, such as a faster central processing unit and graphic enhancements.  It can also play audio CDs and CD+G discs. 

Sega Pico<====>29033<====>Sega Pico  The Sega Pico, also known as  , is an educational video game console by Sega Toys.  Marketed as "edutainment", the main focus of the Pico was educational video games for children between 3 and 7 years old.  The Pico was released in June 1993 in Japan and November 1994 in North America and Europe, later reaching China.  It was succeeded by the Advanced Pico Beena, which was released in Japan in 2005.  Though the Pico was sold continuously in Japan through the release of the Beena, in North America and Europe the Pico was less successful and was discontinued in early 1998, later being rereleased by Majesco Entertainment. 

Sega VR<====>29034<====>Sega VR  The  Sega VR is a virtual reality headset that was under development by Sega.  Versions were planned for arcades and consoles (Sega Genesis and then Saturn), but only the arcade version was released, while the home console versions were cancelled. FeaturesThe Sega VR was based on an IDEO virtual reality headset (HMD) with LCD screens in the visor and stereo headphones.   Inertial sensors in the headset allowed the system to track and react to the movements of the user's head. DevelopmentSega, flush with funds from the success of its Sega Genesis (released as the Mega Drive outside of North America), announced the device in 1991. 

Sega Saturn<====>29035<====>Sega Saturn   The Sega Saturn  is a 32-bit fifth-generation home video game console that was developed by Sega and released on November 22, 1994 in Japan, May 11, 1995 in North America, and July 8, 1995 in Europe.  The successor to the successful Sega Genesis, the Saturn has a dual-CPU architecture and eight processors.  Its games are in CD-ROM format, and its game library contains several arcade ports as well as original games. Development of the Saturn began in 1992, the same year Sega's groundbreaking 3D Model 1 arcade hardware debuted.  Designed around a new CPU from Japanese electronics company Hitachi, another video display processor was incorporated into the system's design in early 1994 to better compete with Sony's forthcoming PlayStation. 

Dreamcast<====>29036<====>Dreamcast    The Dreamcast  is a home video game console released by Sega on November 27, 1998 in Japan, September 9, 1999 in North America, and October 14, 1999 in Europe.  It was the first in the sixth generation of video game consoles, preceding Sony's PlayStation 2, Nintendo's GameCube and Microsoft's Xbox.  The Dreamcast was Sega's final home console, marking the end of the company's 18 years in the console market. In contrast to the expensive hardware of the unsuccessful Sega Saturn, the Dreamcast was designed to reduce costs with "off-the-shelf" components, including a Hitachi SH-4 CPU and an NEC PowerVR2 GPU.

SH3 domain<====>29039<====>SH3 domain The SRC Homology 3 Domain  (or SH3 domain)  is a small protein domain of about 60 amino acid residues.  Initially, SH3 was described as a conserved sequence in the viral adaptor protein v-Crk.  This domain is also present in the molecules of phospholipase and several cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases such as Abl and Src.   It has also been identified in several other protein families such as: PI3 Kinase, Ras GTPase-activating protein, CDC24 and cdc25. SH3 domains are found in proteins of signaling pathways regulating the cytoskeleton, the Ras protein, and the Src kinase and many others. 

Stokes' theorem<====>29040<====>Stokes' theorem  In vector calculus, and more generally differential geometry, Stokes' theorem (also called the generalized Stokes theorem or the Stokes–Cartan theorem ) is a statement about the integration of differential forms on manifolds, which both simplifies and generalizes several theorems from vector calculus.   Stokes' theorem says that the integral of a differential form   over the boundary of some orientable manifold   is equal to the integral of its exterior derivative   over the whole of  , i. e. , \int_{\partial \Omega}\omega=\int_\Omega d\omega\,.  Stokes' theorem was formulated in its modern form by Élie Cartan  following earlier work on the generalization of the theorems of vector calculus by Vito Volterra, Édouard Goursat, and Henri Poincaré. 

Superfetation<====>29042<====>SuperfetationSuperfetation (also spelled superfoetation and superfœtation – see fetus) is the simultaneous occurrence of more than one stage of developing offspring in the same animal.   It is not believed that it occurs naturally in humans.  In mammals, it manifests as the formation of an embryo from a different estrous cycle while another embryo or fetus is already present in the uterus.  When two separate instances of fertilisation occur during the same menstrual cycle, it is known as superfecundation. Superfetation is claimed to be common in some species of animals.  In mammals, it can occur only where there are two uteri, or where the estrous cycle continues through pregnancy. 

Steenbeck<====>29043<====>Steenbeck Steenbeck is a company that manufactures flatbed editors.   Steenbeck is brand name that has become synonymous with a type of flatbed film editing suite which is usable with both 16 mm and 35 mm optical sound and magnetic sound film.  The Steenbeck company was founded in 1931 by Wilhelm Steenbeck in Hamburg, Germany.  Since then, the name Steenbeck has become widely known in the film editing community  and more than 25,000 machines are in operation around the world.   The company relocated to Venray (The Netherlands) in September 2003, where it still manufactures editing tables. 

Speciesism<====>29045<====>Speciesism  Speciesism ( ) involves the assignment of different values, rights, or special consideration to individuals solely on the basis of their species membership.  The term is sometimes used by animal rights advocates, who argue that speciesism is a prejudice similar to racism or sexism, in that the treatment of individuals is predicated on group membership and morally irrelevant physical differences.  Their claim is that species membership has no moral significance.  The term has not been used uniformly, but broadly embraces two ideas.   It usually refers to "human speciesism" (human supremacism), the exclusion of all nonhuman animals from the rights, freedoms, and protections afforded to humans. 

Steelman language requirements<====>29047<====>Steelman language requirementsThe Steelman language requirements were a set of requirements which a high-level general-purpose programming language should meet, created by the United States Department of Defense in The Department of Defense Common High Order Language program in 1978.  The predecessors of this document were called, in order, "Strawman", "Woodenman", "Tinman" and "Ironman". The requirements focused on the needs of embedded computer applications, and emphasised reliability, maintainability, and efficiency.  Notably, they included exception handling facilities, run-time checking, and parallel computing. It was concluded that no existing language met these criteria to a sufficient extent, so a contest was called to create a language that would be closer to fulfilling them. 

Single-sideband modulation<====>29048<====>Single-sideband modulation  In radio communications, single-sideband modulation (SSB) or single-sideband suppressed-carrier modulation (SSB-SC) is a type of modulation, used to transmit information, an audio signal, by radio waves.   A refinement of amplitude modulation, it uses transmitter power and bandwidth more efficiently.  Amplitude modulation produces an output signal that has twice the bandwidth of the original baseband signal.  Single-sideband modulation avoids this bandwidth doubling, and the power wasted on a carrier, at the cost of increased device complexity and more difficult tuning at the receiver. Basic conceptRadio transmitters work by mixing a radio frequency (RF) signal of a specific frequency, the carrier wave, with the signal to be broadcast. 

Szlachta<====>29050<====>Szlachta The szlachta ( , exonym: Nobility) was a legally privileged noble class in the Kingdom of Poland, Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Ruthenia, Samogitia (both after Union of Lublin became a single state, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth) and the Zaporozhian Host.    It originated and gained considerable institutional privileges between 1333 and 1370 in Kingdom of Poland during the reign of King Casimir III the Great. In 1413, following a series of tentative personal unions between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Crown Kingdom of Poland, the existing Lithuanian-Ruthenian nobility  formally joined this class. 

Syntactic sugar<====>29054<====>Syntactic sugarIn computer science, syntactic sugar  is syntax within a programming language that is designed to make things easier to read or to express.  It makes the language "sweeter" for human use: things can be expressed more clearly, more concisely, or in an alternative style that some may prefer. For example, many programming languages provide special syntax for referencing and updating array elements.  Abstractly, an array reference is a procedure of two arguments: an array and a subscript vector, which could be expressed as  get_array(Array, vector(i,j)) .  Instead, many languages provide syntax like  Array[i,j] . 

Sonic the Hedgehog (character)<====>29056<====>Sonic the Hedgehog (character)   is the title character and protagonist of the Sonic the Hedgehog series released by Sega, as well as numerous spin-off comics, five animated shows, and an animated OVA. Sonic is a blue anthropomorphic hedgehog who has the ability to run at supersonic speeds and the ability to curl into a ball, primarily to attack enemies.  Throughout the course of the video games, Sonic most commonly has to race through levels, collect power up rings and survive against a host of natural obstacles and minions to achieve his goal. 

Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union<====>29062<====>Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union  The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union ( ) was the highest legislative body in the Soviet Union  and the only one with the power to pass constitutional amendments.  It elected the Presidium serving as the collective head of state of the Soviet Union,  formed the Council of Ministers and the Supreme Court, and appointed the Procurator General of the Soviet Union. StructureThe Supreme Soviet was made up of two chambers, each with equal legislative powers, with members elected for four-year terms: Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd edition, entry on "Верховный Совет СССР", available online here The Soviet of the Union, elected on the basis of population with one deputy for every 300,000 people in the Soviet federationThe Soviet of Nationalities, supposed to represent the ethnic populations, with members elected on the basis of 32 deputies from each union republic, 11 from each autonomous republic, five from each autonomous oblast (region), and one from each autonomous okrug (district). 

Satyr<====>29067<====>Satyr    In Greek mythology, a satyr ( ,  ;,   ) is the member of a troop of ithyphallic male companions of Dionysus; they usually have horse-like ears and tails, as well as permanent, exaggerated erections.   Early artistic representations sometimes include horse-like legs, but, in 6th-century BC black-figure pottery, human legs are the most common.   The faun is a similar woodland-dwelling creature from Roman mythology, which had the body of a man, but the legs, horns, and tail of a goat.  Branham (1997) p.  xxiii  In myths, both are often associated with pipe-playing. 

Sturgeon-class submarine<====>29068<====>Sturgeon-class submarine }   The Sturgeon class (known colloquially in naval circles as the 637 class) was a class of nuclear-powered fast attack submarines (SSN) in service with the United States Navy from the 1960s until 2004.  They were the "workhorses" of the Navy's attack submarine fleet throughout much of the Cold War.   The boats were phased out in the 1990s and early 21st century, as their successors, the  , followed by the   and  -class boats, entered service. DesignThe Sturgeons were essentially lengthened and improved variants of the Thresher/Permit class that directly preceded them. 

Seawolf-class submarine<====>29069<====>Seawolf-class submarine Seawolf class}   The Seawolf class is a class of nuclear-powered fast attack submarines (SSN) in service with the United States Navy.  The class was the intended successor to the  .  Design work began in 1983.   At one time, an intended fleet of 29 submarines was to be built over a ten-year period, later reduced to twelve submarines.  The end of the Cold War and budget constraints led to the cancellation in 1995 of any further additions to the fleet, leaving the Seawolf class limited to just three boats.  This, in turn, led to the design of the smaller  .

Sun Myung Moon<====>29074<====>Sun Myung Moon   Sun Myung Moon (Korean 문선명 Mun Seon-myeong; born Mun Yong-myeong; 25 February 1920 – 3 September 2012 ) was a Korean religious leader, also known for his business ventures and support of social and political causes.   A messiah claimant, he was the founder of the  Unification Church (members of which considered him and his wife Hak Ja Han to be their "True Parents"),  and of its widely noted "Blessing" or mass wedding ceremony, and the author of its unique theology the Divine Principle.  Moon’s death marks end of an era, Eileen Barker, CNN, 2012-9-3, Although Moon is likely to be remembered for all these things – mass weddings, accusations of brainwashing, political intrigue and enormous wealth – he should also be remembered as creating what was arguably one of the most comprehensive and innovative theologies embraced by a new religion of the period. 

Statute of frauds<====>29079<====>Statute of frauds The statute of frauds refers to the requirement that certain kinds of contracts be memorialized in a writing, signed by the party to be charged, with sufficient content to evidence the contract.   Traditionally, the statute of frauds requires a signed writing in the following circumstances:Contracts in consideration of marriage.  This provision covers prenuptial agreements. Contracts that cannot be performed within one year.  However, contracts of indefinite duration do not fall under the statute of frauds regardless of how long the performance actually takes. Contracts for the transfer of an interest in land.  This applies not only to a contract to sell land but also to any other contract in which land or an interest in it is disposed, such as the grant of a mortgage or an easement. 

Sovereign immunity<====>29081<====>Sovereign immunity Sovereign immunity, or crown immunity, is a legal doctrine by which the sovereign or state cannot commit a legal wrong and is immune from civil suit or criminal prosecution.   It is a principle of international law which exempts a sovereign state from the jurisdiction of foreign national courts.  Sovereign immunity is based on the concept of sovereignty in the sense that a sovereign may not be subjected without its approval to the jurisdiction of another sovereign.  As Lord Atkin observed, The courts of a country will not impede a foreign sovereign, that is, they will not by their process make him against his will a party to legal proceedings whether the proceedings involve process against his person or seek to recover from him specific property or damages. 

Social geography<====>29082<====>Social geographySocial geography is the branch of human geography that is most closely related to social theory in general and sociology in particular, dealing with the relation of social phenomena and its spatial components.  Though the term itself has a tradition of more than 100 years, Dunbar, Gary S.  (1977): Some Early Occurrences of the Term "Social Geography".  Scottish Geographical Journal 93 (1): 15-20.   there is no consensus on its explicit content.   In 1968, Anne Buttimer noted that "[w]ith some notable exceptions, (. . . ) social geography can be considered a field created and cultivated by a number of individual scholars rather than an academic tradition built up within particular schools". 

Segway PT<====>29083<====>Segway PT The Segway PT (originally Segway HT) is a two-wheeled, self-balancing scooter by Segway Inc.  Invented by Dean Kamen and launched in 2001, PT is an abbreviation for personal transporter, a term now used generally for small electric portable transport devices.  HT is an initialism for 'human transporter'. HistoryIndependent companyThe Segway PT (referred to at the time as the Segway HT) was developed from the self-balancing iBOT wheelchair which was initially developed at University of Plymouth, in conjunction with BAE Systems and Sumitomo Precision Products.Segway's first patent was filed in 1994 and granted in 1997  followed by others  including one submitted in June 1999 and granted in October 2001. 

Slayers<====>29084<====>Slayersis a Japanese light novel series written by Hajime Kanzaka and illustrated by Rui Araizumi.  The novels had been serialized in Dragon Magazine, and were later adapted into several manga titles, anime television series, anime films, OVA series, role-playing video games, and other media.  Slayers follows the adventures of teenage sorceress Lina Inverse and her companions as they journey through their world.    Using powerful magic and swordsmanship they battle overreaching wizards, demons seeking to destroy the world, and an occasional hapless gang of bandits. 

Security through obscurity<====>29087<====>Security through obscurityIn security engineering, security through obscurity (or security by obscurity) is the reliance on the secrecy of the design or implementation as the main method of providing security for a system or component of a system.  A system or component relying on obscurity may have theoretical or actual security vulnerabilities, but its owners or designers believe that if the flaws are not known, that will be sufficient to prevent a successful attack.  Security experts have rejected this view as far back as 1851, and advise that obscurity should never be the only security mechanism. HistoryAn early opponent of security through obscurity was the locksmith Alfred Charles Hobbs, who in 1851 demonstrated to the public how state-of-the-art locks could be picked and who, in response to concerns that exposing security flaws in the design of locks could make them more vulnerable to criminals, said "Rogues are very keen in their profession, and know already much more than we can teach them. 

Snuff film<====>29089<====>Snuff film  A snuff film, or snuff movie, is "a movie in a purported genre of movies in which a person is actually murdered or commits suicide".   It may include a motion picture genre that depicts the actual murder of a person or people, without the aid of special effects, for the express purpose of financial exploitation, but that detail is extraneous, so long as it is "circulated amongst a jaded few for the purpose of entertainment".   Some filmed records of executions and murders exist, but these were not staged for commercial purposes.The case of Australian paedophile Peter Scully revealed that he was selling films of himself torturing and raping children on the dark web, but these films did not show him murdering the victims. 

Software testing<====>29090<====>Software testing  Software testing is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the software product or service under test.Software testing can also provide an objective, independent view of the software to allow the business to appreciate and understand the risks of software implementation.  Test techniques include the process of executing a program or application with the intent of finding software bugs (errors or other defects), and verifying that the software product is fit for use. Software testing involves the execution of a software component or system component to evaluate one or more properties of interest. 

Ship-Submarine Recycling Program<====>29091<====>Ship-Submarine Recycling ProgramThe Ship/Submarine Recycling Program (SRP) is the process that the United States Navy uses to dispose of decommissioned nuclear vessels.   SRP takes place only at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNS) in Bremerton, Washington, but the preparations can begin elsewhere. Program overviewDefueling and decommissioningBefore SRP can begin, the vessel's nuclear fuel must be removed, and defueling usually coincides with decommissioning.  Until the fuel is removed, the vessel is referred to as "USS Name," but afterward the "USS" is dropped and it is referred to as "ex-Name. " Defueling of submarines is carried out at only five ship repair facilities on the West Coast, and the hulls are then towed to PSNS. 

Shaolin Monastery<====>29098<====>Shaolin Monastery   The Shaolin Monastery ( ), also known as the Shaolin Temple, is a Chan ("Zen") Buddhist temple in Dengfeng County, Henan Province, China.   Dating back 1,500 years when founded by Fang Lu-Hao, Shaolin Temple is the main temple of the Shaolin school of Buddhism to this day. Shaolin Monastery and its Pagoda Forest were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2010 as part of the "Historic Monuments of Dengfeng".  History EstablishmentThe name refers to the forests  of Shaoshi ( ) mountain, one of the seven peaks of the Song mountains. 

Seymour Cray<====>29103<====>Seymour Cray Seymour Roger Cray (September 28, 1925  – October 5, 1996 Obituary - Seymour Cray, Father of supercomputing    ) was an American electrical engineer and supercomputer architect who designed a series of computers that were the fastest in the world for decades, and founded Cray Research which built many of these machines.  Called "the father of supercomputing,"  Cray has been credited with creating the supercomputer industry.   Joel S.  Birnbaum, then chief technology officer of Hewlett-Packard, said of him: "It seems impossible to exaggerate the effect he had on the industry; many of the things that high performance computers now do routinely were at the farthest edge of credibility when Seymour envisioned them. 

Signature block<====>29105<====>Signature block  A signature block (often abbreviated as signature, sig block, sig file, . sig, dot sig, siggy, or just sig) is a block of text automatically appended at the bottom of an email message, Usenet article, or forum post. Email and UsenetAn email signature is a block of text appended to the end of an email message often containing the sender's name, address, phone number, disclaimer or other contact information. "Traditional" internet cultural . sig practices assume the use of monospaced ASCII text because they pre-date MIME and the use of HTML in email.  In this tradition, it is common practice for a signature block to consist of one or more lines containing some brief information on the author of the message such as phone number and email address, URLs for sites owned or favoured by the author - but also often a quotation (occasionally automatically generated by such tools as fortune), or an ASCII art picture. 

Semantics<====>29107<====>Semantics  Semantics (from   sēmantikos, "significant")   is the linguistic and philosophical study of meaning, in language, programming languages, formal logics, and semiotics.  It is concerned with the relationship between signifiers—like words, phrases, signs, and symbols—and what they stand for, their denotation. In international scientific vocabulary semantics is also called semasiology.  The word semantics was first used by Michel Bréal, a French philologist.   It denotes a range of ideas—from the popular to the highly technical.  It is often used in ordinary language for denoting a problem of understanding that comes down to word selection or connotation. 

Semantic network<====>29109<====>Semantic network A semantic network, or frame network,  is a network that represents semantic relations between concepts.  This is often used as a form of knowledge representation.  It is a directed or undirected graph consisting of vertices, which represent concepts, and edges, which represent semantic relations between concepts.  Typical standardized semantic networks are expressed as semantic triples. History"Semantic Nets" were first invented for computers by Richard H.  Richens of the Cambridge Language Research Unit in 1956 as an "interlingua" for machine translation of natural languages.  They were independently developed by Robert F.  Simmons,    Sheldon Klein, Karen McConologue, M. 

Stockholm Bloodbath<====>29113<====>Stockholm Bloodbath The Stockholm Bloodbath (Swedish: Stockholms blodbad, Danish: Det Stockholmske Blodbad) took place on the invasion of Sweden by Danish forces under the command of King Christian II.  The bloodbath was a series of events taking place between 7 and 9 November 1520, climaxing on 8 November, when around 80–90 people (mostly nobility and clergy supporting the Sture party) were executed, despite a promise by King Christian for general amnesty. BackgroundPolitical factions in SwedenThe Stockholm Bloodbath was a consequence of conflict between Swedish pro-unionists (in favour of the Kalmar Union, then dominated by Denmark) and anti-unionists (supporters of Swedish independence), and also between the anti-unionists and the Danish aristocracy, which in other aspects was opposed to King Christian. 

Signals intelligence<====>29122<====>Signals intelligence  Signals intelligence (SIGINT) is intelligence-gathering by interception of signals, whether communications between people (communications intelligence—abbreviated to COMINT) or from electronic signals not directly used in communication (electronic intelligence—abbreviated to ELINT).  Signals intelligence is a subset of intelligence collection management. As sensitive information is often encrypted, signals intelligence in turn involves the use of cryptanalysis to decipher the messages.   Traffic analysis—the study of who is signaling whom and in what quantity—is also used to derive information. HistoryOrigins Electronic interception appeared as early as 1900, during the Boer War of 1899-1902.  The British Royal Navy had installed wireless sets produced by Marconi on board their ships in the late 1890s and the British Army used some limited wireless signalling. 

Semantic Web<====>29123<====>Semantic WebThe Semantic Web is an extension of the World Wide Web through standards by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).   The standards promote common data formats and exchange protocols on the Web, most fundamentally the Resource Description Framework (RDF). According to the W3C, "The Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application, enterprise, and community boundaries".   The term was coined by Tim Berners-Lee for a web of data that can be processed by machines —that is, one in which much of the meaning is machine-readable.  While its critics have questioned its feasibility, proponents argue that applications in industry, biology and human sciences research have already proven the validity of the original concept. 

Soviet submarine K-219<====>29124<====>Soviet submarine K-219 }   K-219 was a Project 667A Navaga-class ballistic missile submarine (NATO reporting name Yankee I) of the Soviet Navy.  She carried 16 (later 15) SS-N-6 liquid-fuel missiles powered by UDMH with IRFNA, equipped with an estimated 34 nuclear warheads.  K-219 was involved in what has become one of the most controversial submarine incidents during the Cold War. The incidentPreambleOn Friday 3 October 1986, while on an otherwise routine Cold War nuclear deterrence patrol in the North Atlantic   northeast of Bermuda, the 15-year-old K-219 suffered an explosion and fire in a missile tube. 

Soviet submarine K-8<====>29125<====>Soviet submarine K-8 }   K-8 was a   of the Soviet Northern Fleet that sank in the Bay of Biscay with its nuclear weapons on board on April 12, 1970.  A fire on April 8 had disabled the submarine and it was being towed in rough seas.  Fifty-two crewmen were killed attempting the salvage of the boat when it sank. Accidents1960 loss of coolantOn 13 October 1960, while operating in the Barents Sea, K-8 suffered a ruptured steam generator tube, causing a loss-of-coolant accident.  While the crew jury-rigged a system to supply emergency cooling water to the reactor, preventing a reactor core meltdown, large amounts of radioactive gas leaked out which contaminated the entire vessel. 

Soviet submarine K-19<====>29126<====>Soviet submarine K-19  }   K-19 was one of the first two Soviet submarines of the Project 658 class (NATO reporting name  ), the first generation nuclear submarine equipped with nuclear ballistic missiles, specifically the R-13 SLBM.  The boat was hurriedly built by the Soviets, who were anxious to catch up with the United States' lead in nuclear submarines.  Before it was launched, 10 civilian workers and a sailor died due to accidents and fires.  After it was commissioned, it was plagued with breakdowns and accidents, several of which threatened to sink the sub. 

List of Seleucid rulers<====>29127<====>List of Seleucid rulers  The Seleucid dynasty or the Seleucidae (from  ,  ) was a Greek Macedonian royal family, founded by Seleucus I Nicator ("the Victor"), which ruled the Seleucid Empire centered in the Near East and regions of the Asian part of the earlier Achaemenid Persian Empire during the Hellenistic period. BackgroundSeleucus (ca.  358 – 281 BCE) served as an officer of Alexander the Great, commanding the élite infantry corps in the Macedonian army: the "Shield-bearers" (Hypaspistai), later known as the "Silvershields" (Ἀργυράσπιδες / Argyraspides).   After the death of Alexander in 323 BCE, the Partition of Triparadisus assigned Seleucus as satrap of Babylon in 321 BCE. 

Super Bowl I<====>29128<====>Super Bowl I The first AFL-NFL World Championship Game in professional American football, known retroactively as Super Bowl I and referred to in some contemporaneous reports, including the game's radio broadcast, as the Super Bowl,  was played on January 15, 1967 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, California.  The National Football League (NFL) champion Green Bay Packers defeated the American Football League (AFL) champion Kansas City Chiefs by the score of 35–10. Coming into this game, considerable animosity existed between the AFL and NFL, thus the teams representing the two rival leagues (Kansas City and Green Bay, respectively) felt pressure to win. 

Super Bowl II<====>29129<====>Super Bowl II  The second AFL-NFL World Championship Game in professional football, known retrospectively as Super Bowl II, was played on January 14, 1968, at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida.  The National Football League (NFL)'s defending champion Green Bay Packers defeated the American Football League (AFL) champion Oakland Raiders by the score of 33–14. Coming into this game, like during the first Super Bowl, many sports writers and fans believed that any team in the NFL was vastly superior to any club in the AFL.  The Packers, the defending champions, posted a 9–4–1 record during the 1967 NFL season before defeating the Dallas Cowboys, 21–17, in the 1967 NFL Championship Game (also popularly known as the Ice Bowl). 

Super Bowl IV<====>29130<====>Super Bowl IV   Super Bowl IV, the fourth and final AFL-NFL World Championship Game in professional American football, was played on January 11, 1970, at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans, Louisiana.  The American Football League (AFL) champion Kansas City Chiefs defeated the National Football League (NFL) champion Minnesota Vikings by the score of 23–7.  This victory by the AFL squared the Super Bowl series with the NFL at two games apiece.  The two leagues merged into one after the season. Despite the AFL's New York Jets winning the previous season's Super Bowl, many sports writers and fans thought it was a fluke and continued to believe that the NFL was still superior to the AFL, and thus fully expected the Vikings to defeat the Chiefs; the Vikings entered the Super Bowl as 12.

Saints Cyril and Methodius<====>29161<====>Saints Cyril and Methodius  Saints Cyril and Methodius (826–869, 815–885;  ; Old Church Slavonic:   ) were two brothers who were Byzantine Christian theologians and Christian missionaries.  Through their work they influenced the cultural development of all Slavs, for which they received the title "Apostles to the Slavs".  They are credited with devising the Glagolitic alphabet, the first alphabet used to transcribe Old Church Slavonic.   After their deaths, their pupils continued their missionary work among other Slavs.  Both brothers are venerated in the Orthodox Church as saints with the title of "equal-to-apostles". 

Saluki<====>29162<====>Saluki The Saluki, also known as Persian Greyhound or Tazi, is a dog originally bred in the Fertile Crescent.   The Saluki is classed as a sighthound and is typically deep-chested and long-legged.   Salukis are "sight" hounds—hunting by sight—and run their quarry down to kill or retrieve it.  Historically, Salukis were used for hunting by nomadic tribes of Persia.  Typical quarry included the gazelle, hare, fox and jackal.  NameThe two ancient Sumerian words "Salu-ki" translate into "plunge-earth. "  However, there is no evidence the breed was referred to by the Sumerians with this name nor what "plunge to earth" might have meant in reference to the Saluki. 

Sighthound<====>29163<====>SighthoundSighthounds, also called gazehounds,  primarily hunt by sight and speed, rather than by scent and endurance as scent hounds do. Appearance  These dogs specialize in pursuing prey, keeping it in sight, and overpowering it by their great speed and agility.  They must be able to detect motion quickly, so they have keen vision.  Sighthounds must be able to capture fast, agile prey such as deer and hare, so they have a very flexible back and long legs for a long stride, a deep chest to support an unusually (compared to other dogs) large heart, very efficient lungs for both anaerobic and aerobic sprints, and a lean, wiry body to keep their weight at a minimum. 

Scottish Deerhound<====>29164<====>Scottish DeerhoundThe Scottish Deerhound, or simply the Deerhound, is a large breed of hound (a sighthound), once bred to hunt the Red Deer by coursing. HistoryThe Scottish Deerhound's antecedents existed back to a time before recorded history.  They would have been kept by the Scots and Picts, and used to help in providing part of their diet, mainly hoofed game.  Archaeological evidence likely supports this in the form of Roman pottery from around 1st Century AD found in Argyll which depicts the deerhunt using large rough hounds (these can be viewed at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh). 

Sloughi<====>29165<====>SloughiThe Sloughi    is a North African breed of dog, specifically a member of the sighthound family.

Galgo Español<====>29166<====>Galgo EspañolThe Galgo Español (Spanish galgo) or Spanish greyhound is an ancient breed of dog, specifically a member of the sighthound family. The English greyhound is possibly a descendant of the Spanish greyhound and, for several years in the 20th century, some breeders did cross-breed Galgos and Greyhounds in order to produce faster and more powerful Galgos, specifically for track racing purposes. DescriptionAppearanceGalgos are similar in appearance to Greyhounds, but are distinctly different in their conformation.  Galgos are higher in the rear than in the front, and have flatter muscling than a Greyhound, which is characteristic of endurance runners.

Social class<====>29174<====>Social class  A social class is a set of subjectively defined concepts in the social sciences and political theory centered on models of social stratification in which people are grouped into a set of hierarchical social categories,  the most common being the upper, middle and lower classes. "Class" is a subject of analysis for sociologists, political scientists, anthropologists and social historians.  However, there is not a consensus on a definition of  "class" and the term has a wide range of sometimes conflicting meanings.  In common parlance, the term "social class" is usually synonymous with "socio-economic class", defined as "people having the same social, economic, cultural, political or educational status", e.

Spaghetti Western<====>29177<====>Spaghetti Western Spaghetti Western, also known as Italian Western or Macaroni Western (primarily in Japan),    is a broad subgenre of Western films that emerged in the mid-1960s in the wake of Sergio Leone's film-making style and international box-office success.   The term was used by American critics and other countries because most of these Westerns were produced and directed by Italians.  According to veteran Spaghetti Western actor Aldo Sambrell, the phrase 'Spaghetti Western' was coined by Spanish journalist Alfonso Sánchez.   The denomination for these films in Italy is western all'italiana (Italian-style Western).  Italo-Western is also used, especially in Germany.

Assuming the role of a nameless hacker, the player attempts to hinder the plans of a malevolent artificial intelligence called SHODAN. System Shock  3D engine, physics simulation and complex gameplay have been cited as both innovative and influential.  The developers sought to build on the emergent gameplay and immersive environments of their previous games, Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss and Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds, by streamlining their mechanics into a more "integrated whole". 

Spherical coordinate system<====>29181<====>Spherical coordinate system In mathematics, a spherical coordinate system is a coordinate system for three-dimensional space where the position of a point is specified by three numbers: the radial distance of that point from a fixed origin, its polar angle measured from a fixed zenith direction, and the azimuth angle of its orthogonal projection on a reference plane that passes through the origin and is orthogonal to the zenith, measured from a fixed reference direction on that plane.  It can be seen as the three-dimensional version of the polar coordinate system.  The radial distance is also called the radius or radial coordinate. 

GAM-87 Skybolt<====>29185<====>GAM-87 Skybolt  The Douglas GAM-87 Skybolt (AGM-48 under the 1962 Tri-service system) was an air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM) developed by the United States during the late 1950s.  The basic concept was to allow US strategic bombers to launch their weapons from well outside the range of Soviet defenses, as much as   from their targets.  To do this in an air-launched form, a lightweight thermonuclear warhead was needed, initially selecting the W47 from the Polaris missile, but later moving to the W59 from the Minuteman missile. The UK joined the Skybolt program in 1960, intending to use it on their V bomber force. 

Strategic Defense Initiative<====>29186<====>Strategic Defense Initiative  The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) was a proposed missile defense system intended to protect the United States from attack by ballistic strategic nuclear weapons (intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched ballistic missiles).  The concept was first announced publicly by President Ronald Reagan on 23 March 1983.  Federation of American Scientists.  Missile Defense Milestones   Accessed March 10, 2007.   Reagan was a vocal critic of the doctrine of mutual assured destruction (MAD), which he described a "suicide pact", and he called upon the scientists and engineers of the United States to develop a system that would render nuclear weapons obsolete. 

Solomon Northup<====>29190<====>Solomon Northup Solomon Northup (July 10, 1807 or 1808 –  )was an American abolitionist and the primary author of the memoir Twelve Years a Slave.  A free-born African American from New York, he was the son of a freed slave and a free woman of color.  A farmer and a professional violinist, Northup had been a landowner in Hebron, New York.  In 1841, he was offered a traveling musician's job and went to Washington, D. C.  (where slavery was legal); there he was drugged, kidnapped, and sold as a slave.  He was shipped to New Orleans, purchased by a planter, and held as a slave for 12 years in the Red River region of Louisiana, mostly in Avoyelles Parish. 

Space elevator<====>29192<====>Space elevator  A space elevator is a proposed type of space transportation system.    The main component would be a cable (also called a tether) anchored to the surface and extending into space.  The design would permit vehicles to travel along the cable from a planetary surface, such as the Earth's, directly into space or orbit, without the use of large rockets.  An Earth-based space elevator would consist of a cable with one end attached to the surface near the equator and the other end in space beyond geostationary orbit (35,786 km altitude).  The competing forces of gravity, which is stronger at the lower end, and the outward/upward centrifugal force, which is stronger at the upper end, would result in the cable being held up, under tension, and stationary over a single position on Earth.

Systems theory<====>29238<====>Systems theorySystems theory is the interdisciplinary study of systems.  A system is a cohesive conglomeration of interrelated and interdependent parts that is either natural or man-made.  Every system is delineated by its spatial and temporal boundaries, surrounded and influenced by its environment, described by its structure and purpose or nature and expressed in its functioning.  In terms of its effects, a system can be more than the sum of its parts if it expresses synergy or emergent behavior.  Changing one part of the system usually affects other parts and the whole system, with predictable patterns of behavior.

Space colonization<====>29248<====>Space colonization  Space colonization (also called space settlement, or extraterrestrial colonization) is permanent human habitation off the planet Earth. Many arguments have been made for and against space colonization.   The two most common in favor of colonization are survival of human civilization and the biosphere in the event of a planetary-scale disaster (natural or man-made), and the availability of additional resources in space that could enable expansion of human society.  The most common objections to colonization include concerns that the commodification of the cosmos may be likely to enhance the interests of the already powerful, including major economic and military institutions, and to exacerbate pre-existing detrimental processes such as wars, economic inequality, and environmental degradation.

Relationship between religion and science<====>29266<====>Relationship between religion and scienceThe relationship between religion and science has been a subject of study since classical antiquity, addressed by philosophers, theologians, scientists, and others.  Perspectives from different geographical regions, cultures and historical epochs are diverse, with some characterizing the relationship as one of conflict, others describing it as one of harmony, and others proposing little interaction. Both science and religion are complex social and cultural endeavors that vary across cultures and have changed over time.   Most scientific and technical innovations prior to the scientific revolution were achieved by societies organized by religious traditions.  Elements of the scientific method were pioneered by ancient pagan, Islamic, and Christian scholars. 

Stephen Sondheim<====>29268<====>Stephen Sondheim  Stephen Joshua Sondheim ( ; born March 22, 1930) is an American composer and lyricist known for more than a half-century of contributions to musical theater.  Sondheim has received an Academy Award, eight Tony Awards (more than any other composer,  including a Special Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Theatre), eight Grammy Awards, a Pulitzer Prize, a Laurence Olivier Award, and a 2015 Presidential Medal of Freedom.  He has been described by Frank Rich of The New York Times as "now the greatest and perhaps best-known artist in the American musical theater. "  His best-known works as composer and lyricist include A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, Company, Follies, A Little Night Music, Pacific Overtures, Sweeney Todd, Merrily We Roll Along, Sunday in the Park with George, Into the Woods, Assassins, and Passion. 

Self-determination<====>29269<====>Self-determination The right of people to self-determination is a cardinal principle in modern international law (commonly regarded as a jus cogens rule), binding, as such, on the United Nations as authoritative interpretation of the Charter's norms.    It states that a people, based on respect for the principle of equal rights and fair equality of opportunity, have the right to freely choose their sovereignty and international political status with no interference.  The concept was first expressed in the 1860s, and spread rapidly thereafter.  During and after World War I, the principle was encouraged by both Vladimir Lenin and United States President Woodrow Wilson. 

Southcentral Alaska<====>29275<====>Southcentral AlaskaSouthcentral Alaska is the portion of the U. S.  state of Alaska consisting of the shorelines and uplands of the central Gulf of Alaska.   Most of the population of the state lives in this region, concentrated in and around the city of Anchorage.    The area includes Cook Inlet, the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, the Kenai Peninsula, Prince William Sound, and the Copper River Valley.   Tourism, fisheries, and petroleum production are important economic activities. CitiesThe major city is Anchorage.   Other towns include Palmer, Wasilla, Kenai, Soldotna, Homer, Seward, Valdez, and Cordova.  ClimateThe climate of Southcentral Alaska is subarctic. 

Spinor<====>29276<====>SpinorIn geometry and physics, spinors are elements of a (complex) vector space that can be associated with Euclidean space.  Spinors can always be defined over the complex numbers.   However, in some signatures there exist real spinors.    Details can be found in spin representation.   Like geometric vectors and more general tensors, spinors transform linearly when the Euclidean space is subjected to a  slight (infinitesimal) rotation.  A formal definition of spinors at this level is that the space of spinors is a linear representation of the Lie algebra of infinitesimal rotations of a certain kind. 

Safety engineering<====>29278<====>Safety engineering Safety engineering is an engineering discipline which assures that engineered systems provide acceptable levels of safety.  It is strongly related to industrial engineering/systems engineering,  and the subset system safety engineering.  Safety engineering assures that a life-critical system behaves as needed, even when components fail. Analysis techniquesAnalysis techniques can be split into two categories: qualitative and quantitative methods.  Both approaches share the goal of finding causal dependencies between a hazard on system level and failures of individual components.  Qualitative approaches focus on the question "What must go wrong, such that a system hazard may occur?", while quantitative methods aim at providing estimations about probabilities, rates and/or severity of consequences. 

SIGGRAPH<====>29279<====>SIGGRAPH  SIGGRAPH (short for Special Interest Group on Computer GRAPHics and Interactive Techniques) is the annual conference on computer graphics (CG) convened by the ACM SIGGRAPH organization.   The first SIGGRAPH conference was in 1974.  The conference is attended by tens of thousands of computer professionals.  Past SIGGRAPH conferences have been held in Los Angeles, Dallas, New Orleans, Boston, Vancouver, and elsewhere in North America. OverviewSome highlights of the conference are its Animation Theater and Electronic Theater presentations, where recently created CG films are played.  There is a large exhibition floor, where several hundred companies set up elaborate booths and compete for attention and recruits. 

Semtex<====>29285<====>Semtex Semtex is a general-purpose plastic explosive containing RDX and PETN.   It is used in commercial blasting, demolition, and in certain military applications.  Semtex was developed and manufactured in Czechoslovakia, originally under the name B 1 and then under "Semtex" designation since 1964, labeled as SEMTEX 1A, since 1967 as SEMTEX H and since 1987 as SEMTEX 10. Originally developed for Czechoslovak military use and export, Semtex eventually became popular with terrorists because it was, until recently, extremely difficult to detect,  as in the case of Pan Am Flight 103. CompositionThe composition of the two most common variants differ according to their use.

Server-side scripting<====>29288<====>Server-side scripting  Server-side scripting is a technique used in web development which involves employing scripts on a web server which produce a response customized for each user's (client's) request to the website.  The alternative is for the web server itself to deliver a static web page.  Scripts can be written in any of a number of server-side scripting languages that are available (see below).  Server-side scripting is distinguished from client-side scripting where embedded scripts, such as JavaScript, are run client-side in a web browser, but both techniques are often used together. Server-side scripting is often used to provide a customized interface for the user. 

Optical spectrometer<====>29293<====>Optical spectrometer An optical spectrometer (spectrophotometer, spectrograph or spectroscope) is an instrument used to measure properties of light over a specific portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, typically used in spectroscopic analysis to identify materials.   The variable measured is most often the light's intensity but could also, for instance, be the polarization state.  The independent variable is usually the wavelength of the light or a unit directly proportional to the photon energy, such as reciprocal centimeters or electron volts, which has a reciprocal relationship to wavelength. A spectrometer is used in spectroscopy for producing spectral lines and measuring their wavelengths and intensities. 

IBM System/360<====>29294<====>IBM System/360  The IBM System/360 (S/360) is a family of mainframe computer systems that was announced by IBM on April 7, 1964, and delivered between 1965 and 1978.   It was the first family of computers designed to cover the complete range of applications, from small to large, both commercial and scientific.  The design made a clear distinction between architecture and implementation, allowing IBM to release a suite of compatible designs at different prices.  All but the incompatible model 44 and the most expensive systems used microcode to implement the instruction set, which featured 8-bit byte addressing and binary, decimal and (hexadecimal) floating-point calculations. 

Spouse<====>29298<====>SpouseA spouse is a life partner in a holy matrimony, marriage, civil union,  domestic partnership  or common-law marriage.  The term is gender neutral, whereas a male spouse is a husband and a female spouse is a wife.  Although a spouse is a form of significant other, the latter term also includes non-marital partners who play a social role similar to that of a spouse, but do not have rights and duties reserved by law to a spouse. Legal status The legal status of a spouse, and the specific rights and obligations associated with that status, vary significantly between different jurisdictions of the world. 

Semiotics<====>29301<====>Semiotics  Semiotics (also called semiotic studies) is the study of meaning-making, the study of sign process (semiosis) and meaningful communication.  It is not to be confused with the Saussurean tradition called semiology which is a subset of semiotics.    This includes the study of signs and sign processes, indication, designation, likeness, analogy, allegory, metonymy, metaphor, symbolism, signification, and communication. The semiotic tradition explores the study of signs and symbols as a significant part of communications.  As different from linguistics, however, semiotics also studies non-linguistic sign systems. Semiotics is frequently seen as having important anthropological dimensions; for example, the Italian semiotician and novelist Umberto Eco proposed that every cultural phenomenon may be studied as communication. 

Sojourner Truth<====>29305<====>Sojourner Truth   Sojourner Truth ( ; born Isabella  (Belle) Baumfree;   – November 26, 1883) was an African-American abolitionist and women's rights activist.  Truth was born into slavery in Swartekill, Ulster County, New York, but escaped with her infant daughter to freedom in 1826.  After going to court to recover her son, in 1828 she became the first black woman to win such a case against a white man. She gave herself the name Sojourner Truth in 1843 after she became convinced that God had called her to leave the city and go into the countryside "testifying the hope that was in her". 

STOVL<====>29306<====>STOVL  A short take-off and vertical landing aircraft (STOVL aircraft) is a fixed-wing aircraft that is able to take off from a short runway (or take off vertically if it does not have a heavy payload) and land vertically (i. e.  with no runway).  The formal NATO definition (since 1991) is: On aircraft carriers, non-catapult-assisted, fixed-wing short takeoffs are accomplished with the use of thrust vectoring, which may also be used in conjunction with a runway "ski-jump".  Use of STOVL tends to allow aircraft to carry a larger payload as compared to during VTOL use, while still only requiring a short runway. 

Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov<====>29307<====>Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov }   Admiral Flota Sovetskogo Soyuza Kuznetsov (  "Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Kuznetsov") is an aircraft carrier (heavy aircraft-carrying missile cruiser, or TAVKR, in Russian classification) serving as the flagship of the Russian Navy.  She was built by the Black Sea Shipyard, the sole manufacturer of Soviet aircraft carriers, in Nikolayev within the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.  The initial name of the ship was Riga; she was launched as Leonid Brezhnev, embarked on sea trials as Tbilisi, and finally named Admiral Flota Sovetskogo Soyuza Kuznetsov after Admiral of the fleet of the Soviet Union Nikolay Gerasimovich Kuznetsov. 

Subaru Forester<====>29311<====>Subaru Forester  The Subaru Forester is a compact crossover SUV manufactured since 1997 by Subaru.  Available in Japan from 1997, the Forester shares its platform with the Impreza.  It has been awarded Motor Trend's 2009 and 2014 SUV of the Year and The Car Connection's Best Car To Buy 2014.  First generation (SF, 1997–2002)  The Forester was introduced at the Tokyo Motor Show in November 1995 as the Streega concept, and made available for sale February 1997 in Japan, and to the US market in 1997 for MY1998.  The Forester was one of the first emerging crossover SUVs. 

Second-system effect<====>29313<====>Second-system effectThe second-system effect (also known as second-system syndrome) is the tendency of small, elegant, and successful systems, to be succeeded by over-engineered, bloated systems, due to inflated expectations and overconfidence. The phrase was first used by Fred Brooks in his book The Mythical Man-Month, first published in 1975. It described the jump from a set of simple operating systems on the IBM 700/7000 series to OS/360 on the 360 series, which happened in 1964.

Sandinista National Liberation Front<====>29316<====>Sandinista National Liberation Front  The Sandinista National Liberation Front ( , FSLN) is a democratic socialistpolitical party in Nicaragua. Its members are called Sandinistas   in both English and Spanish.  The party is named after Augusto César Sandino, who led the Nicaraguan resistance against the United States occupation of Nicaragua in the 1930s.  History Matters "To Abolish the Monroe Doctrine": Proclamation from Augusto César Sandino Retrieved 29/09/12 The FSLN overthrew Anastasio Somoza DeBayle in 1979, ending the Somoza dynasty, and established a revolutionary government in its place.    Following their seizure of power, the Sandinistas ruled Nicaragua from 1979 to 1990, first as part of a Junta of National Reconstruction. 

Streptococcus<====>29318<====>Streptococcus   Streptococcus is a genus of coccus (spherical) Gram-positive bacteria belonging to the phylum Firmicutes  and the order Lactobacillales (lactic acid bacteria).  Cell division in this genus occurs along a single axis in these bacteria, thus they grow in chains or pairs, hence the name—from Greek στρεπτός streptos, meaning easily bent or twisted, like a chain (twisted chain).  (Contrast this with staphylococci, which divide along multiple axes and generate grape-like clusters of cells. )Most are oxidase-negative and catalase-negative, and many are facultative anaerobes. In 1984, many bacteria formerly considered Streptococcus were separated out into the genera Enterococcus and Lactococcus. 

SignWriting<====>29322<====>SignWriting   Sutton SignWriting, or simply, SignWriting, is a system of writing sign languages.  It is highly featural and visually iconic, both in the shapes of the characters, which are abstract pictures of the hands, face, and body, and in their spatial arrangement on the page, which does not follow a sequential order like the letters that make up written English words.  It was developed in 1974 by Valerie Sutton, a dancer who had two years earlier developed DanceWriting. HistoryAs Sutton was teaching DanceWriting to the Royal Danish Ballet, Lars von der Lieth, who was doing research on sign language at the University of Copenhagen, thought it would be useful to use a similar notation for the recording of sign languages. 

Suez Canal<====>29323<====>Suez Canal   The Suez Canal (   ) is an artificial sea-level waterway in Egypt, connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea through the Isthmus of Suez.  Constructed by the Suez Canal Company between 1859 and 1869, it was officially opened on November 17, 1869.  The canal offers watercraft a shorter journey between the North Atlantic and northern Indian Oceans via the Mediterranean and Red seas by avoiding the South Atlantic and southern Indian oceans, in turn reducing the journey by approximately  .  It extends from the northern terminus of Port Said to the southern terminus of Port Tewfik at the city of Suez. 

Signal processing<====>29324<====>Signal processing  {{multiple image }}Signal processing concerns the analysis, synthesis, and modification of signals, which are broadly defined as functions conveying, "information about the behavior or attributes of some phenomenon",  such as sound, images, and biological measurements.   For example, signal processing techniques are used to improve signal transmission fidelity, storage efficiency, and subjective quality, and to emphasize or detect components of interest in a measured signal.  HistoryAccording to Alan V.  Oppenheim and Ronald W.  Schafer, the principles of signal processing can be found in the classical numerical analysis techniques of the 17th century. 

Six-Day War<====>29328<====>Six-Day War    The Six-Day War (Hebrew:  , Milhemet Sheshet Ha Yamim; Arabic:  , an-Naksah, "The Setback" or  , Ḥarb 1967, "War of 1967"), also known as the June War, 1967 Arab–Israeli War, or Third Arab–Israeli War, was fought between June 5 and 10, 1967 by Israel and the neighboring states of Egypt (known at the time as the United Arab Republic), Jordan, and Syria. Relations between Israel and its neighbours had never fully normalised following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.  In 1956 Israel invaded the Egyptian Sinai, with one of its objectives being the reopening of the Straits of Tiran which Egypt had blocked to Israeli shipping since 1950. 

Spectrum<====>29329<====>Spectrum  A spectrum (plural spectra or spectrums ) is a condition that is not limited to a specific set of values but can vary, without steps, across a continuum.  The word was first used scientifically in optics to describe the rainbow of colors in visible light after passing through a prism.  As scientific understanding of light advanced, it came to apply to the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Spectrum has since been applied by analogy to topics outside optics.  Thus, one might talk about the "spectrum of political opinion", or the "spectrum of activity" of a drug, or the "autism spectrum". 

Social dynamics<====>29330<====>Social dynamics   Social dynamics can refer to the behavior of groups that results from the interactions of individual group members as well to the study of the relationship between individual interactions and group level behaviors. The field of social dynamics brings together ideas from Economics, Sociology, Social Psychology, and other disciplines, and is a sub-field of complex adaptive systems or complexity science.  The fundamental assumption of the field is that individuals are influenced by one another's behavior.   The field is closely related to system dynamics.   Like system dynamics, social dynamics is concerned with changes over time and emphasizes the role of feedbacks. 

Social evolution<====>29333<====>Social evolution Social evolution is a subdiscipline of evolutionary biology that is concerned with social behaviors that have fitness consequences for individuals other than the actor.  Social behaviors can be categorized according to the fitness consequences they entail for the actor and recipient. Mutually beneficial – a behavior that increases the direct fitness of both the actor and the recipientSelfish – a behavior that increases the direct fitness of the actor, but the recipient suffers a lossAltruistic – a behavior that increases the direct fitness of the recipient, but the actor may suffer a lossSpiteful – a behavior that decreases the direct fitness of both the actor and the recipientThis classification was proposed by W. 

Systemic functional grammar<====>29336<====>Systemic functional grammar  Systemic functional grammar (SFG) is a form of grammatical description originated by Michael Halliday.   It is part of a social semiotic approach to language called systemic functional linguistics.  In these two terms, systemic refers to the view of language as "a network of systems, or interrelated sets of options for making meaning";  functional refers to Halliday's view that language is as it is because of what it has evolved to do (see Metafunction).  Thus, what he refers to as the multidimensional architecture of language "reflects the multidimensional nature of human experience and interpersonal relations. 

Starfleet<====>29340<====>Starfleet Starfleet is a fictional organization in the Star Trek media franchise.  Within this fictional universe, Starfleet is a service maintained by the United Federation of Planets ("the Federation") as the principal means for conducting deep-space exploration, research, defense, peacekeeping, and diplomacy.  While the majority of Starfleet's members are human and it is headquartered on Earth, hundreds of other species are also represented.  The majority of the franchise's protagonists are Starfleet officers. HistoryDuring production of early episodes of the original series, several details of the makeup of the Star Trek universe had yet to be worked out, including the operating authority for the USS Enterprise. 

Superheterodyne receiver<====>29341<====>Superheterodyne receiverA superheterodyne receiver, often shortened to superhet, is a type of radio receiver that uses frequency mixing to convert a received signal to a fixed intermediate frequency (IF) which can be more conveniently processed than the original carrier frequency.  It was invented by US engineer Edwin Armstrong in 1918 during World War I.Virtually all modern radio receivers use the superheterodyne principle. HistoryBackground"Superheterodyne" is a contraction of "supersonic heterodyne", where "supersonic" indicates frequencies above the range of human hearing.  The word heterodyne is derived from the Greek roots hetero- "different", and -dyne "power". 

Seventh Day Baptists<====>29344<====>Seventh Day Baptists Seventh Day Baptists (SDBs) are a Baptist denomination which observes the Sabbath on the seventh-day of the week—Saturday—in accordance with the Biblical Sabbath of the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:8, Deuteronomy 5:12).  The movement originated in mid-17th century England and spread within a few years to the British colonies in North America.  Today, the Seventh Day Baptist World Federation represents over 50,000 members in 22 countries worldwide, of whom over 20,000 reside in India and almost 5,000 reside in the United States.  HistoryIn EnglandSeventh Day Baptists trace the beginning of their movement to coalescing factors during the decade of the 1650s in England. 

Shem<====>29345<====>Shem  Shem ( ;   Šēm;   Sēm; Ge'ez: ሴም, Sēm; "renown; prosperity; name"; Arabic:   Sām) was one of the sons of Noah in the Hebrew Bible as well as in Islamic literature.  Genesis 10:21 refers to relative ages of Shem and his brother Japheth, but with sufficient ambiguity to have yielded different English translations.  The verse is translated in the KJV as "Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born. ".  However, the New American Standard Bible gives, "Also to Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, and the older brother of Japheth, children were born. 

Sambuca<====>29346<====>Sambuca  Sambuca ( ) is an Italian anise-flavoured, usually colourless, liqueur.  Its most common variety is often referred to as white sambuca to differentiate it from other varieties that are deep blue in colour (black sambuca) or bright red (red sambuca).  Traditional guide to Sambuca  Like other anise-flavoured liqueurs, the ouzo effect is sometimes observed when combined with water. IngredientsSambuca is flavoured with essential oils obtained from star anise, or less commonly, green anise.  Other spices such as elderflower, liquorice and others may be included, but are not required as per the legal definition.  It is bottled at a minimum of 38% alcohol by volume. 

Sweeney Todd<====>29349<====>Sweeney Todd  Sweeney Todd is a fictional character who first appeared as the villain of the Victorian penny dreadful The String of Pearls (1846–47). The tale became a staple of Victorian melodrama and London urban legend, and has been retold many times since, most notably in the Tony award–winning Broadway musical by Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler. Claims that Sweeney Todd was a historical person   are strongly disputed by scholars, (Full text )although possible legendary prototypes exist.  Plot synopsisIn the original version of the tale, Todd is a barber who dispatches his victims by pulling a lever as they sit in his barber chair. 

Selection sort<====>29352<====>Selection sort In computer science, selection sort is a sorting algorithm, specifically an in-place comparison sort.  It has O(n 2 ) time complexity, making it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort.  Selection sort is noted for its simplicity, and it has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly where auxiliary memory is limited. The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already sorted, which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list, and the sublist of items remaining to be sorted that occupy the rest of the list. 

Syracuse University<====>29353<====>Syracuse University  Syracuse University (commonly referred to as Syracuse, 'Cuse, or SU ) is a private research university in Syracuse, New York, United States.  The institution's roots can be traced to the Genesee Wesleyan Seminary (later becoming Genesee College), founded in 1831 by the Methodist Episcopal Church in Lima, New York.  After several years of debate over relocating the college to Syracuse, the university was established in 1870, independent of the college.  Since 1920, the university has identified itself as nonsectarian,although it maintains a relationship with The United Methodist Church. The campus is in the University Hill neighborhood of Syracuse, east and southeast of downtown, on one of the larger hills. 

Snake oil<====>29354<====>Snake oil  Snake oil is a fraudulent liniment without snake extract.  Currently, it has come to refer to any product with questionable or unverifiable quality or benefit.  By extension, a snake oil salesman is someone who knowingly sells fraudulent goods or who is a fraud, quack, or charlatan. The use of snake oil long predates the 19th century.  In Europe, viper oil had been commonly recommended for many afflictions, including the ones for which rattlesnake oil was subsequently favored (e. g. , rheumatism and skin diseases).   In China, oil made from Chinese water snake (Enhydris chinensis) fat is a traditional liniment used for treating joint pain. 

Stanley Elkin<====>29355<====>Stanley Elkin   Stanley Lawrence Elkin (May 11, 1930 – May 31, 1995)  was an American novelist, short story writer, and essayist.  His extravagant, satirical fiction revolves around American consumerism, popular culture, and male-female relationships. BiographyElkin was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York, and grew up in Chicago from age three onwards.He did both his undergraduate and graduate work at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, receiving a bachelor's degree in English in 1952 and a Ph. D.  in 1961 for his dissertation on William Faulkner.  (During this period he was drafted and served in the U. 

International Society of Cryptozoology<====>29356<====>International Society of CryptozoologyThe International Society of Cryptozoology (ISC) was an organization dedicated to the pseudoscience of cryptozoology founded in 1982 in Washington, D. C.  It ceased to exist in 1998. It was founded to serve as a center for documenting and evaluating topics of interest to cryptozoologists.  G.  G.

Send In the Clowns<====>29357<====>Send In the Clowns  "Send In the Clowns" is a song written by Stephen Sondheim for the 1973 musical A Little Night Music, an adaptation of Ingmar Bergman's film Smiles of a Summer Night.  It is a ballad from Act Two, in which the character Desirée reflects on the ironies and disappointments of her life.  Among other things, she looks back on an affair years earlier with the lawyer Fredrik.  Meeting him after so long, she finds that he is now in an unconsummated marriage with a much younger woman.  Desirée proposes marriage to rescue him from this situation, but he declines, citing his dedication to his bride. 

Sinhalese people<====>29359<====>Sinhalese people  The Sinhalese (Sinhala: සිංහල ජාතිය Sinhala Jathiya, also known as Hela) are an Indo-Aryan speaking ethnic group native to the island of Sri Lanka.   They constitute about 75% of the Sri Lankan population and number greater than 15 million.   The Sinhalese identity is based on language, historical heritage and religion.  The Sinhalese people speak the Sinhalese language, an Indo-Aryan language, and are predominantly Theravada Buddhists, Lewis, M.  Paul (ed. ), 2009.

Spiel des Jahres<====>29364<====>Spiel des Jahres The Spiel des Jahres ( , Game of the Year) is an award for board and card games, created in 1978 with the stated purpose of rewarding excellence in game design, and promoting top-quality games in the German market.It is thought that the existence and popularity of the award is one of the major drivers of the quality of games coming out of Germany.   A Spiel des Jahres nomination can increase the typical sales of a game from 500–3000 copies to around 10,000; and the winner can usually expect to sell 300,000 to 500,000 copies. 

Synthetic element<====>29365<====>Synthetic element In chemistry, a synthetic element is a chemical element that does not occur naturally on Earth, and can only be created artificially.  So far, 24 synthetic elements have been created (those with atomic numbers 95–118).  All are unstable, decaying with half-lives ranging from 15. 6 million years to a few hundred microseconds. Seven other elements were first created artificially and thus considered synthetic, but later discovered to exist naturally (in trace quantities) as well; among them plutonium—first synthesized in 1940—the one best known to laypeople, because of its use in atomic bombs and nuclear reactors. PropertiesSynthetic elements are radioactive and decay rapidly into lighter elements—possessing half-lives so short, relative to the age of Earth (which formed approximately 4. 

Shoghi Effendi<====>29366<====>Shoghi Effendi Shoghí Effendí Rabbání (March 1, 1897 – November 4, 1957), better known as Shoghi Effendi, was the Guardian and appointed head of the Bahá'í Faith from 1921 until his death in 1957.  After the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá in 1921, the leadership of the Bahá'í community changed from that of a single individual to an administrative order with executive and legislative branches, the head of each being the Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice, respectively.  Shoghi Effendi was referred to as the Guardian, and had the authority to interpret the writings of the three central figures of the religion and define the sphere of legislative authority. 

Slope<====>29368<====>Slope  In mathematics, the slope or gradient of a line is a number that describes both the direction and the steepness of the line.   Slope is often denoted by the letter m; there is no clear answer to the question why the letter m is used for slope, but it might be from the "m for multiple" in the equation of a straight line "y = mx + b" or "y = mx + c".  Slope is calculated by finding the ratio of the "vertical change" to the "horizontal change" between (any) two distinct points on a line. 

Sex organ<====>29369<====>Sex organ A sex organ (also called a reproductive organ, primary sex organ or primary sexual characteristic) is any anatomical part of the body in a complex organism that is involved in sexual reproduction and together constitute the reproductive system.  The external and visible organs, in males and females, are the primary sex organs known as the genitals or genitalia.  The internal organs are known as the secondary sex organs   and are sometimes referred to as the internal genitalia. The characteristics that begin to appear during puberty, such as, in humans, pubic hair on both sexes and facial hair on the male, are known as secondary sex characteristics. 

Snake<====>29370<====>Snake    Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes.   Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales.  Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws.  To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung.  Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. 

Steam turbine<====>29374<====>Steam turbine A steam turbine is a device that extracts thermal energy from pressurized steam and uses it to do mechanical work on a rotating output shaft.  Its modern manifestation was invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884.   Because the turbine generates rotary motion, it is particularly suited to be used to drive an electrical generator – about 90% of all electricity generation in the United States in the year 1996 was by use of steam turbines. The steam turbine is a form of heat engine that derives much of its improvement in thermodynamic efficiency from the use of multiple stages in the expansion of the steam, which results in a closer approach to the ideal reversible expansion process. 

Sardinia<====>29376<====>Sardinia   Sardinia (   ;    ,    / , Sassarese: Sardhigna, Gallurese: Saldigna, Catalan: Sardenya, Tabarchino: Sardegna) is the second largest island in the Mediterranean Sea (after Sicily and before Cyprus) and an autonomous region of Italy.  It is located in the Western Mediterranean, to the immediate south of the French island of Corsica. The region's official name is Regione Autonoma della Sardegna / Regione Autònoma de Sardigna (Autonomous Region of Sardinia),  and its capital and largest city is Cagliari.  It is divided into four provinces and a metropolitan city. 

Scrooge McDuck<====>29378<====>Scrooge McDuck    Scrooge McDuck is a fictional character created in 1947 by Carl Barks during his time as a work-for-hire for The Walt Disney Company.  Scrooge is an elderly Scottish anthropomorphic Pekin duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet.  He typically wears a red or blue frock coat, top hat, pince-nez glasses, and spats.  He is portrayed in animations as speaking with a Scottish accent. Named after Ebenezer Scrooge from the 1843 novel A Christmas Carol, Scrooge is an incredibly wealthy business magnate and self-proclaimed "adventure-capitalist" whose dominant character trait is his thrift. 

Shiva (Judaism)<====>29379<====>Shiva (Judaism)Shiva  ( , literally "seven") is the week-long mourning period in Judaism for first-degree relatives: father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, and spouse.  The ritual is referred to as "sitting shiva".  Immediately after burial, people  assume the halakhic status of "avel" ( ).  This state lasts for seven days, during which family members traditionally gather in one home (preferably the home of the deceased) and receive visitors.  At the funeral, mourners traditionally wear an outer garment or ribbon that was torn at the funeral in a ritual known as keriah.  This garment is worn throughout shiva. 

Semi-trailer truck<====>29381<====>Semi-trailer truck   A semi-trailer truck (more commonly semi truck or simply "semi") is the combination of a tractor unit and one or more semi-trailers to carry freight.  A semi-trailer attaches to the tractor with a fifth wheel hitch, with much of its weight borne by the tractor.  The result is that both the tractor and semi-trailer will have a distinctly different design than a rigid truck and trailer. It is variously known as a transport in Canada; semi or single in Australia and New Zealand; semi, tractor-trailer, big rig, or eighteen-wheeler in the United States; and articulated lorry, abbreviated artic, in the United Kingdom and Ireland. 

Stonewall riots<====>29383<====>Stonewall riotsThe Stonewall riots (also referred to as the Stonewall uprising or the Stonewall rebellion) were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by members of the gay (LGBT) community At the time, the term "gay" was commonly used to refer to all LGBT people.   against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City.  They are widely considered to constitute the most important event leading to the gay liberation movement    and the modern fight for LGBT rights in the United States. 

Sheffer stroke<====>29388<====>Sheffer strokeIn Boolean functions and propositional calculus, the Sheffer stroke, named after Henry M.  Sheffer, written "|" (see vertical bar, not to be confused with "||" which is often used to represent disjunction), "Dpq", or "↑" (an upwards arrow), denotes a logical operation that is equivalent to the negation of the conjunction operation, expressed in ordinary language as "not both".   It is also called nand  ("not and") or the alternative denial, since it says in effect that at least one of its operands is false.   In Boolean algebra and digital electronics it is known as the NAND operation. 

Stalactite<====>29390<====>StalactiteA stalactite ( ,  ; from the Greek stalasso, (σταλάσσω), "to drip", and meaning "that which drips") is a type of formation that hangs from the ceiling of caves, hot springs, or manmade structures such as bridges and mines.  Any material which is soluble, can be deposited as a colloid, or is in suspension, or is capable of being melted, may form a stalactite.  Stalactites may be composed of lava, minerals, mud, peat, pitch, sand, sinter, and amberat (crystallized urine of pack rats). A stalactite is not necessarily a speleothem, though speleothems are the most common form of stalactite because of the abundance of limestone caves. 

Strangers in Paradise<====>29391<====>Strangers in Paradise   Strangers in Paradise is a long-running, mostly self-published black-and-white comic book that was written and drawn by Terry Moore.  Essentially the story of a love triangle between two women and one man, Strangers in Paradise is a slice-of-life dramady that veered into the crime genre. The first issue was published January 1, 1993.  The series reached its planned conclusion in 2007 with issue #90 of volume 3.    A follow up novel was announced at Comic-Con International 2012.  Origins and publication historyTerry Moore stated that "I started out wanting to do a newspaper strip, and tried one idea after another before I realised I hated the gag-a-day life and really wanted to try a story instead. 

Summer<====>29392<====>Summer Summer  is the hottest of the four temperate seasons, falling after spring and before autumn.  At the summer solstice, the days are longest and the nights are shortest, with day-length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice.  The date of the beginning of summer varies according to climate, tradition and culture.  When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice-versa. Summer timingFrom an astronomical view, the equinoxes and solstices would be the middle of the respective seasons,   but sometimes astronomical summer is defined as starting at the solstice, the time of maximal insolation, or on the traditional date of June 21.

Shrike<====>29394<====>Shrike  Shrikes ( ) are carnivorous passerine birds of the family Laniidae.  The family is composed of thirty-one species in four genera.  They are fairly closely related to the bush-shrike family Malaconotidae. The family name, and that of the largest genus, Lanius, is derived from the Latin word for "butcher", and some shrikes are also known as butcherbirds because of their feeding habits.The common English name shrike is from Old English scrīc, alluding to the shrike's shriek-like call.    Distribution, migration and habitatMost shrike species have a Eurasian and African distribution, with just two breeding in North America (the loggerhead and great grey shrikes). 

Screwdriver (cocktail)<====>29396<====>Screwdriver (cocktail) A screwdriver is a popular alcoholic highball drink made with orange juice and vodka.  While the basic drink is simply the two ingredients, there are many variations; the most common one is made with one part vodka, one part of any kind of orange soda, and one part of orange juice.  Many of the variations have different names in different parts of the world.  The International Bartenders Association has designated this cocktail as an IBA Official Cocktail. HistoryThis drink appears in literature as early as 1938 "And answered it 'The famous Smirnoff Screwdriver', Just pour a jigger of smirnoff vodka over ice cubes, fill glass with orange juice and serve". 

Single-stage-to-orbit<====>29398<====>Single-stage-to-orbit  A single-stage-to-orbit (or SSTO) vehicle reaches orbit from the surface of a body without jettisoning hardware, expending only propellants and fluids.  The term usually, but not exclusively, refers to reusable vehicles.No Earth-launched SSTO launch vehicles have ever been constructed.  To date, orbital launches have been performed either by multi-stage fully or partially expendable rockets, the Space Shuttle having both attributes. Launch costs for low Earth orbit (LEO) range from $10,000 to $19,000 per kg of payload ($4,500–$8,500 / pound).   Reusable SSTO vehicles offer the promise of reduced launch expenses by eliminating recurring costs associated with hardware replacement inherent in expendable launch systems. 

Structural biology<====>29400<====>Structural biology Structural biology is a branch of molecular biology, biochemistry, and biophysics concerned with the molecular structure of biological macromolecules, especially amino and nucleic acids, how they acquire the structures they have, and how alterations in their structures affect their function.   This subject is of great interest to biologists because macromolecules carry out most of the functions of cells, and only by coiling into specific three-dimensional shapes that they are able to perform these functions.  This architecture, the "tertiary structure" of molecules, depends in a complicated way on the molecules' basic composition, or "primary structures. " Biomolecules are too small to see in detail even with the most advanced light microscopes. 

Sunni Islam<====>29402<====>Sunni Islam   Sunni Islam ( ) is the largest denomination of Islam.  Its name comes from the word Sunnah, referring to the exemplary behaviour of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.   The differences between Sunni and Shia Muslims arose from a disagreement over the choice of Muhammad's successor and subsequently acquired broader political significance, as well as theological and juridical dimensions.    According to Sunni traditions, Muhammad did not clearly designate a successor and the Muslim community acted according to his sunnah in electing his father-in-law Abu Bakr as the first caliph.    This contrasts with the Shi'a view, which holds that Muhammad appointed his son-in-law and cousin Ali ibn Abi Talib to succeed him. 

Sour mix<====>29403<====>Sour mix Sour mix (also known as sweet and sour mix) is a mixer that is yellow-green in color and is used in many cocktails.  It is made from approximately equal parts lemon and/or lime juice and simple syrup and shaken vigorously with ice.  This produces a pearly-white liquid with a pronounced flavor. Optionally, egg-whites may be added to make the liquid slightly foamy. Sour mix can be mixed with liquor(s) to make a sour drink; most common are vodka sour (vodka) and whiskey sour (whiskey). Pre-mixed versions are available, and are in use in many bars.   These typically consist of a powder which must be rehydrated by adding water prior to use. 

Sikh<====>29405<====>Sikh   A Sikh ( ; ) is a follower of Sikhism, a monotheistic religion which originated during the 15th century in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent.   The term "Sikh" has its origin in the Sanskrit words शिष्य ( ; disciple, student) or शिक्ष ( ; instruction).    A Sikh, according to Article I of the Sikh Rehat Maryada (the Sikh code of conduct), is "any human being who faithfully believes in One Immortal Being; ten Gurus, from Guru Nanak to Guru Gobind Singh; Guru Granth Sahib; the teachings of the ten Gurus and the baptism bequeathed by the tenth Guru". 

Superworld<====>29407<====>Superworld Superworld is a superhero-themed role-playing game published by Chaosium in 1983.   Written by Basic Role-Playing and RuneQuest author Steve Perrin, Superworld began as one third of the Worlds of Wonder product, which also included a generic fantasy setting, "Magic World", and a generic science fiction setting, "Future World", all using the same core Basic Role-Playing rules.   Only Superworld became a game in its own right. Game systemSuperworld is based on the traditional Chaosium Basic Role-Playing system augmented by super-powers.  Seven characteristics (Strength, Constitution, Size, Intelligence, Power, Dexterity, Appearance) are rolled with dice (2D6+6, rather the 3d6 used for many other Basic Role-Playing games. 

Samuel Taylor Coleridge<====>29408<====>Samuel Taylor Coleridge    Samuel Taylor Coleridge  ( ; 21 October 1772 25 July 1834) was an English poet, literary critic, philosopher and theologian who, with his friend William Wordsworth, was a founder of the Romantic Movement in England and a member of the Lake Poets.   He wrote the poems The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Kubla Khan, as well as the major prose work Biographia Literaria.  His critical work, especially on William Shakespeare, was highly influential, and he helped introduce German idealist philosophy to English-speaking culture.  Coleridge coined many familiar words and phrases, including suspension of disbelief. 

Spica<====>29409<====>Spica Spica ( ), also designated Alpha Virginis (α Virginis, abbreviated Alpha Vir, α Vir), is the brightest star in the constellation of Virgo and the 16th brightest star in the night sky.  Analysis of its parallax shows that it is located 250 ± 10 light years from the Sun.   It is a spectroscopic binary and rotating ellipsoidal variable; a system whose two main stars are so close together they are egg-shaped rather than spherical, and can only be separated by their spectra.  The primary is a blue giant and a variable star of the Beta Cephei type. 

Stuart Little<====>29414<====>Stuart Little  Stuart Little is a 1945 children's novel by E.  B.  White,  his first book for children, and is widely recognized as a classic in children's literature.  Stuart Little was illustrated by the subsequently award-winning artist Garth Williams, also his first work for children.  It is a realistic fantasy about Stuart Little who, though born to human parents in New York City, ″looked very much like a rat/mouse in every way″ (chapter I). BackgroundIn a letter White wrote in response to inquiries from readers, he described how he came to conceive of Stuart Little: "many years ago I went to bed one night in a railway sleeping car, and during the night I dreamed about a tiny boy who acted rather like a rat. 

Statite<====>29417<====>StatiteA statite (a portmanteau of static and satellite) is a hypothetical type of artificial satellite that employs a solar sail to continuously modify its orbit in ways that gravity alone would not allow.  Typically, a statite would use the solar sail to "hover" in a location that would not otherwise be available as a stable geosynchronous orbit.  Statites have been proposed that would remain in fixed locations high over Earth's poles, using reflected sunlight to counteract the gravity pulling them down.  Statites might also employ their sails to change the shape or velocity of more conventional orbits, depending upon the purpose of the particular statite. 

Solar sail<====>29420<====>Solar sail  Solar sails (also called light sails or photon sails) are a form of spacecraft propulsion using radiation pressure exerted by sunlight on large mirrors.  A useful analogy may be a sailing boat; the light exerting a force on the mirrors is akin to a sail being blown by the wind.  High-energy laser beams could be used as an alternative light source to exert much greater force than would be possible using sunlight, a concept known as beam sailing. Solar sail craft offer the possibility of low-cost operations combined with long operating lifetimes.  Since they have few moving parts and use no propellant, they can potentially be used numerous times for delivery of payloads. 

Sabellianism<====>29425<====>Sabellianism In Christianity, Sabellianism in the Eastern church or Patripassianism in the Western church (also known as modalism, modalistic monarchianism, or modal monarchism) is the nontrinitarian or anti-Trinitarian belief that the Heavenly Father, Resurrected Son, and Holy Spirit are three different modes or aspects of one monadic God, as perceived by the believer, rather than three distinct persons within the Godhead—that there are no real or substantial differences among the three, such that there is no substantial identity for the Spirit or the Son.   Modalistic monarchianism has been generally understood to have arisen during the second and third centuries, and to have been regarded as heresy after the fourth, although this is disputed by some. 

Sino-Indian War<====>29426<====>Sino-Indian WarThe Sino-Indian War ( ), also known as the Sino-Indian Border Conflict ( ), was a war between China and India that occurred in 1962.  A disputed Himalayan border was the main pretext for war, but other issues played a role.  There had been a series of violent border incidents after the 1959 Tibetan uprising, when India had granted asylum to the Dalai Lama.  India initiated a Forward Policy in which it placed outposts along the border, including several north of the McMahon Line, the eastern portion of a Line of Actual Control proclaimed by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai in 1959. 

Simple module<====>29430<====>Simple moduleIn mathematics, specifically in ring theory, the simple modules over a ring R are the (left or right) modules over R that have no non-zero proper submodules.   Equivalently, a module M is simple if and only if every cyclic submodule generated by a non-zero element of M equals M.   Simple modules form building blocks for the modules of finite length, and they are analogous to the simple groups in group theory. In this article, all modules will be assumed to be right unital modules over a ring R. ExamplesZ-modules are the same as abelian groups, so a simple Z-module is an abelian group which has no non-zero proper subgroups. 

Sonar<====>29438<====>Sonar  Sonar (originally an acronym for SOund Navigation And Ranging) is a technique that uses sound propagation (usually underwater, as in submarine navigation) to navigate, communicate with or detect objects on or under the surface of the water, such as other vessels.  Two types of technology share the name "sonar": passive sonar is essentially listening for the sound made by vessels; active sonar is emitting pulses of sounds and listening for echoes.  Sonar may be used as a means of acoustic location and of measurement of the echo characteristics of "targets" in the water.  Acoustic location in air was used before the introduction of radar. 

Slavs<====>29440<====>Slavs   Slavs are an Indo-European ethno-linguistic group, who speak various Slavic languages of the Balto-Slavic language group.  They are native to Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Southeastern Europe, Northeastern Europe, North Asia, Central Asia and West Asia.  From the early 6th century they spread to inhabit most of Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe.   Slavs are the largest ethno-linguistic group in Europe.    Present-day Slavic people are classified into East Slavs (chiefly Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians), West Slavs (chiefly Poles, Czechs and Slovaks), and South Slavs (chiefly Serbs, Bulgarians, Croats, Bosniaks, Slovenes, Macedonians and Montenegrins). 

Skylab<====>29441<====>Skylab Skylab was the United States' first and only space station, orbiting Earth from 1973 to 1979, when it fell back to Earth amid huge worldwide media attention.  Launched and operated by NASA, Skylab included a workshop, a solar observatory, and other systems necessary for crew survival and scientific experiments.  It was launched unmanned by a modified Saturn V rocket, with a weight of  .  Lifting Skylab into low earth orbit was the final mission and launch of a Saturn V rocket (which was famous for carrying the manned Moon landing missions). 

StrongARM<====>29445<====>StrongARMThe StrongARM is a family of computer microprocessors developed by Digital Equipment Corporation and manufactured in the late 1990s which implemented the ARM v4 instruction set architecture.  It was later sold to Intel in 1997, who continued to manufacture it before replacing it with the XScale in the early 2000s. HistoryThe StrongARM was a collaborative project between DEC and Advanced RISC Machines to create a faster ARM microprocessor.  The StrongARM was designed to address the upper-end of the low-power embedded market, where users needed more performance than the ARM could deliver while being able to accept more external support. 

Shaul Mofaz<====>29450<====>Shaul Mofaz  Lieutenant General Shaul Mofaz ( ; born Shahrām Mofazzazkār  ; 4 November 1948) is an Iranian-born Israeli former soldier and politician.  He joined the Israel Defense Forces in 1966 and served in the Paratroopers Brigade.  He fought in the Six-Day War, Yom Kippur War, 1982 Lebanon War, and Operation Entebbe with the paratroopers and Sayeret Matkal, an elite special forces unit.  In 1998 he became the sixteenth IDF's Chief of the General Staff, serving until 2002.  He is of Iranian Jewish ancestry. After leaving the army, he entered politics.  He was appointed Minister of Defense in 2002, holding the position until 2006 when he was elected to the Knesset on the Kadima list. 

Stasi<====>29452<====>Stasi   The Ministry for State Security ( , MfS) or State Security Service (Staatssicherheitsdienst, SSD), commonly known as the Stasi ( ),  was the official state security service of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).  It has been described as one of the most effective and repressive intelligence and secret police agencies to have ever existed.   The Stasi was headquartered in East Berlin, with an extensive complex in Berlin-Lichtenberg and several smaller facilities throughout the city.  The Stasi motto was "Schild und Schwert der Partei" (Shield and Sword of the Party), referring to the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (German: Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands, SED). 

Sandra Bullock<====>29455<====>Sandra Bullock   Sandra Annette Bullock ( ; born July 26, 1964)  is a German-American actress, producer, and philanthropist.  She made her acting debut with a minor role in the 1987 thriller Hangmen, and made her television debut in the film Bionic Showdown: The Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman (1989), and played the lead role in the short-lived NBC sitcom Working Girl.  Her breakthrough role was in the film Demolition Man (1993).  She subsequently starred in several successful films including Speed (1994), While You Were Sleeping (1995), The Net (1995), A Time to Kill (1996), Hope Floats (1998), and Practical Magic (1998). 

Smallfilms<====>29458<====>SmallfilmsSmallfilms is a British television producution company that made animated tv programmes for children from 1959 until the 1980s.   In 2014 the company began operating again, producing a new series of its most famous show, The Clangers.   It was originally a partnership between Oliver Postgate (writer, animator and narrator) and Peter Firmin (modelmaker and illustrator).  Several very popular series of short films were made using stop-motion animation, including Clangers, Noggin the Nog and Ivor the Engine.  Another Smallfilms production, Bagpuss, came top of a BBC poll to find the favourite British children's programme of the 20th Century.

Sabotage<====>29462<====>Sabotage    Sabotage is a deliberate action aimed at weakening a polity or corporation through subversion, obstruction, disruption or destruction.  In a workplace setting, sabotage is the conscious withdrawal of efficiency generally directed at causing some change in workplace conditions.  One who engages in sabotage is a saboteur.  Saboteurs typically try to conceal their identities because of the consequences of their actions. Any unexplained adverse condition might be sabotage.  Sabotage is sometimes called tampering, meddling, tinkering, malicious pranks, malicious hacking, a practical joke or the like to avoid needing to invoke legal and organizational requirements for addressing sabotage. 

Scabbard<====>29463<====>Scabbard  A scabbard is a sheath for holding a sword, knife, or other large blade.  Scabbards have been made of many materials over the millennia, including leather, wood, and metals such as brass or steel. Types of scabbardsMost commonly, scabbards were worn suspended from a sword belt or shoulder belt called a baldric. Ancient scabbardsWooden scabbards were usually covered in fabric or leather, the leather versions also usually bore metal fittings for added protection and carrying ease.  Japanese blades typically have their sharp cutting edge protected by a wooden scabbard called a saya.  Many scabbards, such as ones the Greeks and Romans used, were small and light. 

Spinel<====>29467<====>Spinel Spinel ( ) is the magnesium aluminium member of the larger spinel group of minerals.  It has the formula MgAl 2 O 4  in the cubic crystal system.  Its name comes from Latin "spina" (arrow).  Spinel.  Mindat. org  Balas ruby is an old name for a rose-tinted variety of spinel. PropertiesSpinel crystallizes in the isometric system; common crystal forms are octahedra, usually twinned.  It has an imperfect octahedral cleavage and a conchoidal fracture.  Its hardness is 8, its specific gravity is 3. 5–4. 1, and it is transparent to opaque with a vitreous to dull luster. 

Speech recognition<====>29468<====>Speech recognition  Speech recognition is the inter-disciplinary sub-field of computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enables the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers.  It is also known as "automatic speech recognition" (ASR), "computer speech recognition", or just "speech to text" (STT).  It incorporates knowledge and research in the linguistics, computer science, and electrical engineering fields. Some speech recognition systems require "training" (also called "enrollment") where an individual speaker reads text or isolated vocabulary into the system.  The system analyzes the person's specific voice and uses it to fine-tune the recognition of that person's speech, resulting in increased accuracy. 

Sapphire<====>29469<====>Sapphire   Sapphire is a gemstone, a variety of the mineral corundum, an aluminium oxide ( ).  It is typically blue, but natural "fancy" sapphires also occur in yellow, purple, orange, and green colors; "parti sapphires" show two or more colors.  The only color which sapphire cannot be is red – as red colored corundum is called ruby,    another corundum variety.  Pink colored corundum may be either classified as ruby or sapphire depending on locale.  This variety in color is due to trace amounts of elements such as iron, titanium, chromium, copper, or magnesium. 

Slack voice<====>29471<====>Slack voice Slack voice (or lax voice) is the pronunciation of consonant or vowels with a glottal opening slightly wider than that occurring in modal voice.  Such sounds are often referred to informally as lenis or half-voiced in the case of consonants.  In some Chinese varieties, such as Wu, and in many Austronesian languages, the 'intermediate' phonation of slack stops confuses listeners of languages without these distinctions, so that different transcription systems may use   or   for the same consonant.  In Xhosa, slack-voiced consonants have usually been transcribed as breathy voice.  Although the IPA has no dedicated diacritic for slack voice, the voiceless diacritic (the under-ring) may be used with a voiced consonant letter, though this convention is also used for partially voiced consonants in languages such as English.

It has been typically used as a compact and fast-moving rotorcraft for utility and anti-submarine warfare missions. Development of the Seasprite had been initiated during the late 1950s in response to a request from the United States Navy, calling for a suitably fast and compact naval helicopter for utility missions.  Kaman's submission, internally designated as the K-20, was favourably evaluated, leading to the issuing of a contract for the construction of four prototypes and an initial batch of 12 production helicopters, designated as the HU2K-1. 

Stop consonant<====>29480<====>Stop consonant In phonetics, a stop, also known as a plosive or oral occlusive, is a consonant in which the vocal tract is blocked so that all airflow ceases. The occlusion may be made with the tongue blade ( ,  ) or body ( ,  ), lips ( ,  ), or glottis ( ).  Stops contrast with nasals, where the vocal tract is blocked but airflow continues through the nose, as in   and  , and with fricatives, where partial occlusion impedes but does not block airflow in the vocal tract. TerminologyThe terms stop, occlusive, and plosive are often and inaccurately used interchangeably. 

Stayman convention<====>29482<====>Stayman convention  Stayman is a bidding convention in the card game contract bridge.

Secondary education<====>29498<====>Secondary educationSecondary education covers two phases on the International Standard Classification of Education scale.  Level 2 or lower secondary education (less common junior secondary education) is considered the second and final phase of basic education, and level 3 (upper) secondary education is the stage before tertiary education.   Every country aims to provide basic education, but the systems and terminology remain unique to them.   Secondary education typically takes place after six years of primary education and is followed by higher education, vocational education or employment.   Like primary education, in most countries secondary education is compulsory, at least until the age of 16.

Sustainable development<====>29501<====>Sustainable development  Sustainable development is the organizing principle for meeting human development goals while at the same time sustaining the ability of natural systems to provide the natural resources and ecosystem services upon which the economy and society depend.  The desired result is a state of society where living conditions and resource use continue to meet human needs without undermining the integrity and stability of the natural systems. While the modern concept of sustainable development is derived mostly from the 1987 Brundtland Report, it is also rooted in earlier ideas about sustainable forest management and twentieth century environmental concerns. 

Scientific American<====>29507<====>Scientific American Scientific American (informally abbreviated SciAm) is an American popular science magazine.  Many famous scientists, including Albert Einstein, have contributed articles in the past 170 years.  It is the oldest continuously published monthly magazine in the United States (though it only became monthly in 1921). HistoryScientific American was founded by inventor and publisher Rufus M.  Porter in 1845    as a four-page weekly newspaper.  Throughout its early years, much emphasis was placed on reports of what was going on at the U. S.  Patent Office.  It also reported on a broad range of inventions including perpetual motion machines, an 1860 device for buoying vessels by Abraham Lincoln, and the universal joint which now can be found in nearly every automobile manufactured. 

Siouxsie and the Banshees<====>29511<====>Siouxsie and the Banshees   Siouxsie and the Banshees were an English rock band, formed in London in 1976 by vocalist Siouxsie Sioux and bass guitarist Steven Severin.  They have been widely influential.  Initially associated with the English punk rock scene, the band rapidly evolved to create "a form of post-punk discord full of daring rhythmic and sonic experimentation".In 1978, they released their critically acclaimed debut album, The Scream, and built their reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases.  With Juju in 1981, the group also became an important influence on the emerging gothic rock scene. 

Simula<====>29513<====>Simula  Simula is the name of two simulation programming languages, Simula I and Simula 67, developed in the 1960s at the Norwegian Computing Center in Oslo, by Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard.  Syntactically, it is a fairly faithful superset of ALGOL 60.Simula 67 introduced objects,   classes,   inheritance and subclasses,   virtual procedures,   coroutines,   and discrete event simulation,   and features garbage collection.    Also other forms of subtyping (besides inheriting subclasses) were introduced in Simula derivatives.  Simula is considered the first object-oriented programming language. 

SNOBOL<====>29515<====>SNOBOL  SNOBOL (StriNg Oriented and symBOlic Language) is a series of computer programming languages developed between 1962 and 1967 at AT&T Bell Laboratories by David J.  Farber, Ralph E.  Griswold and Ivan P.  Polonsky, culminating in SNOBOL4.   It was one of a number of text-string-oriented languages developed during the 1950s and 1960s; others included COMIT and TRAC. SNOBOL4 stands apart from most programming languages of its era by having patterns as a first-class data type (i. e.  a data type whose values can be manipulated in all ways permitted to any other data type in the programming language) and by providing operators for pattern concatenation and alternation. 

Statistical physics<====>29518<====>Statistical physics  Statistical physics is a branch of physics that uses methods of probability theory and statistics, and particularly the mathematical tools for dealing with large populations and approximations, in solving physical problems.  It can describe a wide variety of fields with an inherently stochastic nature.  Its applications include many problems in the fields of physics, biology, chemistry, neurology, and even some social sciences, such as sociology.  Its main purpose is to clarify the properties of matter in aggregate, in terms of physical laws governing atomic motion.  In particular, statistical mechanics develops the phenomenological results of thermodynamics from a probabilistic examination of the underlying microscopic systems. 

Side effect (computer science)<====>29519<====>Side effect (computer science) In computer science, a function or expression is said to have a side effect if it modifies some state outside its scope or has an observable interaction with its calling functions or the outside world besides returning a value.  For example, a particular function might modify a global variable or static variable, modify one of its arguments, raise an exception, write data to a display or file, read data, or call other side-effecting functions.  In the presence of side effects, a program's behaviour may depend on history; that is, the order of evaluation matters.

Salian dynasty<====>29545<====>Salian dynasty  The Salian dynasty ( ; also known as the Frankish dynasty after the family's origin and position as dukes of Franconia) was a dynasty in the High Middle Ages.  The dynasty provided four German Kings (1024–1125), all of whom went on to be crowned Holy Roman Emperor (1027–1125); as such, the term Salic dynasty is also used to refer to the Holy Roman Empire of the time as a separate term. After the death of the last Saxon of the Ottonian Dynasty in 1024, the elective titles of King of the Germans and then three years later Holy Roman Emperor both passed to the first monarch of the Salian dynasty in the person of Conrad II, the only son of Count Henry of Speyer and Adelheid of Alsace (both territories in the Franconia of the day). 

Self-replication<====>29549<====>Self-replication  Self-replication is any behavior of a dynamical system that yields construction of an identical copy of itself.  Biological cells, given suitable environments, reproduce by cell division.  During cell division, DNA is replicated and can be transmitted to offspring during reproduction.  Biological viruses can replicate, but only by commandeering the reproductive machinery of cells through a process of infection.  Harmful prion proteins can replicate by converting normal proteins into rogue forms.   Computer viruses reproduce using the hardware and software already present on computers.  Self-replication in robotics has been an area of research and a subject of interest in science fiction.

Gavinus<====>29558<====>Gavinus Saint Gavinus ( ) is a Christian saint who is greatly celebrated in Sardinia, Italy, as one of the Martyrs of Torres ( ), along with his companions SS Protus and Januarius. He was probably a Roman soldier martyred for the Christian faith during the persecution of Diocletian in 304 in the city of Porto Torres ( ), according to the legend on the orders of the governor (preside) of Sardinia and Corsica, a certain Barbarus. The well-known Romanesque church of Gavoi is dedicated to him, as is the town of San Gavino Monreale, and a number of communes in Corsica. 

Sienna<====>29559<====>Sienna   Sienna (from  , "Siena earth") is an earth pigment containing iron oxide and manganese oxide.   In its natural state, it is yellow-brown and is called raw sienna.   When heated, it becomes a reddish brown and is called burnt sienna.  Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 5th Edition (2002)  It takes its name from the city-state of Siena, where it was produced during the Renaissance.   Along with ochre and umber,  it was one of the first pigments to be used by humans, and is found in many cave paintings.   Since the Renaissance, it has been one of the brown pigments most widely used by artists. 

Super Bowl XXXVI<====>29564<====>Super Bowl XXXVI  Super Bowl XXXVI was an American football game between the National Football Conference (NFC) champion St.  Louis Rams and the American Football Conference (AFC) champion New England Patriots to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2001 season.  The Patriots defeated the Rams 20–17.  It was New England's first Super Bowl championship, and the franchise's first league championship of any kind, having suffered two previous losses.  The game was played at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, on February 3, 2002.  Following the September 11 attacks earlier in the season, the NFL postponed a week of regular season games and moved the league's playoff schedule back.

DefinitionA communication with other populations, commercial trade, and military missions such as establishment of colonies. List scopeNecessarily the list can only relate to individuals and their missions which used watercraft for much of their duration.  Maritime exploration has not diminished in importance with the emergence of the aircraft, and remains an important part of contemporary scientific research. Although human maritime exploration is very ancient, only explorers known in recorded histories of their cultures are noted here. 

Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.<====>29577<====>Wednesday Morning, 3 A. M.  Wednesday Morning, 3 A. M.  is the debut studio album by American folk rock duo Simon & Garfunkel.  Following their early gig as "Tom and Jerry", Columbia Records signed the two in late 1963.  It was produced by Tom Wilson and engineered by Roy Halee.  The cover and the label include the subtitle exciting new sounds in the folk tradition.  Recorded in March 1964, the album was released on October 19. The album was initially unsuccessful, so Paul Simon moved to London, England, and Art Garfunkel continued his studies at Columbia University in their native New York City, before reuniting in late 1965. 

Sheldon Rampton<====>29578<====>Sheldon RamptonSheldon Rampton (born August 4, 1957) is an American editor and author.  He was editor of PR Watch, and is the author of several books that criticize the public relations industry and what he sees as other forms of corporate and government propaganda. EducationRampton was born in Long Beach, California.  At the age of one, his family moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, where his father worked as a musician.  Raised as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), he spent two years in Japan as a Latter-day Saint missionary from 1976 to 1978. 

Miller test<====>29579<====>Miller test  The Miller test, also called the three prong obscenity test, is the United States Supreme Court's test for determining whether speech or expression can be labeled obscene, in which case it is not protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and can be prohibited.    History and detailsThe Miller test was developed in the 1973 case Miller v.  California.   It has three parts:Whether "the average person, applying contemporary community standards", would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the   interest,Whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct or excretory functions  specifically defined by applicable state law,Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. 

Set-top box<====>29580<====>Set-top boxA set-top box (STB) or set-top unit (STU) (one type also colloquially known as a cable box) is an information appliance device that generally contains a TV-tuner input and displays output to a television set and an external source of signal, turning the source signal into content in a form that then be displayed on the television screen or other display device.  They are used in cable television, satellite television, and over-the-air television systems, as well as other uses. TV signal sourcesThe signal source might be an Ethernet cable, a satellite dish, a coaxial cable (see cable television), a telephone line (including DSL connections), broadband over power lines (BPL), or even an ordinary VHF or UHF antenna. 

Scatology<====>29582<====>Scatology    In medicine and biology, scatology or coprology is the study of feces. Scatological studies allow one to determine a wide range of biological information about a creature, including its diet (and thus where it has been), health and diseases such as tapeworms.  The word derives from the Greek   (   ) meaning "dung, feces"; coprology derives from the Greek   of similar meaning.    A comprehensive study of scatology was documented by John Gregory Bourke under the title   Rites of All Nations (1891).  An abbreviated version of the work (with a foreword by Sigmund Freud), was published as The Portable Scatalog in 1994. 

Sigma-algebra<====>29586<====>Sigma-algebra In mathematical analysis and in probability theory, a σ-algebra (also σ-field) on a set X is a collection Σ of subsets of X that includes the empty subset, is closed under complement, and is closed under countable unions and countable intersections.  The pair (X, Σ) is called a measurable space. A σ-algebra specializes the concept of a set algebra.  An algebra of sets needs only to be closed under the union or intersection of finitely many subsets.  The main use of σ-algebras is in the definition of measures; specifically, the collection of those subsets for which a given measure is defined is necessarily a σ-algebra. 

Second Battle of El Alamein<====>29587<====>Second Battle of El Alamein   The Second Battle of El Alamein (23 October–11 November 1942) was a battle of the Second World War that took place near the Egyptian railway halt of El Alamein.  With the Allies victorious, it was the watershed of the Western Desert Campaign.  The First Battle of El Alamein had prevented the Axis from advancing further into Egypt.  In August 1942, Lieutenant-General Sir Bernard Law Montgomery took command of the Eighth Army following the sacking of General Claude Auchinleck and the death of his replacement Lieutenant-General William Gott in a plane crash. 

Sextant<====>29588<====>Sextant A sextant is a doubly reflecting navigation instrument that measures the angular distance between two visible objects.  The primary use of a sextant is to measure the angle between an astronomical object and the horizon for the purposes of celestial navigation.  The estimation of this angle, the altitude,  is known as sighting or shooting the object, or taking a sight.  The angle, and the time when it was measured, can be used to calculate a position line on a nautical or aeronautical chart—for example, sighting the Sun at noon or Polaris at night (in the Northern Hemisphere) to estimate latitude. 

Single transferable vote<====>29589<====>Single transferable vote   The single transferable vote (STV) is a voting system designed to achieve proportional representation through ranked voting in multi-seat organizations or constituencies (voting districts).   Under STV, an elector (voter) has a single vote that is initially allocated to their most preferred candidate and, as the count proceeds and candidates are either elected or eliminated, is transferred to other candidates according to the voter's stated preferences, in proportion to any surplus or discarded votes.  The exact method of reapportioning votes can vary (see Counting methods). The system provides approximately proportional representation, enables votes to be cast for individual candidates rather than for parties, and—compared to first-past-the-post voting—reduces "wasted" votes (votes on sure losers or sure winners) by transferring them to other candidates. 

Stellarator<====>29591<====>StellaratorA stellarator is a device used to confine hot plasma with magnetic fields in order to sustain a controlled nuclear fusion reaction.  The name refers to the possibility of harnessing the power source of the sun, a stellar object.   It is one of the earliest fusion power devices, along with the z-pinch and magnetic mirror. The stellarator was invented by Lyman Spitzer of Princeton University in 1951, and much of its early development was carried out by his team at what became the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL).  The basic concept is to lay out the magnetic fields so that particles circulating around the long axis of the machine follow twisting paths, which cancels out instabilities seen in purely toroidal machines. 

SYSTRAN<====>29593<====>SYSTRANSYSTRAN, founded by Dr.  Peter Toma in 1968,  is one of the oldest machine translation companies.  SYSTRAN has done extensive work for the United States Department of Defense and the European Commission.  SYSTRAN provides the technology for Yahoo! Babel Fish among others.  It was used by Google's language tools until 2007.   SYSTRAN is used by the Dashboard Translation widget in OS X. Commercial versions of SYSTRAN can run on Microsoft Windows (including Windows Mobile), Linux, and Solaris.  Historically, SYSTRAN systems used Rule-based machine translation (RbMT) technology.  With the release of SYSTRAN Server 7 in 2010, SYSTRAN implemented a hybrid rule-based/Statistical machine translation (SMT) technology which was the first of its kind in the marketplace. 

Stephen I of Hungary<====>29594<====>Stephen I of Hungary    Stephen I, also known as King Saint Stephen ( ;  ;  ;   975 – 15 August 1038 AD), was the last Grand Prince of the Hungarians between 997 and 1000 or 1001, and the first King of Hungary from 1000 or 1001 until his death in 1038.  The year of his birth is uncertain, but many details of his life suggest that he was born in or after 975 in Esztergom.  At his birth, he was given the pagan name Vajk.  The date of his baptism is unknown. 

San Giovanni di Posada<====>29602<====>San Giovanni di PosadaSan Giovanni di Posada (Latin: Portus Luguidonis or Portus Liquidonis ) is a frazione and small village in Sardinia, Italy, on the Tyrrhenian coast of the island, in the territory of the comune of Posada. Formerly known as Marina di Posada, it underwent rebuilding in the 1970s as an elegant residential village for holidays. Its history goes back to the Roman harbour (named "Portus Luguidonis" - presumably located in the little bay in front of the ancient church of St.  John), from where the Romans entered inner Sardinia.  Through  this harbour passed all the goods to or from Rome, but all the cargo was carried by small and light ships directed to Olbia (some 50km north), where bigger ships would have trafficked with Ostia. 

Scott Joplin<====>29603<====>Scott Joplin    Scott Joplin ( ;   1867/68 or November 24, 1868– April 1, 1917) was an American composer and pianist.  Joplin achieved fame for his ragtime compositions and was dubbed the "King of Ragtime".   During his brief career, he wrote 44 original ragtime pieces, one ragtime ballet, and two operas.  One of his first, and most popular pieces, the "Maple Leaf Rag", became ragtime's first and most influential hit, and has been recognized as the archetypal rag.  Joplin was born into a musical family of railway laborers in Northeast Texas, and developed his musical knowledge with the help of local teachers. 

Syncopation<====>29605<====>Syncopation In music, syncopation involves a variety of rhythms which are in some way unexpected which make part or all of a tune or piece of music off-beat.  More simply, syncopation is a general term for "a disturbance or interruption of the regular flow of rhythm": a "placement of rhythmic stresses or accents where they wouldn't normally occur. "    The correlation of at least two sets of time intervals.   Also known as an "Uneven movement from bar to bar". Syncopation is used in many musical styles, especially dance music--"All dance music makes use of syncopation and it's often a vital element that helps tie the whole track together". 

Strategy<====>29607<====>Strategy   Strategy (from Greek στρατηγία stratēgia, "art of troop leader; office of general, command, generalship" ) is a high level plan to achieve one or more goals under conditions of uncertainty.  In the sense of the "art of the general", which included several subsets of skills including "tactics", siegecraft, logistics etc. , the term came into use in the 6th century C. E.  in East Roman terminology, and was translated into Western vernacular languages only in the 18th century.  From then until the 20th century, the word "strategy" came to denote "a comprehensive way to try to pursue political ends, including the threat or actual use of force, in a dialectic of wills" in a military conflict, in which both adversaries interact. 

Saeed al-Ghamdi<====>29608<====>Saeed al-Ghamdi  Saeed Abdallah Ali Sulayman al-Ghamdi ( ,  ) (November 21, 1979 – September 11, 2001) was one of four hijackers of United Airlines Flight 93 as part of the September 11 attacks.  Born in Saudi Arabia, Ghamdi left his home to fight in Chechnya after dropping out of college, but was reported to have diverted to Afghanistan to train in an al-Qaeda camp.  It was reported he was chosen by Osama bin Laden to participate in terrorist attacks in the United States and arrived in the U. S.  in June 2001.  During his stay in the U. 

Syncretism<====>29612<====>Syncretism  Syncretism ( ) is the combining of different beliefs, while blending practices of various schools of thought.  Syncretism involves the merging or assimilation  of several originally discrete traditions, especially in the theology and mythology of religion, thus asserting an underlying unity and allowing for an inclusive approach to other faiths.  Syncretism also occurs commonly in expressions of arts and culture (known as eclecticism) as well as politics (syncretic politics). NomenclatureThe English word is first attested in the early 17th century,  from   Modern Latin syncretismus, drawing on Greek συγκρητισμός (synkretismos), supposedly meaning "Cretan federation", but this is a spurious etymology from the naive idea in Plutarch's 1st-century AD essay on "Fraternal Love (Peri Philadelphias)" in his collection Moralia (2. 

S7G reactor<====>29614<====>S7G reactorThe S7G reactor was a prototype naval reactor designed for the United States Navy to provide electricity generation and propulsion on warships.   The S7G designation stands for:S = Submarine platform7 = Seventh reactor designed by the contractorG = General Electric was the contracted designerThis prototype design was a land-based nuclear reactor that did not use control rods.   It was tested in the late 1970s and early 1980s at the Modifications and Additions to a Reactor Facility (MARF) plant located at the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory's Kesselring Site in Ballston Spa, New York.   It consisted of an experimental reactor core installed in a modified S5W reactor plant. 

Subject–verb–object<====>29617<====>Subject–verb–object  In linguistic typology, subject–verb–object (SVO) is a sentence structure where the subject comes first, the verb second, and the object third.  Languages may be classified according to the dominant sequence of these elements in unmarked sentences (i. e.  sentences in which an unusual word order is not used for emphasis).  The label is often used for ergative languages which do not have subjects, but have an agent–verb–object order. SVO is used in the active voice.  SVO is the second-most common order by number of known languages, after SOV.  Together, SVO and SOV account for more than 75% of the world's languages. 

Skopje<====>29618<====>Skopje    Skopje  (   ) is the capital and largest city of the Republic of Macedonia.  It is the country's political, cultural, economic, and academic center.  It was known in the Roman period under the name Scupi. The territory of Skopje has been inhabited since at least 4000 BC; remains of Neolithic settlements have been found within the old Kale Fortress that overlooks the modern city centre.  Scupi became the capital of Dardania in the second century BC.  On the eve of the 1st century AD, the settlement was seized by the Romans and became a military camp. 

Speed metal<====>29622<====>Speed metal   Speed metal is a subgenre of heavy metal music that originated in the late 1970s from new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) roots.  It is described by AllMusic as "extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding" music.    "It is usually considered less abrasive and more melodic than thrash metal, showing less influence from hardcore punk.  However, speed metal is usually faster and more aggressive than traditional heavy metal, also showing more inclination to virtuoso soloing and featuring short instrumental passages between couplets.  Speed metal songs frequently make use of highly expressive vocals, but are usually less likely to employ 'harsh' vocals than thrash metal songs. 

Stan Rogers<====>29630<====>Stan Rogers   Stanley Allison "Stan" Rogers (November 29, 1949 – June 2, 1983) was a Canadian folk musician and songwriter. Rogers was noted for his rich, baritone voice and his traditional-sounding songs which were frequently inspired by Canadian history and the daily lives of working people, especially those from the fishing villages of the Maritime provinces and, later, the farms of the Canadian prairies and Great Lakes.  Rogers died in a fire aboard Air Canada Flight 797 on the ground at the Greater Cincinnati Airport at the age of 33. Early life and musical developmentRogers was born in Hamilton, Ontario  the eldest son of Nathan Allison "Al" and Valerie Rogers (née Bushell), two Maritimers who had relocated to Ontario in search of work shortly after their marriage in July 1948. 

Sacramento, California<====>29631<====>Sacramento, California    Sacramento ( ;  ) is the capital city of the U. S.  state of California and the seat of Sacramento County.  It is at the confluence of the Sacramento River and the American River in the northern portion of California's expansive Central Valley, known as the Sacramento Valley.  Its estimated 2016 population of 493,025 makes it the sixth-largest city in California, the fastest-growing big city in the state,  and the 35th largest city in the United States.    Sacramento is the cultural and economic core of the Sacramento metropolitan area, which includes seven counties with a 2010 population of 2,414,783. 

Sierpinski carpet<====>29635<====>Sierpinski carpetThe Sierpinski carpet is a plane fractal first described by Wacław Sierpiński in 1916.   The carpet is one generalization of the Cantor set to two dimensions; another is the Cantor dust. The technique of subdividing a shape into smaller copies of itself, removing one or more copies, and continuing recursively can be extended to other shapes.  For instance, subdividing an equilateral triangle into four equilateral triangles, removing the middle triangle, and recursing leads to the Sierpinski triangle.  In three dimensions, a similar construction based on cubes produces the Sierpinski sponge and the Menger sponge. ConstructionThe construction of the Sierpinski carpet begins with a square. 

Subspace<====>29637<====>Subspace Subspace may refer to: In mathematicsA space inheriting all characteristics of a parent space.A subset of a topological space endowed with the subspace topologyLinear subspace, in linear algebra, a subset of a vector space that is closed under addition and scalar multiplicationFlat (geometry), a Euclidean subspaceAffine subspace,  a geometric structure that generalizes the affine properties of a flatProjective subspace, a geometric structure that generalizes a linear subspace of a vector spaceMultilinear subspace in multilinear algebra, a subset of a tensor space that is closed under addition and scalar multiplicationIn science fictionSubspace (fictional) or hyperspace, a fictional parallel universeSubspace (Star Trek), a fictional feature of space-time that facilitates faster-than-light communication and transitIn gamesSubSpace (video game), a two-dimensional space shooter computer gameThe Subspace Emissary, the two player Adventure mode in the video game Super Smash Bros.

Sierpinski triangle<====>29638<====>Sierpinski triangleThe Sierpinski triangle (also with the original orthography Sierpiński), also called the Sierpinski gasket or the Sierpinski Sieve,  is a fractal and attractive fixed set with the overall shape of an equilateral triangle, subdivided recursively into smaller equilateral triangles.  Originally constructed as a curve, this is one of the basic examples of self-similar sets, i. e. , it is a mathematically generated pattern that can be reproducible at any magnification or reduction.  It is named after the Polish mathematician Wacław Sierpiński, but appeared as a decorative pattern many centuries prior to the work of Sierpiński.   ConstructionsThere are many different ways of constructing the Sierpinski triangle. 

Siberia<====>29639<====>Siberia    Siberia ( ;  ) is an extensive geographical region, and by the broadest definition is also known as North Asia.  Siberia has historically been a part of Russia since the 16th and 17th centuries. The territory of Siberia extends eastwards from the Ural Mountains to the watershed between the Pacific and Arctic drainage basins.  The Yenisei River conditionally divides Siberia into five parts, Western and Eastern.  Siberia stretches southwards from the Arctic Ocean to the hills of north-central Kazakhstan and to the national borders of Mongolia and China.   With an area of  , Siberia accounts for 77% of Russia's land area, but it is home to just 40 million people—27% of the country's population. 

Standard Arabic Technical Transliteration System<====>29640<====>Standard Arabic Technical Transliteration System  The Standard Arabic Technical Transliteration System, commonly referred to by its acronym SATTS, is a system for writing and transmitting Arabic language text using the one-for-one substitution of ASCII-range characters for the letters of the Arabic alphabet.  Unlike more common systems for transliterating Arabic, SATTS does not provide the reader with any more phonetic information than standard Arabic orthography does; that is, it provides the bare Arabic alphabetic spelling with no notation of short vowels, doubled consonants, etc.  In other words, it is intended as a transliteration tool for Arabic linguists, and is of limited use to those who do not know Arabic. 

Sound change<====>29641<====>Sound change    Sound change includes any processes of language change that affect pronunciation (phonetic change) or sound system structures (phonological change).  Sound change can consist of the replacement of one speech sound (or, more generally, one phonetic feature value) by another, the complete loss of the affected sound, or even the introduction of a new sound in a place where there had been none.  Sound changes can be environmentally conditioned, meaning that the change only occurs in a defined sound environment, whereas in other environments the same speech sound is not affected by the change. 

Sulpicius Severus<====>29644<====>Sulpicius Severus Sulpicius Severus ( ; c.  363 – c.  425) was a Christian writer and native of Aquitania    in modern-day France.  He is known for his chronicle of sacred history, as well as his biography of Saint Martin of Tours. LifeAlmost all that we know of Severus' life comes from a few allusions in his own writings, some passages in the letters of his friend Paulinus, bishop of Nola,  and a short biography by the historian Gennadius of Massilia. Born of noble parents in Aquitaine, Severus enjoyed excellent educational advantages.  He was imbued with the culture of his time and of his country, a center of Latin letters and learning. 

Scared to Death<====>29645<====>Scared to Death  Scared to Death is a 1947 thriller film directed by Christy Cabanne and starring Bela Lugosi.  The picture was filmed in Cinecolor.  The film is historically important as the only color film in which Bela Lugosi has a starring role.   Plot The film opens with the disclosure by morgue examiners that a beautiful woman has literally died of fright.  The plot reveals how she reached the fatal stage of terror.   The woman is married to the son of a doctor, the proprietor of a private sanatorium, where she is under unwilling treatment. 

Stefan Banach<====>29646<====>Stefan Banach Stefan Banach ( ; 30 March 1892 – 31 August 1945) was a Polish mathematician who is generally considered one of the world's most important and influential 20th-century mathematicians.   He was one of the founders of modern functional analysis, and an original member of the Lwów School of Mathematics.  His major work was the 1932 book, Théorie des opérations linéaires (Theory of Linear Operations), the first monograph on the general theory of functional analysis. Born in Kraków, Banach attended IV Gymnasium, a secondary school, and worked on mathematics problems with his friend  .  After graduating in 1910, Banach moved to Lwów. 

Single-lens reflex camera<====>29648<====>Single-lens reflex cameraA single-lens reflex camera (SLR) is a camera that typically uses a mirror and prism system (hence "reflex" from the mirror's reflection) that permits the photographer to view through the lens and see exactly what will be captured.  With twin lens reflex and rangefinder cameras, the viewed image could be significantly different from the final image.  When the shutter button is pressed on a mechanical SLR, the mirror flips out of the light path, allowing light to pass through to the light receptor and the image to be captured.

Senary<====>29652<====>Senary The senary numeral system (also known as base-6 or heximal) has six as its base. It has been adopted independently by a small number of cultures. Like decimal, it is a semiprime, though being the product of the only two consecutive numbers that are both prime (2 and 3) it has a high degree of mathematical properties for its size.  As six is a superior highly composite number, many of the arguments made in favor of the duodecimal system also apply to this base-6.Mathematical propertiesSenary multiplication table×  1  2  3 4  5  10 1 1  2  3  4  5  10 2 2  4  10  12  14  20 3 3  10  13  20  23  30 4 4  12  20  24  32  40 5 5  14  23  32  41  50 10 10  20  30  40  50  100 Senary may be considered interesting in the study of prime numbers, since all primes other than 2 and 3, when expressed in senary, have 1 or 5 as the final digit. In senary the prime numbers are written2, 3, 5, 11, 15, 21, 25, 31, 35, 45, 51, 101, 105, 111, 115, 125, 135, 141, 151, 155, 201, 211, 215, 225, 241, 245, 251, 255, 301, 305, 331, 335, 345, 351, 405, 411, 421, 431, 435, 445, 455, 501, 515, 521, 525, 531, 551, ...  That is, for every prime number p greater than 3, one has the modular arithmetic relations that either p ≡ 1 or 5 (mod 6) (that is, 6 divides either p − 1 or p − 5); the final digit is a 1 or a 5. This is proved by contradiction.For any integer n:If n ≡ 0 (mod 6), 6 | nIf n ≡ 2 (mod 6), 2 | nIf n ≡ 3 (mod 6), 3 | nIf n ≡ 4 (mod 6), 2 | nAdditionally, since the smallest four primes (2, 3, 5, 7) are either divisors or neighbors of 6, senary has simple divisibility tests for many numbers.Furthermore, all even perfect numbers besides 6 have 44 as the final two digits when expressed in senary, which is proven by the fact that every even perfect number is of the form 2 p−1 (2 p −1), where 2 p −1 is prime.Senary is also the largest number base r that has no totatives other than 1 and r − 1, making its multiplication table highly regular for its size, minimizing the amount of effort required to memorize its table.  This property maximizes the probability that the result of an integer multiplication will end in zero, given that neither of its factors do.FractionsBecause six is the product of the first two prime numbers and is adjacent to the next two prime numbers, many senary fractions have simple representations:Decimal base  Prime factors of the base:  2 ,  5    Prime factors of one below the base:  3    Prime factors of one above the base:  11Senary base  Prime factors of the base:  2 ,  3    Prime factors of one below the base:  5    Prime factors of one above the base:  11Fraction  Prime factors of the denominator  Positional representation Positional representation  Prime factors of the denominator  Fraction 1/2  2  0.5 0.3  2  1/2 1/3  3  0.3333... = 0.  0.2  3  1/3 1/4  2  0.25 0.13  2  1/4 1/5  5  0.2 0.1111... = 0.   5  1/5 1/6  2 ,  3  0.1  0.1  2 ,  3  1/10 1/7  7  0.  0.   11  1/11 1/8  2  0.125 0.043  2  1/12 1/9  3  0.  0.04  3  1/13 1/10  2 ,  5  0.1 0.0   2 ,  5  1/14 1/11  11  0.  0.   15  1/15 1/12  2 ,  3  0.08  0.03  2 ,  3  1/20 1/13  13  0.  0.   21  1/21 1/14  2 ,  7  0.0  0.0   2 ,  11  1/22 1/15  3 ,  5  0.0  0.0   3 ,  5  1/23 1/16  2  0.0625 0.0213  2  1/24 1/17  17  0.  0.   25  1/25 1/18  2 ,  3  0.0  0.02  2 ,  3  1/30 1/19  19  0.  0.   31  1/31 1/20  2 ,  5  0.05 0.01   2 ,  5  1/32 1/21  3 ,  7  0.  0.0   3 ,  11  1/33 1/22  2 ,  11  0.0  0.0   2 ,  15  1/34 1/23  23  0.  0.   35  1/35 1/24  2 ,  3  0.041  0.013  2 ,  3  1/40 1/25  5  0.04 0.   5  1/41 1/26  2 ,  13  0.0  0.0   2 ,  21  1/42 1/27  3  0.  0.012  3  1/43 1/28  2 ,  7  0.03  0.01   2 ,  11  1/44 1/29  29  0.  0.   45  1/45 1/30  2 ,  3 ,  5  0.0  0.0   2 ,  3 ,  5  1/50 1/31  31  0.  0.   51  1/51 1/32  2  0.03125 0.01043  2  1/52 1/33  3 ,  11  0.  0.0   3 ,  15  1/53 1/34  2 ,  17  0.0  0.0   2 ,  25  1/54 1/35  5 ,  7  0.0  0.   5 ,  11  1/55 1/36  2 ,  3  0.02  0.01  2 ,  3  1/100 Finger counting  Each regular human hand may be said to have six unambiguous positions; a fist, one finger (or thumb) extended, two, three, four and then all five extended.If the right hand is used to represent a unit, and the left to represent the 'sixes', it becomes possible for one person to represent the values from zero to 55 senary  (35 decimal ) with their fingers, rather than the usual ten obtained in standard finger counting. e.g. if three fingers are extended on the left hand and four on the right, 34 senary  is represented. This is equivalent to 3 × 6 + 4 which is 22 decimal .Which hand is used for the 'sixes' and which the units is down to preference on the part of the counter, however when viewed from the counter's perspective, using the left hand as the most significant digit correlates with the written representation of the same senary number.  Flipping the 'sixes' hand around to its backside may help to further disambiguate which hand represents the 'sixes' and which represents the units.Additionally, this method is the least abstract way to count using two hands that reflects the concept of positional notation, as the movement from one position to the next is done by switching from one hand to another.  While most developed cultures count by fingers up to 5 in very similar ways, beyond 5 non-Western cultures deviate from Western methods, such as with Chinese number gestures.  As senary finger counting also deviates only beyond 5, this counting method rivals the simplicity of traditional counting methods, a fact which may have implications for the teaching of positional notion to young students.In NCAA basketball, the players' uniform numbers are restricted to be senary numbers of at most two digits, so that the referees can signal which player committed an infraction by using this finger-counting system. More abstract finger counting systems, such as chisanbop or finger binary, allow counting to 99, 1,023, or even higher depending on the method (though not necessarily senary in nature). The English monk and historian Bede, in the first chapter of De temporum ratione, (725), titled "Tractatus de computo, vel loquela per gestum digitorum,"  allowed counting up to 9,999 on two hands. Natural languagesDespite the rarity of cultures that group large quantities by 6, a review of the development of numeral systems suggests a threshold of numerosity at 6 (possibly being conceptualized as "whole", "fist", or "beyond five fingers" ), with 1–6 often being pure forms, and numerals thereafter being constructed or borrowed.   The Ndom language of Papua New Guinea is reported to have senary numerals.   Mer means 6, mer an thef means 6 × 2 = 12, nif means 36, and nif thef means 36 × 2 = 72.Another example from Papua New Guinea are the Morehead-Maro languages. In these languages, counting is connected to ritualized yam-counting. These languages count from a base six, employing words for the powers of six; running up to 6 6  for some of the languages. One example is Kómnzo with the following numerals: nimbo (6 1 ), féta (6 2 ), tarumba (6 3 ), ntamno (6 4 ), wärämäkä (6 5 ), wi (6 6 ).Some Niger-Congo languages have been reported to use a senary number system, usually in addition to another, such as decimal or vigesimal. Proto-Uralic has also been suspected to have had senary numerals, with a numeral for 7 being borrowed later, though evidence for constructing larger numerals (8 and 9) subtractively from ten suggests that this may not be so. Base 36 as senary compressionFor some purposes, base 6 might be too small a base for convenience. This can be worked around by using its square, base 36 (hexatrigesimal), as then conversion is facilitated by simply making the following replacements:Decimal 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17 Base 6  0  1  2  3  4  5  10  11  12  13  14  15  20  21  22  23  24  25 Base 36   0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H    Decimal 18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35 Base 6  30  31  32  33  34  35  40  41  42  43  44  45  50  51  52  53  54  55 Base 36   I    J    K    L    M    N    O    P    Q    R    S    T    U    V    W    X    Y    Z   Thus, the base-36 number WIKIPEDIA 36  is equal to the senary number 523032304122213014 6 . In decimal, it is 91,730,738,691,298. The choice of 36 as a radix is convenient in that the digits can be represented using the Arabic numerals 0–9 and the Latin letters A–Z: this choice is the basis of the base36 encoding scheme. The compression effect of 36 being the square of 6 causes a lot of patterns and representations to be shorter in base 36:1/9 10  = 0.04 6  = 0.4 36 1/16 10  = 0.0213 6  = 0.29 36 1/5 10  = 0.  6  = 0.  36 1/7 10  = 0.  6  = 0.  36 See alsoDiceware method to encode base-6 values into pronounceable passwords.Base36 encoding schemeRelated number systemsBinary (base 2)Ternary (base 3)Duodecimal (base 12)Sexagesimal (base 60)References External linksShack's Base Six DialecticDigital base 6 clockAnalog Clock Designer capable of rendering a base 6 clockSenary base conversion

Ballmer was hired by Bill Gates at Microsoft in 1980 after dropping out of Stanford University.  He eventually became President in 1998, and replaced Gates as CEO in 2000. 

Salamander<====>29657<====>SalamanderSalamanders are a group of amphibians typically characterized by a lizard-like appearance, with slender bodies, blunt snouts, short limbs projecting at right angles to the body, and the presence of a tail in both larvae and adults.  All present-day salamander families are grouped together under the scientific name Urodela.  Salamander diversity is most abundant in the Northern Hemisphere and most species are found in the Holarctic ecozone, with some species present in the Neotropical zone. Salamanders rarely have more than four toes on their front legs and five on their rear legs, but some species have fewer digits and others lack hind limbs. 

State terrorism<====>29660<====>State terrorism   State terrorism refers to acts of terrorism conducted by a state against foreign targets or against its own people.Martin, 2006: p.  111.   Definition There is neither an academic nor an international legal consensus regarding the proper definition of the word "terrorism".    Many scholars believe that the actions of governments can be labelled "terrorism".   For example, using the term 'terrorism' to mean violent action used with the predominant intention of causing terror, Paul James and Jonathan Friedman distinguish between state terrorism against non-combatants and state terrorism against combatants, including 'Shock and Awe' tactics: "Shock and Awe" as a subcategory of "rapid dominance" is the name given to massive intervention designed to strike terror into the minds of the enemy.

Counts Palatine of SaxonySee Counts Palatine of SaxonyIn the 10th century the Emperor Otto I created the County Palatine of Saxony in the Saale-Unstrut area of southern Saxony.  The honour was initially held by a Count of Hessengau, then from the early 11th century by the Counts of Goseck, later by the Counts of Sommerschenburg, and still later by the Landgraves of Thuringia. 

Supply and demand<====>29664<====>Supply and demand  In microeconomics, supply and demand is an economic model of price determination in a market.  It postulates that in a competitive market, the unit price for a particular good, or other traded item such as labor or liquid financial assets, will vary until it settles at a point where the quantity demanded (at the current price) will equal the quantity supplied (at the current price), resulting in an economic equilibrium for price and quantity transacted. Graphical representationsAlthough it is normal to regard the quantity demanded  and the quantity supplied as functions of the price of the goods, the standard graphical representation, usually attributed to Alfred Marshall, has price on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis. 

State capitalism<====>29665<====>State capitalism  State capitalism is an economic system in which the state undertakes commercial (i. e. , for-profit) economic activity, and where the means of production are organized and managed as state-owned business enterprises (including the processes of capital accumulation, wage labor, and centralized management), or where there is otherwise a dominance of corporatized government agencies (agencies organized along business-management practices) or of publicly listed corporations in which the state has controlling shares.  Compare:  Marxist literature defines state capitalism as a social system combining capitalism with ownership or control by a state; by this definition, a state capitalist country is one where the government controls the economy and essentially acts like a single huge corporation, extracting the surplus value from the workforce in order to invest it in further production. 

Syringomyelia<====>29666<====>Syringomyelia Syringomyelia is a generic term referring to a disorder in which a cyst or cavity forms within the spinal cord.  This cyst, called a syrinx, can expand and elongate over time, destroying the spinal cord.  The damage may result in loss of pain, paralysis, weakness,  and stiffness in the back, shoulders, and extremities.  Syringomyelia may also cause a loss of the ability to feel extremes of hot or cold, especially in the hands.  It may also lead to a cape-like bilateral loss of pain and temperature sensation along the upper chest and arms.  Each patient experiences a different combination of symptoms. 

Sacha Pecaric<====>29668<====>Sacha Pecaric  Sacha Pecaric (born 1965 in Rijeka) is a Croatian born rabbi. After studies in Prague, Pecaric continued to study at the rabbinic department of the Yeshiva University (where he obtained rabbinical ordination) in New York City and the department of philosophy of the Columbia University (M. A. ) and FAMU Charles University (Ph. D. ).  He lived in Kraków where he ran the Ronald S.  Lauder Foundation aimed at providing education to the small local Jewish community as well as local Gentiles, and where he set up Pardes Lauder, a Jewish religious publishing house which has so far published more than 30 books, including a prayer book and Haggada for Passover. 

Sergio Aragonés<====>29669<====>Sergio Aragonés  Sergio Aragonés Domenech ( ; born September 6, 1937)  is a Spanish/Mexican cartoonist and writer best known for his contributions to Mad magazine and creator of the comic book Groo the Wanderer. Among his peers and fans, Aragonés is widely regarded as "the world's fastest cartoonist".   The Comics Journal has described Aragonés as "one of the most prolific and brilliant cartoonists of his generation".Mad editor Al Feldstein said, "He could have drawn the whole magazine if we'd let him. " Early lifeBorn in Sant Mateu, Castellón, Spain, Aragonés emigrated with his family to France, due to the Spanish Civil War, before settling in Mexico at age 6. 

Trade<====>29678<====>Trade  Trade involves the transfer of goods or services from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for money.  A system or network that allows trade is called a market. The original form of trade, barter, saw the direct exchange of goods and services for other goods and services. Barter involves trading things without the use of money.    Later one bartering party started to involve precious metals, which gained symbolic as well as practical importance.  Modern traders generally negotiate through a medium of exchange, such as money. 

Tambourine<====>29680<====>Tambourine   The tambourine is a musical instrument in the percussion family consisting of a frame, often of wood or plastic, with pairs of small metal jingles, called "zils".  Classically the term tambourine denotes an instrument with a drumhead, though some variants may not have a head at all.  Tambourines are often used with regular percussion sets.  They can be mounted, for example on a stand as part of a drum kit (and played with drum sticks), or they can be held in the hands and played by tapping or hitting the instrument. Tambourines come in many shapes with the most common being circular. 

Tennis<====>29773<====>Tennis  Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles).  Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court.  The object of the game is to play the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return.  The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.

She is known for starring as Kelly Kapowski on NBC's Saved by the Bell (1989–93) and as Valerie Malone on Fox's Beverly Hills, 90210 (1994–98), two TV series that met with great success.  Thiessen has also starred in other TV series such as Fox's Fastlane (2002–03), ABC's What About Brian (2007), and USA Network's White Collar (2009–14), as well as in a number of TV movies, and she has also appeared in several films like Son in Law (1993), Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth (2000), Hollywood Ending (2002), and Cyborg Soldier (2008). 

Thomas Edison<====>29778<====>Thomas EdisonThomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 October 18, 1931) was an American inventor and businessman, who has been described as America's greatest inventor.

Tai–Kadai languages<====>29811<====>Tai–Kadai languages The Tai–Kadai languages, also known as Kra–Dai, Daic, and Kadai, are a language family of highly tonal languages found in southern China, northeast India and Southeast Asia.  They include Thai and Lao, the national languages of Thailand and Laos respectively.   Around 93 million people speak Tai-Kadai languages, 60% of whom speak Thai.   Ethnologue lists 95 languages in this family, with 62 of these being in the Tai branch.  The diversity of the Tai–Kadai languages in southern China, especially in Guizhou and Hainan, suggests that this is close to their homeland.  The Tai branch moved south into Southeast Asia only about a thousand years ago, founding the nations that later became Thailand and Laos in what had been Austroasiatic territory.

Technology<====>29816<====>TechnologyTechnology ("science of craft", from Greek  , techne, "art, skill, cunning of hand"; and  ,) is the collection of techniques, skills,  , and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation.  Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings. The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools.  The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment.

Hobbes is best known for his 1651 book Leviathan, which established the social contract theory that has served as the foundation for most later Western political philosophy.   In addition to political philosophy, Hobbes also contributed to a diverse array of other fields, including history, jurisprudence, geometry, the physics of gases, theology, ethics, and general philosophy. 

Terraforming<====>29824<====>Terraforming   Terraforming (literally, "Earth-shaping") of a planet, moon, or other body is the hypothetical process of deliberately modifying its atmosphere, temperature, surface topography or ecology to be similar to the environment of Earth to make it habitable by Earth-like life. The concept of terraforming developed from both science fiction and actual science.  The term was coined by Jack Williamson in a science-fiction story (Collision Orbit) published during 1942 in Astounding Science Fiction,  but the concept may pre-date this work. Based on experiences with Earth, the environment of a planet can be altered deliberately; however, the feasibility of creating an unconstrained planetary environment that mimics Earth on another planet has yet to be verified. 

Trial de novo<====>29826<====>Trial de novo   In law, the expression trial de novo means a "new trial" by a different tribunal (de novo is a Latin expression meaning "afresh", "anew", "beginning again", hence the literal meaning "new trial").  A trial de novo is usually ordered by an appellate court when the original trial failed to make a determination in a manner dictated by law. Common lawIn common law systems, one feature that distinguishes an appellate proceeding from a trial de novo is that new evidence may not ordinarily be presented in an appeal, though there are rare instances when it may be allowed—usually evidence that came to light only after the trial and could not, in all diligence, have been presented in the lower court.

The term "time machine", coined by Wells, is now almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle.  The Time Machine has been adapted into three feature films of the same name, as well as two television versions, and a large number of comic book adaptations. 

Trombone<====>29837<====>Trombone  The trombone is a musical instrument in the brass family.  Like all brass instruments, sound is produced when the player's vibrating lips (embouchure) cause the air column inside the instrument to vibrate.  Nearly all trombones have a telescoping slide mechanism that varies the length of the instrument to change the pitch.  Many modern trombone models also utilize a rotary valve as a means to lower pitch of the instrument.  Variants such as the valve trombone and superbone have three valves like those on the trumpet. The word trombone derives from Italian tromba (trumpet) and -one (a suffix meaning "large"), so the name means "large trumpet".

[1]Rabbinic Judaism describes seven names which are so holy that, once written, should not be erased: The Tetragrammaton written as YHWH and six others which can be categorized as titles are El ("God"), Eloah ("God"), Elohim ("Gods"), Shaddai ("God Almighty"), Ehyeh, and Tzevaot ("[of] Hosts"). 

Trick-taking game<====>29947<====>Trick-taking game A trick-taking game is a card game or tile-based game in which play of a "hand" centers on a series of finite rounds or units of play, called tricks, which are each evaluated to determine a winner or "taker" of that trick.  The object of such games then may be closely tied to the number of tricks taken, as in plain-trick games such as Whist, contract bridge, Spades, Napoleon, Euchre, Rowboat, Clubs and Spoil Five, or to the value of the cards contained in taken tricks, as in point-trick games such as Pinochle, the Tarot family, Mariage, Rook, All Fours, Manille, Briscola, and most "evasion" games like Hearts.

Thermodynamics<====>29952<====>Thermodynamics  Thermodynamics is a branch of physics concerned with heat and temperature and their relation to energy and work.  The behavior of these quantities is governed by the four laws of thermodynamics, irrespective of the composition or specific properties of the material or system in question.   The laws of thermodynamics are explained in terms of microscopic constituents by statistical mechanics.   Thermodynamics applies to a wide variety of topics in science and engineering, especially physical chemistry, chemical engineering and mechanical engineering. Historically, thermodynamics developed out of a desire to increase the efficiency of early steam engines, particularly through the work of French physicist Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot (1824) who believed that engine efficiency was the key that could help France win the Napoleonic Wars. 

Topology<====>29954<====>Topology    In mathematics, topology (from the Greek τόπος, place, and λόγος, study) is concerned with the properties of space that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching, crumpling and bending, but not tearing or gluing.  This can be studied by considering a collection of subsets, called open sets, that satisfy certain properties, turning the given set into what is known as a topological space.  Important topological properties include connectedness and compactness.  Topology developed as a field of study out of geometry and set theory, through analysis of concepts such as space, dimension, and transformation. 

Troll<====>29957<====>Troll    A troll is a class of being in Norse mythology and Scandinavian folklore.  In Old Norse sources, beings described as trolls dwell in isolated rocks, mountains, or caves, live together in small family units, and are rarely helpful to human beings. Later, in Scandinavian folklore, trolls became beings in their own right, where they live far from human habitation, are not Christianized, and are considered dangerous to human beings.  Depending on the source, their appearance varies greatly; trolls may be ugly and slow-witted, or look and behave exactly like human beings, with no particularly grotesque characteristic about them. 

Trade secret<====>29960<====>Trade secret  A trade secret is a formula, practice, process, design, instrument, pattern, commercial method, or compilation of information not generally known or reasonably ascertainable by others by which a business can obtain an economic advantage over competitors or customers.   In some jurisdictions, such secrets are referred to as "confidential information" but are generally not referred to as "classified information" in the United States, since that refers to government secrets protected by a different set of laws and practices. DefinitionThe precise language by which a trade secret is defined varies by jurisdiction (as do the particular types of information that are subject to trade secret protection). 

Tensor<====>29965<====>Tensor In mathematics, tensors are geometric objects that describe linear relations between geometric vectors, scalars, and other tensors.   Elementary examples of such relations include the dot product, the cross product, and linear maps.   Geometric vectors, often used in physics and engineering applications, and scalars themselves are also tensors.    A more sophisticated example is the Cauchy stress tensor T, which takes a direction v as input and produces the stress T (v)  on the surface normal to this vector for output, thus expressing a relationship between these two vectors, shown in the figure (right). 

Tarragon<====>29967<====>Tarragon Tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus), also known as estragon, is a species of perennial herb in the sunflower family.  It is widespread in the wild across much of Eurasia and North America, and is cultivated for culinary and medicinal purposes.One subspecies, Artemisia dracunculus var.  sativa, is cultivated for use of the leaves as an aromatic culinary herb.  In some other subspecies, the characteristic aroma is largely absent.  The species is polymorphic.   Informal names for distinguishing the variations include "French tarragon" (best for culinary use ), "Russian tarragon," and "wild tarragon" (covers various states). 

Thyme<====>29968<====>Thyme Thyme ( ) is an aromatic perennial evergreen herb with culinary, medicinal, and ornamental uses.  The most common variety is Thymus vulgaris.  Thyme is of the genus Thymus of the mint family (Lamiaceae), and a relative of the oregano genus Origanum. HistoryAncient Egyptians used thyme for embalming.    The ancient Greeks used it in their baths and burnt it as incense in their temples, believing it was a source of courage.   The spread of thyme throughout Europe was thought to be due to the Romans, as they used it to purify their rooms and to "give an aromatic flavour to cheese and liqueurs". 

Tea<====>29969<====>Tea Tea is an aromatic beverage commonly prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured leaves of the Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub (bush) native to Asia.   After water, it is the most widely consumed drink in the world.There are many different types of tea; some, like Darjeeling and Chinese greens, have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent flavour,    while others have vastly different profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral or grassy notes. Tea originated in Southwest China, where it was used as a medicinal drink. 

Tank<====>29970<====>Tank   A tank is an armoured fighting vehicle designed for front-line combat, with heavy firepower, strong armour, and tracks and a powerful engine providing good battlefield maneuverability.  The first tanks were designed to overcome the deadlock of trench warfare; in the 2010s, they are a mainstay of modern ground forces and a key part of combined arms combat.  Modern tanks are versatile mobile land weapon system platforms, mounting a large-calibre cannon in a rotating gun turret, supplemented by mounted machine guns or other weapons.  They combine this with heavy vehicle armour which provides protection for the crew, the vehicle's weapons, and its propulsion systems, and operational mobility, due to its use of tracks rather than wheels, which allows the tank to move over rugged terrain and adverse conditions such as mud, and be positioned on the battlefield in advantageous locations. 

Herbal tea<====>29972<====>Herbal tea Herbal teas — less commonly Google Ngram Viewer  called herb teas or tisanes (UK and US  , US also  ) Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary  — and fruit teas are beverages made from the infusion or decoction of herbs, spices, fruits, or other plant material in hot water.  They do not usually contain caffeine.   Herbal teas and fruit teas should not be confused with true teas (e. g. , black, green, white, yellow, oolong), which are prepared from the cured leaves of the tea plant, Camellia sinensis), nor with decaffeinated tea, in which the caffeine has been removed. 

Turmeric<====>29973<====>Turmeric   Turmeric (Curcuma longa) ( )    is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial plant of the ginger family, Zingiberaceae.   It is native to the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia, and requires temperatures between   and a considerable amount of annual rainfall to thrive.  Plants are gathered annually for their rhizomes and propagated from some of those rhizomes in the following season. When not used fresh, the rhizomes are boiled in water for about 30–45 minutes and then dried in hot ovens, after which they are ground into a deep-orange-yellow powder  commonly used as a coloring and flavoring agent in many Asian cuisines, especially for curries, as well as for dyeing. 

Total war<====>29974<====>Total war   Total war is warfare that includes any and all civilian-associated resources and infrastructure as legitimate military targets, mobilizes all of the resources of society to fight the war, and gives priority to warfare over non-combatant needs.  The American-English Dictionary defines total war as "war that is unrestricted in terms of the weapons used, the territory or combatants involved, or the objectives pursued, especially one in which the laws of war are disregarded. "In the mid-19th century, scholars identified "total war" as a separate class of warfare.  In a total war, to an extent inapplicable in less total conflicts, the differentiation between combatants and non-combatants diminishes and sometimes it even vanishes entirely because opposing sides can consider nearly every human resource, even that of non-combatants, to be a part of the war effort. 

Time constraint<====>29980<====>Time constraint In law, time constraints are placed on certain actions and filings in the interest of speedy justice, and additionally to prevent the evasion of the ends of justice by waiting until a matter is moot.   The penalty for violating a legislative or court-imposed time constraint may be anything from a small fine to judicial determination of an entire case against one's interests. For example, if a complaining party files an action and then fails to cause the papers pertaining thereto to be served on the opposing party within the time established by local rules, and is unable to convince the court that there was good and sufficient reason for the delay, he risks having his action dismissed with prejudice. 

Taurus (constellation)<====>29984<====>Taurus (constellation) Taurus (Latin for "the Bull") is one of the constellations of the zodiac, which means it is crossed by the plane of the ecliptic.  Taurus is a large and prominent constellation in the northern hemisphere's winter sky.  It is one of the oldest constellations, dating back to at least the Early Bronze Age when it marked the location of the Sun during the spring equinox.  Its importance to the agricultural calendar influenced various bull figures in the mythologies of Ancient Sumer, Akkad, Assyria, Babylon, Egypt, Greece, and Rome. A number of features exist that are of interest to astronomers. 

Taco<====>29985<====>Taco    A taco is a traditional Mexican dish composed of a corn or wheat tortilla folded or rolled around a filling.  A taco can be made with a variety of fillings, including beef, pork, chicken, seafood, vegetables, and cheese, allowing for great versatility and variety.  A taco is generally eaten without utensils and is often accompanied by garnishes such as salsa, chili pepper, avocado, guacamole, cilantro (coriander), tomatoes, onions, and lettuce. EtymologyThe origins of the taco are not precisely known, and etymologies for the culinary usage of the word are generally theoretical.According to the Real Academia Española, publisher of Diccionario de la Lengua Española, the word taco describes a typical Mexican dish of a maize tortilla folded around food. 

The Penguins<====>29987<====>The Penguins   The Penguins were an American doo-wop group of the 1950s and early 1960s, best remembered for their only Top 40 hit, "Earth Angel", which was one of the first rhythm and blues hits to cross over to the pop charts.  The song peaked at #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart,  but had a three-week run at  on the R&B chart, later used in the Back to the Future movies.  The group's tenor was Cleveland Duncan.  Early careerThe original members of The Penguins were Cleveland Duncan (July 23, 1935 – November 7, 2012), Curtis Williams (December 11, 1934 – August 10, 1979), Dexter Tisby (March 10, 1935) and Bruce Tate (January 27, 1937 – June 20, 1973). 

Tenochtitlan<====>29988<====>Tenochtitlan  Tenochtitlan ( ,  ), originally known as México-Tenochtitlán ( ), was a large Mexica city-state on an island in Lake Texcoco in the Valley of Mexico.

At its peak, it was the largest city in the Pre-Columbian Americas.  It subsequently became a cabecera of the Viceroyalty of New Spain.   Today, the ruins of Tenochtitlan are in the historic center of Mexico City. Tenochtitlan was one of two Nahua āltēpetl (city-states) on the island, the other being Tlatelolco. 

Triassic<====>29989<====>Triassic The Triassic ( ) is a geologic period and system which spans 50. 9 million years from the end of the Permian Period 251. 902 million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period   Mya .  The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era.  Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events.    The Triassic began in the wake of the Permian–Triassic extinction event, which left the earth's biosphere impoverished; it would take well into the middle of this period for life to recover its former diversity. 

Titanic Thompson<====>29990<====>Titanic Thompson Alvin Clarence Thomas (November 30, 1893 – May 19, 1974) was an American gambler, golfer and hustler better known as Titanic Thompson.

OverviewHe traveled the country wagering at cards, dice games, golf, shooting, billiards, horseshoes and proposition bets of his own devising.As an ambidextrous golfer, card player, marksman and pool shark, his skills and reputation were compared to "Merlin himself".   Writer Damon Runyon allegedly based the character Sky Masterson, the gambler-hero of "The Idyll of Miss Sarah Brown" (on which the musical "Guys and Dolls" is based), on Thompson. 

The Shockwave Rider<====>29991<====>The Shockwave Rider    The Shockwave Rider is a science fiction novel by John Brunner, originally published in 1975.  It is notable for its hero's use of computer hacking skills to escape pursuit in a dystopian future, and for the coining of the word "worm" to describe a program that propagates itself through a computer network. It also introduces the concept of a Delphi pool,  perhaps derived from the RAND Corporation's Delphi method – a futures market on world events which bears close resemblance to DARPA's controversial and cancelled Policy Analysis Market.

Theory of relativity<====>30001<====>Theory of relativity   The theory of relativity usually encompasses two interrelated theories by Albert Einstein: special relativity and general relativity.   Special relativity applies to elementary particles and their interactions, describing all their physical phenomena except gravity.  General relativity explains the law of gravitation and its relation to other forces of nature.   It applies to the cosmological and astrophysical realm, including astronomy.  The theory transformed theoretical physics and astronomy during the 20th century, superseding a 200-year-old theory of mechanics created primarily by Isaac Newton.It introduced concepts including spacetime as a unified entity of space and time, relativity of simultaneity, kinematic and gravitational time dilation, and length contraction. 

Telephone<====>30003<====>TelephoneA telephone, or phone, is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be heard directly.  A telephone converts sound, typically and most efficiently the human voice, into electronic signals that are transmitted via cables and other communication channels to another telephone which reproduces the sound to the receiving user. In 1876, Scottish emigrant Alexander Graham Bell was the first to be granted a United States patent for a device that produced clearly intelligible replication of the human voice.  This instrument was further developed by many others.

Telegraph<====>30009<====>Telegraph

Telegraphy<====>30010<====>Telegraphy   Telegraphy (from Greek: τῆλε  , "at a distance" and γράφειν  , "to write") is the long-distance transmission of textual or symbolic (as opposed to verbal or audio) messages without the physical exchange of an object bearing the message.  Thus semaphore is a method of telegraphy, whereas pigeon post is not. Telegraphy requires that the method used for encoding the message be known to both sender and receiver.  Many methods are designed according to the limits of the signalling medium used.  The use of smoke signals, beacons, reflected light signals, and flag semaphore signals are early examples. 

Transistor<====>30011<====>Transistor  A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electronic signals and electrical power.  It is composed of semiconductor material usually with at least three terminals for connection to an external circuit.  A voltage or current applied to one pair of the transistor's terminals controls the current through another pair of terminals.  Because the controlled (output) power can be higher than the controlling (input) power, a transistor can amplify a signal.  Today, some transistors are packaged individually, but many more are found embedded in integrated circuits. The transistor is the fundamental building block of modern electronic devices, and is ubiquitous in modern electronic systems. 

Time<====>30012<====>TimeTime is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events that occur in apparently irreversible succession from the past through the present to the future.    Time is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience.  Merriam-Webster Dictionary the measured or measurable period during which an action, process, or condition exists or continues : duration; a nonspatial continuum which is measured in terms of events that succeed one another from past through present to future  Compact Oxford English Dictionary A limited stretch or space of continued existence, as the interval between two successive events or acts, or the period through which an action, condition, or state continues.

The film contains excerpts from speeches given by Nazi leaders at the Congress, including Adolf Hitler, Rudolf Hess and Julius Streicher, interspersed with footage of massed Sturmabteilung (SA) and Schutzstaffel (SS) troops and public reaction.  Hitler commissioned the film and served as an unofficial executive producer; his name appears in the opening titles. 

Titanium<====>30040<====>TitaniumTitanium is a chemical element with symbol Ti and atomic number 22.  It is a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density, and high strength.  Titanium is resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua regia, and chlorine. Titanium was discovered in Cornwall, Great Britain, by William Gregor in 1791, and was named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth for the Titans of Greek mythology.  The element occurs within a number of mineral deposits, principally rutile and ilmenite, which are widely distributed in the Earth's crust and lithosphere, and it is found in almost all living things, water bodies, rocks, and soils. 

Technetium<====>30041<====>Technetium  Technetium is a chemical element with symbol Tc and atomic number 43.  It is the lightest element whose isotopes are all radioactive; none are stable.  Nearly all technetium is produced synthetically, and only minute amounts are found in the Earth's crust.  Naturally occurring technetium is a spontaneous fission product in uranium ore or the product of neutron capture in molybdenum ores.  The chemical properties of this silvery gray, crystalline transition metal are intermediate between rhenium and manganese. Many of technetium's properties were predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev before the element was discovered.  Mendeleev noted a gap in his periodic table and gave the undiscovered element the provisional name ekamanganese (Em). 

Tin<====>30042<====>Tin  Tin is a chemical element with symbol Sn (from  ) and atomic number 50.  It is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table.  It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO 2 .  Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4.  Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. 

Tellurium<====>30043<====>Tellurium  Tellurium is a chemical element with symbol Te and atomic number 52.  It is a brittle, mildly toxic, rare, silver-white metalloid.  Tellurium is chemically related to selenium and sulfur.  It is occasionally found in native form as elemental crystals.  Tellurium is far more common in the universe as a whole than on Earth.  Its extreme rarity in the Earth's crust, comparable to that of platinum, is due partly to its high atomic number, but also to its formation of a volatile hydride which caused it to be lost to space as a gas during the hot nebular formation of the planet. 

Thorium<====>30044<====>Thorium    Thorium is a weakly radioactive metallic chemical element with symbol Th and atomic number 90.  Thorium metal is silvery and tarnishes black when it is exposed to air, forming the dioxide; it is moderately hard, malleable, and has a high melting point.  Thorium is an electropositive actinide whose chemistry is dominated by the +4 oxidation state; it is quite reactive and can ignite in air when finely divided. All known thorium isotopes are unstable.  The most stable isotope,  232 Th, has a half-life of 14. 05 billion years, or about the age of the universe; it decays very slowly via alpha decay, starting a decay chain named the thorium series that ends at stable  208 Pb. 

Terbium<====>30045<====>Terbium  Terbium is a chemical element with symbol Tb and atomic number 65.  It is a silvery-white, rare earth metal that is malleable, ductile, and soft enough to be cut with a knife.  The ninth member of the lanthanide series, terbium is a fairly electropositive metal that reacts with water, evolving hydrogen gas.  Terbium is never found in nature as a free element, but it is contained in many minerals, including cerite, gadolinite, monazite, xenotime, and euxenite. Swedish chemist Carl Gustaf Mosander discovered terbium as a separate elemental compound in 1843.  He detected it as an impurity in yttrium oxide, Y 2 O 3 . 

Tungsten<====>30046<====>Tungsten  Tungsten, or wolfram,   is a chemical element with symbol W and atomic number 74.  The name tungsten comes from the former Swedish name for the tungstate mineral scheelite, from tung sten "heavy stone".   Tungsten is a rare metal found naturally on Earth almost exclusively in chemical compounds.  It was identified as a new element in 1781, and first isolated as a metal in 1783.  Its important ores include wolframite and scheelite. The free element is remarkable for its robustness, especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all the elements discovered, melting at 3422 °C (6192 °F, 3695 K). 

Thulium<====>30047<====>Thulium   Thulium is a chemical element with symbol Tm and atomic number 69.  It is the thirteenth and third-last element in the lanthanide series.  Like the other lanthanides, the most common oxidation state is +3, seen in its oxide, halides and other compounds; because it occurs so late in the series, however, the +2 oxidation state is also stabilized by the nearly full 4f shell that results.  In aqueous solution, like compounds of other late lanthanides, soluble thulium compounds form coordination complexes with nine water molecules. In 1879, the Swedish chemist Per Teodor Cleve separated from the rare earth oxide erbia another two previously unknown components, which he called holmia and thulia; these were the oxides of holmium and thulium, respectively. 

Tantalum<====>30048<====>Tantalum Tantalum is a chemical element with symbol Ta and atomic number 73.  Previously known as tantalium, its name comes from Tantalus, a villain from Greek mythology.   Tantalum is a rare, hard, blue-gray, lustrous transition metal that is highly corrosion-resistant.  It is part of the refractory metals group, which are widely used as minor components in alloys.  The chemical inertness of tantalum makes it a valuable substance for laboratory equipment and a substitute for platinum.  Its main use today is in tantalum capacitors in electronic equipment such as mobile phones, DVD players, video game systems and computers. 

Torch<====>30051<====>Torch    A torch is a stick with combustible material at one end, which is ignited and used as a light source.   Torches have been used throughout history, and are still used in processions, symbolic and religious events, and in juggling entertainment.  In some countries, the word "torch" is used as the term for a battery-operated portable light. EtymologyFrom the Old French "torche" meaning "twisted thing," hence "torch formed of twisted tow dipped in wax," probably from Vulgar Latin *torca, alteration of Late Latin torqua, variant of classical Latin torques "collar of twisted metal," from torquere "to twist".

Trojan horse (computing)<====>30056<====>Trojan horse (computing)  In computing, a Trojan horse, or Trojan, is any malicious computer program which misleads users of its true intent.  The term is derived from the Ancient Greek story of the deceptive wooden horse that led to the fall of the city of Troy. Trojans are generally spread by some form of social engineering, for example where a user is duped into executing an e-mail attachment disguised to be unsuspicious, (e. g. , a routine form to be filled in), or by drive-by download.  Although their payload can be anything, many modern forms act as a backdoor, contacting a controller which can then have unauthorized access to the affected computer. 

Tokyo<====>30057<====>TokyoTokyo ( ,  ), officially Tokyo Metropolis,  is the capital city of Japan and one of its 47 prefectures.   The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world.   It is the seat of the Emperor of Japan and the Japanese government.  Tokyo is in the Kantō region on the southeastern side of the main island Honshu and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands.  Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric.  (2005).  "Tōkyō" in  ; "Kantō" in    Formerly known as Edo, it has been the de facto seat of government since 1603 when Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city his headquarters. 

Trojan War<====>30058<====>Trojan War    In Greek mythology, the Trojan War was waged against the city of Troy by the Achaeans (Greeks) after Paris of Troy took Helen from her husband Menelaus, king of Sparta.  The war is one of the most important events in Greek mythology and has been narrated through many works of Greek literature, most notably through Homer's Iliad.  The Iliad relates four days in the tenth year of the decade-long siege of Troy; the Odyssey describes the journey home of Odysseus, one of the war's heroes.  Other parts of the war are described in a cycle of epic poems, which have survived through fragments. 

Troy<====>30059<====>Troy  Troy ( , Troia or Τροίας, Troias and  , Ilion or  , Ilios;   and  ; Trōia is the typical Latin name for the city.  Ilium is a more poetic term:    Hittite: Wilusha or Truwisha; ) was a city situated in the far northwest of the region known in late Classical antiquity as Asia Minor, now known as Anatolia in modern Turkey, near (just south of) the southwest mouth of the Dardanelles strait and northwest of Mount Ida.  The present-day location is known as Hisarlik. 

Tübingen<====>30061<====>Tübingen Tübingen ( ,  ) is a traditional university town in  central Baden-Württemberg, Germany.  It is situated   south of the state capital, Stuttgart, on a ridge between the Neckar and Ammer rivers.about one in three people living in Tübingen is a student. GeographyImmediately north of the city lies the Schönbuch, a densely wooded nature park.  The Swabian Alb mountains rise about   (beeline Tübingen City to Roßberg (869m)) to the southeast of Tübingen. The Ammer and Steinlach rivers discharge into the Neckar river, which flows right through the town, just south of the medieval old town in an easterly direction. 

Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus<====>30062<====>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus The Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (TLP) (Latin for "Logico-Philosophical Treatise") is the only book-length philosophical work published by the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein in his lifetime.  The project had a broad aim to identify the relationship between language and reality and to define the limits of science  and is recognized as a significant philosophical work of the twentieth century.  G.  E.  Moore originally suggested the work's Latin title as homage to the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus by Baruch Spinoza.  Wittgenstein wrote the notes for the Tractatus while he was a soldier during World War I and completed it during a military leave in the summer of 1918. 

TeX<====>30065<====>TeXTeX ( , see below), stylized  within the system as  T e X , is a typesetting system (or "formatting system") designed and mostly written by Donald Knuth  and released in 1978.  Together with the Metafont language for font description and the Computer Modern family of typefaces, TeX was designed with two main goals in mind: to allow anybody to produce high-quality books using minimal effort, and to provide a system that would give exactly the same results on all computers, at any point in time.   TeX is free software, which made it accessible to a wide range of users.

Tradition<====>30067<====>Tradition A tradition is a belief or behavior passed down within a group or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past. Common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes (like lawyers' wigs or military officers' spurs), but the idea has also been applied to social norms such as greetings.  Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of years—the word "tradition" itself derives from the Latin tradere literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping.  While it is commonly assumed that traditions have ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether that be political or cultural, over short periods of time. 

The Boston Globe<====>30068<====>The Boston Globe The Boston Globe (sometimes abbreviated as The Globe) is an American daily newspaper founded and based in Boston, Massachusetts, since its creation by Charles H.  Taylor in 1872.  The newspaper has won a total of 26 Pulitzer Prizes as of 2016, and with a total paid circulation of 245,824 from September 2015 to August 2016,  it is the 25th most read newspaper in the United States.  The Boston Globe is the oldest and largest daily newspaper in Boston.

T<====>30071<====>T    T (named tee   ) is the 20th letter in the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet.  It is the most commonly used consonant and the second most common letter in English language texts.  HistoryPhoenician   Taw Etruscan  T Greek   Tau    Taw was the last letter of the Western Semitic and Hebrew alphabets.   The sound value of Semitic Taw, Greek alphabet Tαυ (Tau), Old Italic and Latin T has remained fairly constant, representing   in each of these; and it has also kept its original basic shape in most of these alphabets. 

Thales of Miletus<====>30072<====>Thales of Miletus  Thales of Miletus ( ;  , Thalēs;   624 – c.  546 BC) was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher, mathematician, and astronomer from Miletus in Asia Minor (present-day Milet in Turkey).   He was one of the Seven Sages of Greece.  Many, most notably Aristotle, regarded him as the first philosopher in the Greek tradition,and he is otherwise historically recognized as the first individual in Western civilization known to have entertained and engaged in scientific philosophy.   Frank N.  Magill, The Ancient World: Dictionary of World Biography, Volume 1, Routledge, 2003   Thales is recognized for breaking from the use of mythology to explain the world and the universe, and instead explaining natural objects and phenomena by theories and hypotheses, i. 

Tiger<====>30075<====>Tiger The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest cat species, most recognizable for their pattern of dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside.  The species is classified in the genus Panthera with the lion, leopard, jaguar, and snow leopard.  Tigers are apex predators, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and bovids.  They are territorial and generally solitary but social animals, often requiring large contiguous areas of habitat that support their prey requirements.  This, coupled with the fact that they are indigenous to some of the more densely populated places on Earth, has caused significant conflicts with humans. 

Talk radio<====>30077<====>Talk radio  Talk radio is a radio format containing discussion about topical issues and consisting entirely or almost entirely of original spoken word content rather than outside music.  Jason Culpepper is highly recognized as the father of talk radio.  Jason, a Jacksonville native, rose to social prominence during the World War utilizing talk radio to warn French and American troops of German U boats.  Most shows are regularly hosted by a single individual, and often feature interviews with a number of different guests.  Talk radio typically includes an element of listener participation, usually by broadcasting live conversations between the host and listeners who "call in" (usually via telephone) to the show. 

Thyroid<====>30078<====>Thyroid  The thyroid gland, or simply the thyroid, is an endocrine gland in the neck, consisting of two lobes connected by an isthmus.  It is found at the front of the neck, below the Adam's apple.  The thyroid gland secretes thyroid hormones, which primarily influence the metabolic rate and protein synthesis.  The hormones also have many other effects including those on development.  The thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T 3 ) and thyroxine (T 4 ) are created from iodine and tyrosine.  The thyroid also produces the hormone calcitonin, which plays a role in calcium homeostasis.

Geography of Taiwan<====>30089<====>Geography of Taiwan    Taiwan, formerly known as Formosa,  is an island in East Asia; located some   off the southeastern coast of mainland China across the Taiwan Strait.  It has an area of   and spans the Tropic of Cancer.  The East China Sea lies to the north, the Philippine Sea to the east, the Luzon Strait directly to the south and the South China Sea to the southwest.  Taiwan proper makes up 99% of the territory of the Free Area controlled by the Republic of China since the ROC lost its mainland China territory in the Chinese Civil War and fled to the island in 1949; the ROC itself is commonly referred to as simply "Taiwan". 

Politics of the Republic of China<====>30091<====>Politics of the Republic of China    The politics of the Republic of China take place in a framework of a representative democratic republic, whereby the President is head of state and the Premier (Chef of the Executive Yuan) is head of government, and of a multi-party system.  Executive power is exercised by the government.  Legislative power is vested in primarily with the parliament and limited by government.  The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.  The party system is dominated by the Kuomintang (KMT, "Chinese Nationalist Party"), which favours closer links to mainland China, and the Democratic Progressive Party, which favors Taiwanese independence. 

Economy of Taiwan<====>30092<====>Economy of TaiwanThe economy of the Republic of China (Taiwan), simply called Taiwan, is the 7th largest economy in Asia, and is included in the advanced economies group   by the International Monetary Fund and gauged in the high-income economies group by the World Bank,  and ranked 15th   in the world by the Global Competitiveness Report of World Economic Forum, has a developed capitalist economy that ranks as the 22nd-largest in the world by purchasing power parity (PPP), ranks as 18th in the world by gross domestic product (GDP) at purchasing power parity per capita (person), and 24th in nominal GDP of investment and foreign trade by the Republic of China (ROC) government, commonly referred to as Taiwan. The economy of Taiwan ranks the highest in Asia for 2015 Global Entrepreneurship Index (GEI) for specific strengths.  Most large government-owned banks and industrial firms have been privatized.  With the technocracy-centered economic planning   under martial law until 1987, real growth in GDP has averaged about 8% during the past three decades. Exports have grown even faster and since World War II, have provided the primary impetus for industrialization. Inflation and unemployment are low; the trade surplus is substantial; and foreign reserves are the world's fourth largest. Agriculture contributes 3% to GDP, down from 35% in 1952, and the service sector makes up 73% of the economy. Traditional labor-intensive industries are steadily being moved off-shore and replaced with more capital- and technology-intensive industries. Economy of Taiwan is an indispensable partner in the Global Value Chains of Electronics Industry.  Electronic components and personal computer are two areas of international strength of Taiwan's Information Technology industry,  which means the economy of Taiwan has the competitive edge on having the learning curve from advanced foreign technologies with lower cost to be produced and sold abroad. Institute for Information Industry    with its international recognitions   is responsible for the development of IT industry and ICT industry   in Taiwan. Industrial Technology Research Institute   with its global partners   is the advanced research center for applied technology for the economy of Taiwan. Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics   and Ministry of Economic Affairs   release major economic indicators of the economy of Taiwan. Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research provides economic forecast at the forefront for the economy of Taiwan   and authoritatively researches on the bilateral economic relations with ASEAN by The Taiwan ASEAN Studies Center (TASC).   Taiwan Stock Exchange is the host to the listed companies of local industries in Taiwan with weighted financial exposures to the FTSE Taiwan Index and MSCI Taiwan Index.International Trade is officially assisted by Taiwan External Trade Development Council.  Taiwanese investors and businesses have become major investors in mainland China, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia. Because of the conservative and stable financial policy   by the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the entrepreneurial strengths,  Taiwan suffered little from the financial crisis of 1997-1999 compared to many economies in the region. Other two major banks in Taiwan are Bank of Taiwan and Mega International Commercial Bank. Unlike the neighboring Japan and South Korea, small and medium-sized businesses make up a significant proportion of the businesses in Taiwan. Taiwan is characterized as one of the Newly industrialized economy in the wake of the Ten Major Construction Projects since 1970's. Since 1990's, the economy of Taiwan has adopted economic liberalization with the successive regulatory reforms.  London Metal Exchange, the largest metal stock exchange in the world, approved Kaohsiung, Taiwan as a good delivery point for primary aluminium, aluminium alloy, copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc and as the LME’s ninth location in Asia on 17 June 2013, for future contracts on metals and industrial production of the global integration of the economy of Taiwan.  The economy of Taiwan has the world's highest modern convenience store concentration density.  The Indirect tax system of the economy of Taiwan comprises Gross Business Receipts Tax (GBRT) (Gross receipts tax) and Value-added tax.  The economy of Taiwan is ranked 15th overall in the Global Top 20 Top Destination Cities by International Overnight Visitors (2014) by the MasterCard 2014 Global Destination Cities Index.  Bubble Tea originated in Taiwan.   Taiwan is a member of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). Taiwan is also an observer   at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) under the name of "Chinese Taipei",  and a member of International Chamber of Commerce as "Chinese Taipei".  Taiwan signed Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement with People's Republic of China on 29 June 2010. Taiwan also signed free trade pact with Singapore and New Zealand.   Taiwan is seeking to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership no later than 2020 if economic requirements are met.    The economy of Taiwan also applied for the membership in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in 2015.  Taiwan's top five trade partners in 2010 are China, Japan, USA, the European Union, and Hong Kong. The economy of Taiwan, compared with other major economies in the region, is "at a crossroads",  and facing economic marginalization in the world economy,    in addition to de-internationalization, low-paid salary to employees and uncertain outlook for personal promotion of staff, which results in human resource talents seeking career opportunities elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, and businesses in Taiwan suffer most from being the size of small and medium enterprises only with weaker-than-expected revenue of its hectic business operation for any consideration of further expansion, and overall impedes any attempts at economic transformation of Taiwan from the Taiwanese government.  The World Trade Organization has also reviewed Chinese Taipei's economic outlook in 2010.  The international industrial forecast of semiconductor manufacturing, which is the flagship industry of the economy of Taiwan, that faces immense competition ahead with its American counterparts.   To conclude, facing the Market failure from Externality, the Taiwan government needs well-thought industrial policy    urgently to adapt to the new economic landscape, and as an island economy with lack of natural resources and comparatively lower domestic aggregate demand, Taiwan's highly educated human resources   would contribute greatly to Value added Innovation management for expanding Taiwan's international trade.History  Taiwan has transformed itself from a recipient of U.S. aid in the 1950s and early 1960s to an aid donor and major foreign investor, with investments primarily centered in Asia. Private Taiwanese investment in mainland China is estimated to total in excess of US$150 billion,  and official tallies cite Taiwan as having invested a comparable amount in Southeast Asia.Taiwan has historically benefited from the flight of many well-educated, wealthy Chinese to settle on the island: during early Qing Dynasty, the preceding Ming dynasty supporters survived for a brief period of time in exile in Taiwan, and in 1949, as the Chinese Communist Party gained control of mainland China, two million Kuomintang (KMT) supporters fled to the island.The first step towards industrialization was land reforms, a crucial step in modernizing the economy, as it created a class of landowners with capital they can invest in future economic endeavors. US aid was also important to stabilize post-war Taiwan, and it constituted more than 30 percent of domestic investment from 1951 to 1962. These factors, together with government planning and universal education, brought huge advancement in industry and agriculture, and living standards. The economy shifted from an agriculture-based economy (32% of GDP in 1952) to an industry-oriented economy (47% of GDP in 1986).    Between 1952 and 1961, the economy grew by an average of 9.21% each year. Once again, the transformation of Taiwan's economy cannot be understood without reference to the larger geopolitical framework. Although aid was cut back in the 1970s, it was crucial in the formative years, spurring industrialization and security and economic links were maintained. Uncertainty about the US commitment accelerated the country’s shift from subsidized import-substitution in the 1950s to export-led growth. Development of foreign trade and exports helped absorb excess labor from the decreased importance of agriculture in the economy.  Like Korea, Taiwan moved from cheap, labor-intensive manufactures, such as textiles and toys, into an expansion of heavy industry and infrastructure in the 1970s, and then to advanced electronics in the subsequent decade. By the 1980s, the economy was becoming increasingly open and the government moved towards privatization of government enterprises.  Technological development led to the establishment of the Hsinchu Science Park in 1981. Investments in mainland China spurred cross-strait trade, decreasing Taiwan's dependence on the United States market.  From 1981–1995, the economy grew at an annual rate of 7.52%, and the service sector became the largest sector at 51.67%, surpassing the industrial sector and becoming a major source of the economy's growth.GDP per capita for administrative divisions in Republic of China in 2016List of cities and counties in Republic of China (Taiwan) by GDP per capita in 2016 According [1] (IMF-WEO April 2017), PPP rate is NTD 15.11 per Int'l.dollar; according [2], the average exchange rate is NTD 32.258135 per US dollar (the average exchange rate of the year was 32.258135 NTD to 1 USD); GDP per capita figures in USD are retrieved from https://tieba.baidu.com/p/5313891806?pn=0& and are published by National Statistics of Republic of China (Taiwan)[3].

With the prospect of continued relocation of labor-intensive industries to economies with cheaper work forces, such as in mainland China and Vietnam, Taiwan's future development will have to rely on further transformation to a high technology and service-oriented economy.    In recent years, Taiwan has successfully diversified its trade markets, cutting its share of exports to the United States from 49% in 1984 to 20% in 2002. Taiwan's dependence on the United States should continue to decrease as its exports to Southeast Asia and mainland China grow and its efforts to develop European markets produce results.    Taiwan's accession to the WTO and its desire to become an Asia-Pacific "regional operations center" are spurring further economic liberalization.Global financial crisisTaiwan has recovered quickly from the global financial crisis of 2007–2010, and its economy has been growing steadily. Its economy faced a downturn in 2009 due to a heavy reliance on exports which in turn made it vulnerable to world markets.  Unemployment reached levels not seen since 2003, and the economy fell 8.36% in the fourth quarter of 2008.  In response, the government launched a US$5.6 billion economic stimulus package (3% of its GDP), provided financial incentives for businesses, and introduced tax breaks.  The stimulus package focused on infrastructure development, small and medium-sized businesses, tax breaks for new investments, and low-income households.  Boosting shipments to new overseas markets, such as Russia, Brazil, and the Middle East was also a main goal of the stimulus.  The economy has since slowly recovered; by November 2010, Taiwan's unemployment rate had fallen to a two-year low of 4.73%,  and continued dropping to a 40-month low of 4.18% by the end of 2011.  The average salary has also been rising steadily for each month in 2010, up 1.92% from the same period in 2009.  Industrial output for November 2010 reached another high, up 19.37% from a year earlier, indicating strong exports and a growing local economy.  Private consumption is also increasing, with retail sales up 6.4% compared to 2009.  After 10.5% economic growth in 2010, the World Bank expected growth to continue and reach 5% for 2011. Foreign tradeForeign trade has been the engine of Taiwan's rapid growth during the past 40 years. Taiwan's economy remains export-oriented, thus it depends on an open world trade regime and remains vulnerable to downturns in the world economy. The total value of trade increased over fivefold in the 1960s, nearly tenfold in the 1970s, and doubled again in the 1980s.  The 1990s saw a more modest, slightly less than twofold, growth. Export composition changed from predominantly agricultural commodities to industrial goods (now 98%). The electronics sector is Taiwan's most important industrial export sector and is the largest recipient of United States investment.Taiwan, as an independent economy, became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) as Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu (often shortened to "Chinese Taipei"-both names resulting from PRC interference on the WTO) in January 2002. In a 2011 report by Business Environment Risk Intelligence (BERI), Taiwan ranked third-best globally for its investment environment. Taiwan is the world's largest supplier of contract computer chip manufacturing (foundry services) and is a leading LCD panel manufacturer,  DRAM computer memory, networking equipment, and consumer electronics designer and manufacturer.  Major hardware companies include Acer, Asus, HTC, Foxconn, TSMC and Pegatron. Textiles are another major industrial export sector, though of declining importance due to labor shortages, increasing overhead costs, land prices, and environmental protection.   Imports are dominated by raw materials and capital goods, which account for more than 90% of the total. Taiwan imports most of its energy needs. The United States is Taiwan's third largest trading partner, taking 11.4% of Taiwanese exports and supplying 10.0% of its imports.   Mainland China has recently become Taiwan's largest import and export partner. In 2010, the mainland accounted for 28.0% of Taiwan's exports and 13.2% of imports.   This figure is growing rapidly as both economies become ever more interdependent. Imports from  mainland China consist mostly of agricultural and industrial raw materials. Exports to the United States are mainly electronics and consumer goods. As Taiwanese per capita income level has risen, demand for imported, high-quality consumer goods has increased. Taiwan's 2002 trade surplus with the United States was $8.70 billion.The lack of formal diplomatic relations between the Republic of China (Taiwan) with Taiwan's trading partners appears not to have seriously hindered Taiwan's rapidly expanding commerce. The Republic of China maintains cultural and trade offices in more than 60 countries with which it does not have official relations to represent Taiwanese interest. In addition to the WTO, Taiwan is a member of the Asian Development Bank as "Taipei, China" (a name resulting from PRC influence on the bank) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum as "Chinese Taipei" (for the same reason as above). These developments reflect Taiwan's economic importance and its desire to become further integrated into the global economy.The Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) with the People's Republic of China was signed on 29 June 2010, in Chongqing.It could potentially widen the market for Taiwan's exports. However, the true benefits and impacts brought by ECFA to Taiwan's overall economy are still in dispute.  The newly signed agreement will allow for more than 500 products made in Taiwan to enter mainland China at low or no tariffs.  The government is also looking to establish trade agreements with Singapore  and the United States. IndustryIndustrial output has gradually decreased from accounting for over half of Taiwan's GDP in 1986 to just 31% in 2002.  Industries have gradually moved to capital and technology-intensive industries from more labor-intensive industries, with electronics and information technology accounting for 35% of the industrial structure.  Industry in Taiwan primarily consists of many small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) with fewer large enterprises.Taiwan's information technology industry has played an important role in the worldwide IT market over the last 20 years.  In 1960, the electronics industry in Taiwan was virtually nonexistent.  However, with the government's focus on development of expertise with high technology, along with marketing and management knowledge to establish its own industries, companies such as TSMC and UMC were established.  The industry used its industrial resources and product management experience to cooperate closely with major international suppliers to become the research and development hub of the Asia-Pacific region.  The structure of the industry in Taiwan includes a handful of companies at the top along with many small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) which account for 85% of industrial output.  These SMEs usually produce products on an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or original design manufacturer (ODM) basis, resulting in less resources spent on research and development.  Due to the emphasis of the OEM/ODM model, companies are usually unable to make in-depth assessments for investment, production, and marketing of new products, instead relying upon importation of key components and advanced technology from the United States and Japan.  Twenty of the top information and communication technology (ICT) companies have International Procurement Offices set up in Taiwan.  As a signer of the Information Technology Agreement,  Taiwan phased out tariffs on IT products since 1 January 2002.   The "e-Taiwan" project launched by the government seeks to use US$1.83 billion to improve the information and communications infrastructure in Taiwan in five major areas: government, life, business, transport, and broadband.The program seeks to raise industry competitiveness, improve government efficiency, and improve the quality of life, and aims to increase the number of broadband users on the island to 6 million.  In 2010, Taiwan's software market grew by 7.1% to reach a value of US$4 billion, accounting for 3.3% of the Asia-Pacific region market value. The digital content production industry grew by 15% in 2009, reaching US$14.03 billion.  The optoelectronics industry (including flat panel displays and photovoltaics) totaled NT$2.2 trillion in 2010, a 40% jump from 2009, representing a fifth of the global market share. The semiconductor industry, including IC manufacturing, design, and packing, forms a major part of Taiwan's IT industry.    Due to its strong capabilities in OEM wafer manufacturing and a complete industry supply chain, Taiwan has been able to distinguish itself from its competitors.   The sector output reached US$39 billion in 2009, ranking first in global market share in IC manufacturing, packaging, and testing, and second in IC design.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) are the two largest  contract chipmakers in the world,  while MediaTek is the fourth-largest fabless supplier globally.  In 1987, TSMC pioneered the fabless foundry model, reshaping the global semiconductor industry.   From ITRI's first 3-inch wafer fabrication plant built in 1977    and the founding of UMC in 1980,  the industry has developed into a world leader with 40 fabs in operation by 2002.  In 2007, the semiconductor industry overtook that of the United States, second only to Japan.  Although the global financial crisis from 2007 to 2010 affected sales and exports,  the industry has rebounded with companies posting record profits for 2010.   Taiwan has the largest share of 300 nm, 90 nm, and 60 nm manufacturing capacities worldwide, and was expected to pass Japan in total IC fab capacity by mid-2011.  Information technologyTaiwan has a growing Startup sector.  Agriculture Agriculture has served as a strong foundation for Taiwan's economic miracle.  After retrocession from Japan in 1945, the government announced a long-term strategy of "developing industry through agriculture, and developing agriculture through industry".    As such, agriculture became the foundation for Taiwan's economic development during early years and served as an anchor for growth in industry and commerce. Where as in 1951 agricultural production accounted for 35.8% of Taiwan's GDP,  by 2013 it had been vastly surpassed and its NT$475.90 billion accounted for only 1.69% of the GDP.  , Taiwan's agriculture was a mixture of crops (47.88%), livestock (31.16%), fishery (20.87%) and forestry (0.09%).  Since its accession into the World Trade Organization and the subsequent trade liberalization, the government has implemented new policies to develop the sector into a more competitive and modernized green industry.   Although only about one-quarter of Taiwan's land area is suitable for farming, virtually all farmland is intensely cultivated, with some areas suitable for two and even three crops a year. However, increases in agricultural production have been much slower than industrial growth. Agricultural modernization has been inhibited by the small size of farms and the lack of investment in better facilities and training to develop more profitable businesses.  Taiwan's agricultural population has steadily decreased from 1974 to 2002, prompting the Council of Agriculture to introduce modern farm management, provide technical training, and offer counseling for better production and distribution systems.  Promotion of farm mechanization has helped to alleviate labor shortages while increasing productivity; both rice and sugar cane production are completely mechanized.  Taiwan's main crops are rice, sugar cane, fruits (many of them tropical), and vegetables. Although self-sufficient in rice production, Taiwan imports large amounts of wheat, mostly from the United States. Meat production and consumption has risen sharply, reflecting a high standard of living. Taiwan has exported large amounts of frozen pork, although this was affected by an outbreak of hoof and mouth disease in 1997. Other agricultural exports include fish, aquaculture and sea products, canned and frozen vegetables, and grain products. Imports of agriculture products are expected to increase due to the WTO accession, which is opening previously protected agricultural markets.Energy Due to the lack of natural resources on the island, Taiwan is forced to import many of its energy needs (currently at 98%).  Imported energy totaled US$11.52 billion in 2002, accounting for 4.1% of its GDP.    Although the industrial sector has traditionally been Taiwan's largest energy consumer, its share has dropped in recent years from 62% in 1986 to 58% in 2002.  Taiwan's energy consumption is dominated by crude oil & petroleum products (48.52%), followed by coal (29.2%), natural gas (12.23%), nuclear power (8.33%), and hydroelectric power (0.28%).  The island is also heavily dependent on imported oil, with 72% of its crude oil coming from the Middle East in 2002. Although the Taiwan Power Company (Taipower), state-owned enterprise, is in charge of providing electricity for the Taiwan area, a 1994 measure has allowed independent power producers (IPPs) to provide up to 20% of the island's energy needs.    Indonesia and Malaysia supply most of Taiwan's natural gas needs.  It currently has three operational nuclear power plants. A fourth plant under construction was mothballed in 2014. Although Taiwan's per capita energy use is on par with neighboring Asian countries,  in July 2005 the Ministry of Economic Affairs announced plans to cut 170 million-tons of carbon dioxide emissions by 2025.  In 2010, carbon dioxide emissions have been reduced by 5.14 million metric tons.    In order to further reduce emissions, the government also plans to increase energy efficiency by 2% each year through 2020.  In addition, by 2015 emissions are planned to be reduced by 7% compared to 2005 levels. Taiwan is the world's 4th largest producer of solar-powered batteries and largest LED manufacturer by volume.  In 2010, Taiwan had over 1.66 million square meters of solar heat collectors installed, with an installation density that ranks it as third in the world.  The government has already built 155 sets of wind turbines capable of producing 281.6 MW of energy, and additional projects are planned or under construction.  Renewable energy accounts for 6.8% of Taiwan's energy usage as of 2010.  In 2010, the green energy sector generated US$10.97 billion in production value.  The government also announced plans to invest US$838 million for renewable energy promotion and an additional US$635 million for research and development.   Labor PolicyUnion PoliciesThe Labor Union Laws, legislated by the Kuomintang (KMT) on the mainland, gave Taiwan workers the right to unionize. However, prior to the democratization of Taiwan, the functions of unions were limited under strict regulation and state corporatism.    Under the Labor Union Laws, workers were only allowed to be organized at the companies, which means industry level unions were forbidden. Also, only one union can exist within each company or geographical area.  Special occupational groups such as teachers were not allowed to unionize.    The right to strike and collective bargaining were also hamstrung by law.    The Collective Bargaining Agreement in 1930 stipulated that collective bargains were not legally valid without government approval.  The democratization in 1986 brought dramatic changes to union participation and policies. Between 1986 and 1992, unionized workers increased by 13%.  A number of autonomous, non-official trade unions emerged, including the Taiwan Confederation of Trade Unions (TCTU) which acquired legal recognition in 2000.  The amendments to the Labor Union Laws and Collective Bargaining Agreement both became effective in the early 21st century. The amended Labor Union Law lifted the limitations on special occupational groups from collective representation.  The Collective Bargaining Agreement Act in 2008 guaranteed trade unions the power to negotiate with employers. Employment ProtectionTaiwan's labor rights and employment protections increased with its democratization progress in the 1980s, and it still has relatively high level of employment protection comparing to other East Asia countries.  Implemented in August 1984, Labor Standards Law was the first comprehensive employment protection law for Taiwan workers.    Prior to the its implementation, the Factory Act was the primary law governing labor affairs, but was ineffective in practice because of its narrow coverage of businesses and issues and absence of penalties for violation.  In contrast, Labor Standards Law covered a broader range of businesses and labor affairs, and detailed penalties for its violation. It regulated a period of notice before firing employees, and also required a higher level of severance payment.  Other labor issues were also regulated by the law, including contract, wage, overtime payment, compensations for occupational accidents, etc.    Penalties for employer violation were also clear in the law, stating fines and criminal liabilities.  Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) was set up on 1 August 1987 to help with labor inspection and the enforcement of the Labor Standards Law. Active Labor Market PoliciesActive labor market policies were carried out in Taiwan in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, as a result of economic structural changes caused by globalization and deindustrialization.    Unemployment increased and reached approximately 5% in 2002 and 2009.  A set of policies were adopted to help the unemployed and provide jobs. The Employment Insurance Act in 2002 grants income security during unemployment, but at the same time requires beneficiaries to use all available resources to find jobs.  The Multi-Faceted Job Creation Program, first introduced in 1999, creates job in the third sector groups, especially in nonprofit organizations.  It subsidizes those companies to provide vocational trainings and job opportunities. Fen-ling Chen. "Unemployment and the Government's Role in a Risk Society: A Case Study in Taiwan". Risk and Public Policy in East Asia, edited by Raymond K.H. Chan et. al, 2010, 115-131.  The Public Sector Temporary Employment Creation Program directly addressed the 2008 financial crisis. Unlike the Multi-Faceted Job Creation Programs, the Public Sector Temporary Employment Creation Program creates jobs in the government itself. From 2008 to 2009, the government was estimated to create 102,000 job opportunities by that program.  A job creation project was also implemented to help young people by subsidizing the hiring of young people in universities and private companies. Science and industrial parksIn order to promote industrial research and development, the government began establishing science parks, economic zones which provide rent and utility breaks, tax incentives and specialized lending rates to attract investment.  The first of these, the Hsinchu Science Park was established in 1980 by the National Science Council  with a focus on research and development in information technology and biotechnology.It has been called Taiwan's "Silicon Valley"   and has expanded to six campuses covering an area of  .    Over 430 companies (including many listed on TAIEX) employing over 130,000 people are located within the park, and paid in capital totaled US$36.10 billion in 2008.  Both Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and United Microelectronics Corporation, the world's largest and second largest contract chipmakers,    are headquartered within the park. Since 1980, the government has invested over US$1 billion in the park's infrastructure,    and further expansion for more specialized parks have been pursued.    The Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), headquartered within the park, is the largest nonprofit research organization in Taiwan and has worked to develop applied technological research for industry, including for many of Taiwan's traditional industries (such as textiles). Following the success of the first park, the Southern Taiwan Science Park (STSP), consisting of the Tainan Science Park and the Kaohsiung Science Park, was established in 1996.  In addition to companies, several research institutes (including Academia Sinica) and universities have set up branches within the park with a focus on integrated circuits (ICs), optoelectronics, and biotechnology.   The Central Taiwan Science Park (CTSP) was established more recently in 2003.    While the CTSP is still under development, many firms (including AU Optronics) have already moved into the park and begun manufacturing operations.  Like the other parks, CTSP also focuses on ICs, optoelectronics, and biotechnology, with the optoelectronics industry accounting for 78% of its revenue in 2008.  These three science parks alone have attracted over NT$4 trillion (US$137 billion) worth of capital inflow,  and in 2010 total revenue within the parks reached NT$2.16 trillion (US$72.8 billion). The Linhai Industrial Park, established in Kaohsiung in 1960,  is a well-developed industrial zone with over 490 companies focusing on other industries including base metals, machinery and repairs, nonmetallic mineral products, chemical products, and food and beverage manufacturing.  The Changhua Coastal Industrial Park, located in Changhua County, is a newer industrial cluster with many different industries such as food production, glass, textiles, and plastics.

Republic of China Armed Forces<====>30095<====>Republic of China Armed Forces    The Republic of China Armed Forces are the armed forces of the Republic of China now on Taiwan, encompassing the Army, Navy (including the Republic of China Marine Corps), Air Force and Military Police Force.  It is a military establishment, which accounted for 16. 8% of the central budget in the fiscal year of 2003.  Since 2002, the military comes under the full civilian control of the Ministry of National Defense and oversight by the Legislative Yuan.  It was the National Revolutionary Army before being renamed as the Republic of China Armed Forces in 1947 due to the implementation of the newly promulgated Constitution of the Republic of China (ROC). 

Foreign relations of Taiwan<====>30096<====>Foreign relations of TaiwanThe foreign relations of the Republic of China (ROC), known informally and referred to by many states as Taiwan,are the relations between the Republic of China and other countries.  The Republic of China is recognized by   out of 193 United Nations member states, as well as the Holy See.   These diplomatic relations do not constitute an acceptance by these nations of Taiwan as a state but rather represent a recognition of the ROC government as the representative of all of China, including the Chinese mainland.

Problem of evil<====>30104<====>Problem of evil    The problem of evil refers to the question of how to reconcile the existence of evil with an omnibenevolent, omniscient, and omnipotent  God (see theism).  The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "The Problem of Evil", Michael Tooley  The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "The Evidential Problem of Evil", Nick Trakakis  An argument from evil attempts to show that the co-existence of evil and such a God is unlikely or impossible.  Attempts to show the contrary have traditionally been discussed under the heading of theodicy.  Besides philosophy of religion, the problem of evil is also important to the field of theology and ethics. 

Theodicy<====>30106<====>Theodicy   Theodicy ( ), in its most common form, is an attempt to answer the question of why a good God permits the manifestation of evil.  Some theodicies also address the evidential problem of evil by attempting "to make the existence of an all-knowing, all-powerful and all-good or omnibenevolent God consistent with the existence of evil" or suffering in the world.    Unlike a defense, which tries to demonstrate that God's existence is logically possible in the light of evil, a theodicy attempts to provide a framework wherein God's existence is also plausible.   The German mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Leibniz coined the term "theodicy" in 1710 in his work Théodicée, though various responses to the problem of evil had been previously proposed. 

Tajikistan<====>30108<====>Tajikistan Tajikistan ( ,  , or  ;    ), officially the Republic of Tajikistan ( ), is a mountainous, landlocked country in Central Asia with an estimated population of Expression error: Unrecognised punctuation character: "{" million people as of  , and an area of  .  It is bordered by Afghanistan to the south,  Uzbekistan to the west,  Kyrgyzstan to the north, and  China to the east.  Traditional homelands of Tajik people included present-day Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. The territory that now constitutes Tajikistan was previously home to several ancient cultures, including the city of Sarazm  of the Neolithic and the Bronze Age, and was later home to kingdoms ruled by people of different faiths and cultures, including the Oxus civilisation, Andronovo culture, Buddhism, Nestorian Christianity, Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism and Islam. 

History of Tajikistan<====>30109<====>History of Tajikistan Tajikistan harkens to the Samanid Empire (875–999).  The Tajik people came under Russian rule in the 1860s.  The Basmachi revolt broke out in the wake of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and was quelled in the early 1920s during the Russian Civil War.  In 1924 Tajikistan became an Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics of the Soviet Union, the Tajik ASSR, within Uzbekistan.  In 1929 Tajikistan was made one of the component republics of the Soviet Union – Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic (Tajik SSR) – and it kept that status until gaining independence 1991 after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. 

Geography of Tajikistan<====>30110<====>Geography of TajikistanTajikistan is nestled between Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan to the north and west, China to the east, and Afghanistan to the south.   Mountains cover 93 percent of Tajikistan's surface area.  The two principal ranges, the Pamir Mountains and the Alay Mountains, give rise to many glacier-fed streams and rivers, which have been used to irrigate farmlands since ancient times.  Central Asia's other major mountain range, the Tian Shan, skirts northern Tajikistan.  Mountainous terrain separates Tajikistan's two population centers, which are in the lowlands of the southern ( Panj River ) and northern ( Fergana Valley ) sections of the country. 

Demographics of Tajikistan<====>30111<====>Demographics of TajikistanThe Demographics of Tajikistan is about the demographic features of the population of Tajikistan, including population growth, population density, ethnicity, education level, health, economic status, religious affiliations, and other aspects of the population. Demographic trendsTajikistan's main ethnic group are the Tajiks Persians, with minorities such as the Uzbeks and Kyrgyz, and a small Russian minority.  Because not everyone in Tajikistan is an ethnic Tajik, the non-Tajik citizens of the country are referred to as Tajikistani.  The official nationality of any person from Tajikistan is a Tajikistani, while the ethnic Tajik majority simply call themselves Tajik. Contemporary Tajiks are an Iranian people and ethnic Persians. 

Politics of Tajikistan<====>30112<====>Politics of Tajikistan  The politics of Tajikistan takes place in a framework of a presidential republic, whereby the President is both head of state and head of government, and of a  multi-party system.  Legislative power is vested in both the executive branch and the two chambers of parliament. Political backgroundThe August 1991 putsch widened the rift.  Frustrated by daily demonstrations in front of the Supreme Soviet and the erosion of the government's authority, the regime appeared to support the Moscow putschists.  Kadriddin Aslonov, then the chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Tajikistan, went on record in defence of the (Soviet) status quo when complaining to a journalist of Izvestia that the country is falling into chaos.

With foreign revenue precariously dependent upon exports of cotton and aluminium, the economy is highly vulnerable to external shocks.  Tajikistan's economy also incorporates a massive black market, primarily focused on the drug trade with Afghanistan, and heroin trafficking in Tajikistan is estimated to be equivalent 30-50% of national GDP as of 2012.

Telecommunications in Tajikistan<====>30114<====>Telecommunications in Tajikistan The spread of telecommunications services in Tajikistan telephony, radio, television and internet has not been as extensive as in many other countries.   TelephoneThe conventional telephone system is in poor condition because it has received little investment in the post-Soviet era.  As of 2007 there were 340,000 telephone lines in use, a ratio of one per 21 people.  Many towns are not connected to the national network.  In the early 2000s, the state telecommunications agency, Tajiktelekom, received international aid to upgrade the telephone system.

In 2013, Tajikistan, like many of the other Central Asian countries, was experiencing major development in its transportation sector.  Beginning in 2005, a series of major transportation projects were begun.  The first such project, the Anzob Tunnel, was inaugurated in 2006, providing a year-round road link from Dushanbe to northern Tajikistan. AirportsIn 2009 Tajikistan had 26 airports,  18 of which had paved runways, of which two had runways longer than 3,000 meters.

Tracking shot<====>30247<====>Tracking shot A tracking shot is any shot where the camera moves alongside the object(s) it is recording.  In cinematography, the term refers to a shot in which the camera is mounted on a camera dolly that is then placed on rails – like a railroad track.  The camera is then pushed along the track while the image is being filmed.  A tracking shot generally runs lateral to or alongside its subject since the tracks would be visible in a shot of any distance that moved toward or away from its subject (a maneuver which is formally called a dolly shot and which is usually performed on a freestanding dolly that is not rolled along tracks). 

Theory of justification<====>30248<====>Theory of justification  Theory of justification is a part of epistemology that attempts to understand the justification of propositions and beliefs.  Epistemologists are concerned with various epistemic features of belief, which include the ideas of justification, warrant, rationality, and probability.  Loosely speaking, justification is the reason that someone (properly) holds a belief. When a claim is in doubt, justification can be used to support the claim and reduce or remove the doubt.  Justification can use empiricism (the evidence of the senses), authoritative testimony (the appeal to criteria and authority), or logical deduction. SubjectsJustification focuses on beliefs. 

Regress argument<====>30249<====>Regress argument The regress argument (also known as the diallelus Nicholas Rescher,    (Latin) or diallelon, from Greek di allelon "through or by means of one another")) is a problem in epistemology and, in general, a problem in any situation where a statement has to be justified.According to this argument, any proposition requires a justification.   However, any justification itself requires support.   This means that any proposition whatsoever can be endlessly (infinitely) questioned. OriginThe argument is usually attributed to Sextus Empiricus, and has been restated by Agrippa as part of what has become known as "Agrippa's trilemma". 

Justification for the state<====>30252<====>Justification for the state The justification of the state refers to the source of legitimate authority for the state or government.  Typically, such a justification explains why the state should exist, and to some degree scopes the role of government - what a legitimate state should or should not be able to do. There is no single, universally accepted justification of the state.  In fact, anarchists believe that there is no justification for the state at all, and that human societies would be better off without it.  However, most political ideologies have their own justifications, and thus their own vision of what constitutes a legitimate state. 

Tertiary<====>30253<====>Tertiary    Tertiary is the former term for the geologic period from 65 million to 2. 58 million years ago, a timespan that occurs between the superseded Secondary period and the Quaternary.  The Tertiary is no longer recognized as a formal unit by the International Commission on Stratigraphy,  but the word is still widely used.  The traditional span of the Tertiary has been divided between the Paleogene and Neogene periods and extends to the first stage of the Pleistocene Epoch, the Gelasian stage.   The period began with the demise of the non-avian dinosaurs in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, at the start of the Cenozoic Era, and extended to the beginning of the Quaternary glaciation at the end of the Pliocene Epoch.

Problem of other minds<====>30263<====>Problem of other minds  The problem of other minds is a philosophical problem traditionally stated as the following epistemological challenge raised by the skeptic: given that I can only observe the behavior of others, how can I know that others have minds?   It is a central tenet of the philosophical idea known as solipsism; the notion that for any person only one's own mind is known to exist.  Solipsism maintains that no matter how sophisticated someone's behavior is, behavior on its own does not guarantee the presence of mentality. Philosophical zombiesIt remains possible, for example, that other people are actually nothing more than automata made out of flesh, referred to by philosophers as philosophical zombies.

In these games, Heaven is the top rank of the civilian suit, while Nine is the top rank of the military suit.  The civilian suit was originally called the Chinese (華) suit while the military was called the Barbarian (夷) suit (see Hua–Yi distinction) but this was changed during the Qing dynasty to avoid offending the ruling Manchus.The highly idiosyncratic and culture-specific suit-system of these games are likely the conceptual origin of suits found in playing cards.

Statistical hypothesis testing<====>30284<====>Statistical hypothesis testing  A statistical hypothesis, sometimes called confirmatory data analysis, is a hypothesis that is testable on the basis of observing a process that is modeled via a set of random variables.    A statistical hypothesis test is a method of statistical inference.  Commonly, two statistical data sets are compared, or a data set obtained by sampling is compared against a synthetic data set from an idealized model.  A hypothesis is proposed for the statistical relationship between the two data sets, and this is compared as an alternative to an idealized null hypothesis that proposes no relationship between two data sets. 

The Hobbit<====>30292<====>The Hobbit The Hobbit, or There and Back Again is a children's fantasy novel by English author J.  R.  R.  Tolkien.

Tax Freedom Day<====>30296<====>Tax Freedom DayTax Freedom Day is the first day of the year in which a nation as a whole has theoretically earned enough income to pay its taxes.   Every dollar that is officially considered income by the government is counted, and every payment to the government that is officially considered a tax is counted.  Taxes at all levels of government – local, state and federal – are included. PurposeAccording to Neil Veldhuis, Director of Fiscal Studies, Fraser Institute, the purpose of Tax Freedom Day is to provide citizens of tax-paying countries with a metric with which to estimate their "total tax bill". 

Tax<====>30297<====>Tax  A tax (from the Latin  ) is a mandatory financial charge or some other type of levy imposed upon a taxpayer (an individual or other legal entity) by a governmental organization in order to fund various public expenditures.   A failure to pay, or evasion of or resistance to taxation, is punishable by law.  Taxes consist of direct or indirect taxes and may be paid in money or as its labour equivalent.  Most countries have a tax system in place to pay for public/common/agreed national needs and government functions: some levy a flat percentage rate of taxation on personal annual income, some on a scale based on annual income amounts, and some countries impose almost no taxation at all, or a very low tax rate for a certain area of taxation. 

Transhumanism<====>30299<====>Transhumanism   Transhumanism (abbreviated as H+ or h+) is an international intellectual movement that aims to transform the human condition by developing and making widely available sophisticated technologies to greatly enhance human intellect and physiology.  Transhumanist thinkers study the potential benefits and dangers of emerging technologies that could overcome fundamental human limitations as well as ethical  limitations of using such technologies.   The most common transhumanist thesis is that human beings may eventually be able to transform themselves into different beings with abilities so greatly expanded from the current condition as to merit the label of posthuman beings.

Third World<====>30305<====>Third World  The term "Third World"  arose during the Cold War to define countries that remained non-aligned with either NATO or the Communist Bloc.  The United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Western European nations and their allies represented the First World, while the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, and their allies represented the Second World.  This terminology provided a way of broadly categorizing the nations of the Earth into three groups based on political and economic divisions. The Third World was normally seen to include many countries with colonial pasts in Africa, Latin America, Oceania and Asia. 

Twin Peaks<====>30307<====>Twin Peaks   Twin Peaks is an American mystery horror drama television series created by Mark Frost and David Lynch that premiered on April 8, 1990, on ABC.

Thallium<====>30309<====>Thallium Thallium is a chemical element with symbol Tl and atomic number 81.  This soft gray post-transition metal is not found free in nature.  When isolated, thallium resembles tin, but discolors when exposed to air.  Chemists William Crookes and Claude-Auguste Lamy discovered thallium independently in 1861, in residues of sulfuric acid production.  Both used the newly developed method of flame spectroscopy, in which thallium produces a notable green spectral line.  Thallium, from Greek  ,  , meaning "a green shoot or twig," was named by Crookes.  It was isolated by both Lamy and Crookes in 1862; Lamy by electrolysis and Crookes by precipitation and melting of the resultant powder. 

Text editor<====>30310<====>Text editor  A text editor is a type of program used for editing plain text files.  Such programs are sometimes known as "notepad" software, following the Microsoft Notepad.    Text editors are provided with operating systems and software development packages, and can be used to change configuration files, documentation files and programming language source code.  Plain text files vs.  word processor files There are important differences between plain text files created by a text editor and document files created by word processors such as Microsoft Word or WordPerfect. A plain text file uses a character encoding such as UTF-8 or ASCII to represent numbers, letters, and symbols. 

Tennis court<====>30311<====>Tennis court  A tennis court is the venue where the sport of tennis is played.  It is a firm rectangular surface with a low net stretched across the center.  The same surface can be used to play both doubles and singles matches.

Ton<====>30318<====>Ton  The ton is a unit of measure.  It has a long history and has acquired a number of meanings and uses over the years.  It is used principally as a unit of mass.  Its original use as a measurement of volume has continued in the capacity of cargo ships and in terms such as the freight ton.  It can also be used as a measure of energy, for truck classification, or as a colloquial term. It is derived from the tun, the term applied to a cask of the largest size.  This could contain a volume between  , which could weigh around   and occupy some   of space. 

Talk (software)<====>30319<====>Talk (software)  talk is a Unix text chat program, originally allowing messaging only between the users logged on to one multi-user computer—but later extended to allow chat to users on other systems. Although largely superseded by IRC and other modern systems, it is still included with most Unix-like systems today, including Linux,   BSD systems  and macOS.  HistorySimilar facilities existed on earlier system such as Multics, CTSS, PLATO, and NLS.   Early versions of talk  did not separate text from each user.   Thus, if each user were to type simultaneously, characters from each user were intermingled. 

Sex Pistols<====>30320<====>Sex PistolsThe Sex Pistols were an English punk rock band that formed in London in 1975.  They were responsible for initiating the punk movement in the United Kingdom and inspiring many later punk and alternative rock musicians.  Although their initial career lasted just two-and-a-half years and produced only four singles and one studio album, Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols, they are regarded as one of the most influential acts in the history of popular music.  The Sex Pistols originally comprised vocalist Johnny Rotten, guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock. 

Transcendental number<====>30325<====>Transcendental numberIn mathematics, a transcendental number is a real or complex number that is not algebraic—that is, it is not a root of a nonzero polynomial equation with integer (or, equivalently, rational) coefficients.  The best-known transcendental numbers are   and e.  Though only a few classes of transcendental numbers are known (in part because it can be extremely difficult to show that a given number is transcendental), transcendental numbers are not rare.  Indeed, almost all real and complex numbers are transcendental, since the algebraic numbers are countable while the sets of real and complex numbers are both uncountable. 

The Terminator<====>30327<====>The Terminator   The Terminator is a 1984 American science-fiction action film directed by James Cameron.  It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator, a cyborg assassin sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), whose son will one day become a savior against machines in a post-apocalyptic future.  Michael Biehn plays Kyle Reese, a soldier from the future sent back in time to protect Connor.  The screenplay is credited to Cameron, along with producer Gale Anne Hurd.  Executive producers John Daly and Derek Gibson of Hemdale Film Corporation were instrumental in the film's financing and production. 

Total order<====>30330<====>Total order  In mathematics, a linear order, total order, simple order, or (non-strict) ordering  is a binary relation on some set  X , which is antisymmetric, transitive, and total (this relation is denoted here by infix  \leq ).  A set paired with a total order is called a totally ordered set, a linearly ordered set, a simply ordered set, or a chain. More symbolically, a set  X  is totally ordered under  \leq  if the following statements hold for all  a, b  and  c  in  X :If  a \leq b  and  b \leq a  then  a = b  (antisymmetry);If  a \leq b  and  b \leq c  then  a \leq c   (transitivity); a \leq b  or  b \leq a  (totality). 

Tactical voting<====>30332<====>Tactical voting    In voting methods, tactical voting (or strategic voting or sophisticated voting or insincere voting) occurs, in elections with more than two candidates, when a voter supports another candidate more strongly than their sincere preference in order to prevent an undesirable outcome.  For example, in a simple plurality election, a voter might sometimes gain a "better" outcome by voting for a less preferred but more generally popular candidate. It has been shown by the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem that any single-winner ranked voting method which is not dictatorial must be susceptible to tactical voting.  However, the type of tactical voting and the extent to which it affects campaigns and election results can vary dramatically from one voting method to another. 

Tetraodontiformes<====>30333<====>Tetraodontiformes  The Tetraodontiformes are an order of highly derived ray-finned fish, also called the Plectognathi.   Sometimes these are classified as a suborder of the order Perciformes.  The Tetraodontiformes are represented by 10 extant families and at least 349 species overall; most are marine and dwell in and around tropical coral reefs, but a few species are found in freshwater streams and estuaries.  They have no close relatives, and descend from a line of coral-dwelling species that emerged around 80 million years ago. DescriptionVarious bizarre forms are included here, all radical departures from the streamlined body plan typical of most fishes. 

Thesaurus<====>30334<====>Thesaurus In general usage, a thesaurus is a reference work that lists words grouped together according to similarity of meaning (containing synonyms and sometimes antonyms), in contrast to a dictionary, which provides definitions for words, and generally lists them in alphabetical order.  The main purpose of such reference works for users "to find the word, or words, by which [an] idea may be most fitly and aptly expressed" – to quote Peter Mark Roget, architect of the best known thesaurus in the English language.  Roget, Peter.  1852.  Thesaurus of English Language Words and Phrases.  Although including synonyms, a thesaurus should not be taken as a complete list of all the synonyms for a particular word. 

Trial of Socrates<====>30337<====>Trial of Socrates  The trial of Socrates (399 BC) was held to determine the philosopher’s guilt of two charges: asebeia (impiety) against the pantheon of Athens, and corruption of the youth of the city-state; the accusers cited two impious acts by Socrates: “failing to acknowledge the gods that the city acknowledges” and “introducing new deities”. The death sentence of Socrates was the legal consequence of asking politico-philosophic questions of his students, from which resulted the two accusations of moral corruption and of impiety.  At trial, the majority of the dikasts (male-citizen jurors chosen by lot) voted to convict him of the two charges; then, consistent with common legal practice, voted to determine his punishment, and agreed to a sentence of death to be executed by Socrates’s drinking a poisonous beverage of hemlock. 

Tetris<====>30339<====>Tetris   Tetris ( , pronounced  ) is a tile-matching puzzle video game, originally designed and programmed by Russian game designer Alexey Pajitnov.It was released on June 6, 1984,  while he was working for the Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre of the Academy of Science of the Soviet Union in Moscow.   He derived its name from the Greek numerical prefix tetra- (all of the game's pieces contain four segments) and tennis, Pajitnov's favorite sport.  Pajitnov interview, G4 "Icons", ep.  305, originally aired on April 22, 2004.   Gerasimov, Vadim. 

Pre-Socratic philosophy<====>30340<====>Pre-Socratic philosophy  Pre-Socratic philosophy is ancient Greek philosophy before Socrates and schools contemporary to Socrates that were not influenced by him.   In Classical antiquity, the Presocratic philosophers were called physiologoi ( ; in English, physical or natural philosophers).   Aristotle was the first to make a clear distinction between these physiologoi or physikoi ("physicists", after physis, "nature") who sought natural explanations for phenomena, and the earlier theologoi (theologians), or mythologoi (story tellers and bards) who attributed these phenomena to various gods.    Diogenes Laërtius divides the physiologoi into two groups: Ionian, led by Anaximander, and the Italiote, led by Pythagoras. 

Transliteration<====>30342<====>Transliteration    Transliteration is a type of conversion of a text from one script to another  that involves swapping letters (thus   +  ) in predictable ways (such as α → a, д → d, χ → ch, ն → n or æ → e). For instance, for the Modern Greek term " ", which is usually translated as "Hellenic Republic", the usual transliteration to Latin script is " ", and the name for Russia in Cyrillic script, " ", is usually transliterated as "Rossiya". Transliteration is not primarily concerned with representing the sounds of the original but rather with representing the characters, ideally accurately and unambiguously. 

Torah<====>30343<====>Torah   The Torah ( ;  , "instruction, teaching") is the central reference of Judaism.  It has a range of meanings.  It can most specifically mean the first five books (Pentateuch) of the 24 books of the Tanakh, and it usually includes the rabbinic commentaries ( ).  The term "Torah" means instruction and offers a way of life for those who follow it; it can mean the continued narrative from the Book of Genesis to the end of the Tanakh, and it can even mean the totality of Jewish teaching, culture and practice, whether derived from biblical texts or later Rabbinic writings. 

Tanakh<====>30344<====>Tanakh   The Tanakh ( ;   ,   or  ; also Tenakh, Tenak, Tanach), also called the Mikra or Hebrew Bible, is the canonical collection of Jewish texts, which is also a textual source for the Christian Old Testament.  These texts are composed mainly in Biblical Hebrew, with some passages in Biblical Aramaic (in the books of Daniel, Ezra and a few others).  The traditional Hebrew text is known as the Masoretic Text.  The Tanakh consists of twenty-four books. Tanakh is an acronym of the first Hebrew letter of each of the Masoretic Text's three traditional subdivisions: Torah ("Teaching", also known as the Five Books of Moses), Nevi'im ("Prophets") and Ketuvim ("Writings")—hence TaNaKh. 

Talmud<====>30345<====>Talmud  The Talmud ( ; Hebrew:"instruction, learning", from a root   "teach, study") is a central text of Rabbinic Judaism.   The term "Talmud" normally refers to the collection of writings named specifically the Babylonian Talmud (Talmud Bavli), although there is also an earlier collection known as the Jerusalem Talmud (Talmud Yerushalmi) or Palestinian Talmud.  It may also traditionally be called   ( ), a Hebrew abbreviation of  , or the "six orders" of the Mishnah.  When referring to the post-biblical periods during which the Talmud was being compiled, those of the Talmudic academies and the Babylonian exilarchate, Jewish sources used the term "Babylonia" long after its geopolitical obsolescence. 

TWERPS<====>30350<====>TWERPS   TWERPS (The World's Easiest Role-Playing System) is a minimalist role-playing game (RPG) originally created by Reindeer Games (whose sole product was the TWERPS line) and distributed by Gamescience.  Presented as a parody of the complicated RPG systems which were prevalent at the time while still being a playable game in its own right, its simple structure and humorous nature gave it unexpected popularity.  TWERPS was originally created, written and illustrated (in a distinctive cartoony style) by "Jeff & 'Manda Dee", Jeff Dee being a noted game illustrator and co-writer of Villains and Vigilantes. Publication historyTWERPS was designed by Jeff Dee and 'Manda Dee, and published by Reindeer Games in 1987 as a digest-sized 8-page pamphlet, with four cardstock sheets. 

The Modern Lovers<====>30351<====>The Modern Lovers  The Modern Lovers was an American rock band led by Jonathan Richman in the 1970s and 1980s.  The original band existed from 1970 to 1974 but their recordings were not released until 1976 or later.  It featured Richman and bassist Ernie Brooks with drummer David Robinson (later of the Cars) and keyboardist Jerry Harrison (later of Talking Heads).  The sound of the band owed a great deal to the influence of the Velvet Underground, and is now sometimes classed as "protopunk".  It pointed the way towards much of the punk rock, new wave, alternative and indie rock music of later decades. 

Trumpet<====>30353<====>Trumpet   A trumpet is a blown musical instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles.  The trumpet group contains the instruments with the highest register in the brass family.  Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signaling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to at least 1500 BC; they began to be used as musical instruments only in the late 14th or early 15th century.Trumpets are used in art music styles, for instance in orchestras, concert bands, and jazz ensembles, as well as in popular music.  They are played by blowing air through nearly-closed lips (called the player's embouchure), producing a "buzzing" sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument.

The fundamental principle underlying Thelema, known as the "law of Thelema", is "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.   Love is the law, love under will. " This phrase can be, and usually is, interpreted universally, having moral, mystical, and socio-political implications. Thelema was developed in the early 1900s by Aleister Crowley, an English writer, mystic, and ceremonial magician.

Transition metal<====>30364<====>Transition metal  In chemistry, the term transition metal (or transition element) has three possible meanings:The IUPAC definition  defines a transition metal as "an element whose atom has a partially filled  d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell". Many scientists describe a "transition metal" as any element in the d-block of the periodic table, which includes groups 3 to 12 on the periodic table.In actual practice, the f-block lanthanide and actinide series are also considered transition metals and are called "inner transition metals". Cotton and Wilkinson  expand the brief IUPAC definition (see above) by specifying which elements are included. 

Taoism<====>30365<====>Taoism   Taoism ( , also  ), also known as Daoism, is a religious or philosophical tradition of Chinese origin which emphasizes living in harmony with the Tao ( ,  also romanized as Dao).  The Tao is a fundamental idea in most Chinese philosophical schools; in Taoism, however, it denotes the principle that is the source, pattern and substance of everything that exists.

Taoist ethics vary depending on the particular school, but in general tend to emphasize wu wei (effortless action), "naturalness", simplicity, spontaneity, and the Three Treasures: 慈 "compassion", 儉 "frugality", and 不敢為天下先 "humility". 

Torr<====>30366<====>Torr   The torr (symbol: Torr) is a unit of pressure based on an absolute scale, now defined as exactly   of a standard atmosphere.   Thus one torr is exactly   (≈ 133. 3 Pa). Historically, one torr was intended to be the same as one "millimeter of mercury".   However,  subsequent redefinitions of the two units made them slightly different (by less than  ).   The torr is not part of the International System of Units (SI), but it is often combined with the metric prefix milli to name one millitorr (mTorr) or 0. 

Trigonometric functions<====>30367<====>Trigonometric functions  In mathematics, the trigonometric functions (also called circular functions, angle functions or goniometric functions  ) are functions of an angle.  They relate the angles of a triangle to the lengths of its sides.  Trigonometric functions are important in the study of triangles and modeling periodic phenomena, among many other applications. The most familiar trigonometric functions are the sine, cosine, and tangent.  In the context of the standard unit circle (a circle with radius 1 unit), where a triangle is formed by a ray starting at the origin and making some angle with the  -axis, the sine of the angle gives the length of the  -component (the opposite to the angle or the rise) of the triangle, the cosine gives the length of the  -component (the adjacent of the angle or the run), and the tangent function gives the slope ( -component divided by the  -component). 

Thermochemistry<====>30369<====>Thermochemistry Thermochemistry is the study of the heat energy associated with chemical reactions and/or physical transformations.   A reaction may release or absorb energy, and a phase change may do the same, such as in melting and boiling.   Thermochemistry focuses on these energy changes, particularly on the system's energy exchange with its surroundings.   Thermochemistry is useful in predicting reactant and product quantities throughout the course of a given reaction.  In combination with entropy determinations, it is also used to predict whether a reaction is spontaneous or non-spontaneous, favorable or unfavorable. Endothermic reactions absorb heat, while  exothermic reactions release heat. 

London Eye<====>30372<====>London Eye   The London Eye is a giant Ferris wheel  on the South Bank of the River Thames in London. The structure is   tall and the wheel has a diameter of  .  When it opened to the public in 2000 it was the world's tallest Ferris wheel.  Its height was surpassed by the   Star of Nanchang in 2006, the   Singapore Flyer in 2008, and the   High Roller (Las Vegas) in 2014.  Supported by an A-frame on one side only, unlike the taller Nanchang and Singapore wheels, the Eye is described by its operators as "the world's tallest cantilevered observation wheel". 

Taekwondo<====>30374<====>TaekwondoTaekwondo (   ,;   from Korean    ) is a Korean martial art, characterized by its emphasis on head-height kicks, jumping and spinning kicks, and fast kicking techniques. Taekwondo was developed during the 1940s and 1950s by various martial artists who combined elements of karate with traditional Korean martial arts traditions such as Taekkyeon, Subak, and Gwonbeop. The oldest governing body for taekwondo is the Korea Taekwondo Association (KTA), formed in 1959 through a collaborative effort by representatives from the nine original kwans, or martial arts schools, in Korea. 

Targum<====>30377<====>Targum  The targumim (singular: "targum",  ) were spoken paraphrases, explanations and expansions of the Jewish scriptures (also called the Tanakh) that a rabbi would give in the common language of the listeners, which was then often Aramaic.  That had become necessary near the end of the 1st century BCE, as the common language was in transition and Hebrew was used for little more than schooling and worship.The noun "Targum" is derived from the early semitic quadriliteral root trgm, and the Akkadian term targummanu refers to "translator, interpreter".

Tosefta<====>30378<====>Tosefta  The Tosefta (Talmudic Aramaic: תוספתא, "supplement, addition") is a compilation of the Jewish oral law from the late 2nd century, the period of the Mishnah. OverviewIn many ways, the Tosefta acts as a supplement to the Mishnah (tosefta means "supplement, addition").  The Mishnah (Hebrew: משנה) is the basic compilation of the Oral law of Judaism; according to the tradition, it was compiled in 189 CE.   The Tosefta closely corresponds to the Mishnah, with the same divisions for sedarim ("orders") and masekhot ("tractates").  It is mainly written in Mishnaic Hebrew, with some Aramaic. At times the text of the Tosefta agrees nearly verbatim with the Mishnah. 

The Evolution of Cooperation<====>30384<====>The Evolution of Cooperation  The evolution of cooperation can refer to:the study of how cooperation can emerge and persist (also known as cooperation theory) as elucidated by application of game theory,a 1981 paper by political scientist Robert Axelrod and evolutionary biologist W.  D.  Hamilton   in the scientific literature, ora 1984 book by Axelrod    that expanded on the paper and popularized the study. This article is an introduction to how game theory and computer modeling are illuminating certain aspects of moral and political philosophy, particularly the role of individuals in groups, the "biology of selfishness and altruism",  and how cooperation can be evolutionarily advantageous. 

The Machinery of Freedom<====>30385<====>The Machinery of Freedom The Machinery of Freedom is a nonfiction book by David D.  Friedman which advocates an anarcho-capitalist society from a utilitarian / consequentialist perspective.   The book was  published in 1973, with a second edition in 1989 and a third edition in 2014. OverviewThe book aims to show that law and its enforcement do not require a state, but can be sustained by non-coercive private enterprise and charity.  It explores the consequences of libertarian thought, describes examples of stateless society (such as the Icelandic Commonwealth), and offers the author's personal statement about why he became a libertarian. 

Tom Stoppard<====>30387<====>Tom Stoppard   Sir Tom Stoppard   HonFBA (born Tomáš Straussler; 3 July 1937) is a Czech-born British playwright and screenwriter, knighted in 1997.He has written prolifically for TV, radio, film and stage, finding prominence with plays such as Arcadia, The Coast of Utopia, Every Good Boy Deserves Favour, Professional Foul, The Real Thing, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.  He co-wrote the screenplays for Brazil, The Russia House, and Shakespeare in Love, and has received one Academy Award and four Tony Awards.Themes of human rights, censorship and political freedom pervade his work along with exploration of linguistics and philosophy. 

Thylacine<====>30388<====>ThylacineThe thylacine (   ,  or    ,  also  ;  Thylacinus cynocephalus) was the largest known carnivorous marsupial of modern times.  It is commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger (because of its striped lower back) or the Tasmanian wolf.   Native to continental Australia, Tasmania and New Guinea, it is believed to have become extinct in the 20th century.  It was the last extant member of its family, Thylacinidae; specimens of other members of the family have been found in the fossil record dating back to the late Oligocene. 

Theodor W. Adorno<====>30391<====>Theodor W.  Adorno   Theodor W.  Adorno ( ;   ; born Theodor Ludwig Wiesengrund; September 11, 1903 – August 6, 1969) was a German philosopher, sociologist, and composer known for his critical theory of society. He was a leading member of the Frankfurt School of critical theory, whose work has come to be associated with thinkers such as Ernst Bloch, Walter Benjamin, Max Horkheimer and Herbert Marcuse, for whom the works of Freud, Marx, and Hegel were essential to a critique of modern society.  He is widely regarded as one of the 20th century's foremost thinkers on aesthetics and philosophy, as well as one of its preeminent essayists. 

Thermophile<====>30393<====>ThermophileA thermophile is an organism—a type of extremophile—that thrives at relatively high temperatures, between  .    Many thermophiles are archaea.  Thermophilic eubacteria are suggested to have been among the earliest bacteria.    Thermophiles are found in various geothermally heated regions of the Earth, such as hot springs like those in Yellowstone National Park (see image) and deep sea hydrothermal vents, as well as decaying plant matter, such as peat bogs and compost. Thermophiles can survive at high temperatures, whereas other bacteria would be damaged and sometimes killed if exposed to the same temperatures.  The enzymes in thermophiles necessarily function at high temperatures. 

Tennessee<====>30395<====>Tennessee    {{Infobox U. S.  state symbols }}Tennessee ( ;  ) is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States.  Tennessee is the 36th largest and the 16th most populous of the 50 United States.  Tennessee is bordered by Kentucky and Virginia to the north, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, and Arkansas and Missouri to the west.  The Appalachian Mountains dominate the eastern part of the state, and the Mississippi River forms the state's western border.  Nashville is the state's capital and largest city, with a population of 660,388. 

Torque<====>30400<====>Torque  Torque, moment, or moment of force is rotational force.   Just as a linear force is a push or a pull, a torque can be thought of as a twist to an object.  In three dimensions, the torque is a pseudovector; for point particles, it is given by the cross product of the position vector (distance vector) and the force vector. The symbol for torque is typically  \tau , the lowercase Greek letter tau.  When it is called moment of force, it is commonly denoted by M. The magnitude of torque of a rigid body depends on three quantities: the force applied, the lever arm vector  connecting the origin to the point of force application, and the angle between the force and lever arm vectors. 

Theory of computation<====>30402<====>Theory of computation In theoretical computer science and mathematics, the theory of computation is the branch that deals with how efficiently problems can be solved on a model of computation, using an algorithm.   The field is divided into three major branches: automata theory and language, computability theory, and computational complexity theory, which are linked by the question: "What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?".    In order to perform a rigorous study of computation, computer scientists work with a mathematical abstraction of computers called a model of computation.   There are several models in use, but the most commonly examined is the Turing machine. 

Turing machine<====>30403<====>Turing machine   A Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine  which manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules.   Despite the model's simplicity, given any computer algorithm, a Turing machine can be constructed that is capable of simulating that algorithm's logic.  The machine operates on an infinite  memory tape divided into discrete cells.   The machine positions its head over a cell and "reads" (scans ) the symbol there.  Then, as per the symbol and its present place in a finite table  of user-specified instructions, the machine (i) writes a symbol (e. 

Trail riding<====>30404<====>Trail riding Trail riding is riding outdoors on trails, bridle paths, and forest roads, but not on roads regularly used by motorised traffic.  A trail ride can be of any length, including a long distance, multi-day trip.  It originated with horse riding, and in North America, the equestrian form is usually called "trail riding," or, less often "hacking. " In the UK and Europe, the practice is usually called horse or pony trekking. The modern term also encompasses mountain biking, mixed terrain cycle-touring, and the use of motorcycles and other motorized all-terrain vehicles.  It may be informal activities of an individual or small group, or larger events organized by a club.

Gilliam has directed 12 feature films, including Time Bandits (1981), Brazil (1985), The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988), 12 Monkeys (1995), Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009).  The only "Python" not born in Britain, he became a naturalised British subject in 1968 and formally renounced his American citizenship in 2006. Gilliam was born in Minnesota, but spent his high school and college years in Los Angeles. 

Tetromino<====>30411<====>TetrominoA tetromino is a geometric shape composed of four squares, connected orthogonally.    This, like dominoes and pentominoes, is a particular type of polyomino.  The corresponding polycube, called a tetracube, is a geometric shape composed of four cubes connected orthogonally. A popular use of tetrominoes is in the video game Tetris, which refers to them under the name tetrimino.  The tetrominoesFree tetrominoesPolyominos are formed by joining unit squares along their edges.  A free polyomino is a polyomino considered up to congruence.  That is, two free polyominos are the same if there is a combination of translations, rotations, and reflections that turns one into the other.

The Marriage of Figaro<====>30418<====>The Marriage of Figaro  The Marriage of Figaro ( ,  ), K.  492, is an opera buffa (comic opera) in four acts composed in 1786 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, with an Italian libretto written by Lorenzo Da Ponte.  It premiered at the Burgtheater in Vienna on 1 May 1786.  The opera's libretto is based on a stage comedy by Pierre Beaumarchais, La folle journée, ou le Mariage de Figaro ("The Mad Day, or The Marriage of Figaro"), which was first performed in 1784.  It tells how the servants Figaro and Susanna succeed in getting married, foiling the efforts of their philandering employer Count Almaviva to seduce Susanna and teaching him a lesson in fidelity. 

The Clash<====>30423<====>The Clash    The Clash  were  an English  rock band formed in London in 1976 as part of the original wave of British punk rock.  Along with punk rock, the Clash also have played music genres such as   experimental rock, and new wave and their music often also incorporated elements of reggae, dub, funk, ska and rockabilly.  For most of their recording career the Clash consisted of Joe Strummer (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Mick Jones (lead guitar, lead vocals), Paul Simonon (bass guitar, vocals) and Nicky "Topper" Headon (drums, percussion).  Headon left the group in 1982, and internal friction led to Jones' departure the following year. 

Total internal reflection<====>30426<====>Total internal reflection Total internal reflection is the phenomenon which occurs when a propagated wave strikes a medium boundary at an angle larger than a particular critical angle with respect to the normal to the surface.  If the refractive index is lower on the other side of the boundary and the incident angle is greater than the critical angle, the wave cannot pass through and is entirely reflected.  The critical angle is the angle of incidence above which the total internal reflection occurs.  This is particularly common as an optical phenomenon, where light waves are involved, but it occurs with many types of waves, such as electromagnetic waves in general or sound waves. 

Inklings<====>30428<====>Inklings   The Inklings was an informal literary discussion group associated with the University of Oxford, England, for nearly two decades between the early 1930s and late 1949.    The Inklings were literary enthusiasts who praised the value of narrative in fiction and encouraged the writing of fantasy. MembersThe more regular members of the Inklings, many of them academics at the University, included: Owen Barfield J.  A.  W.

Treaty<====>30432<====>Treaty A treaty is an agreement under international law entered into by actors in international law, namely sovereign states and international organizations.  A treaty may also be known as an (international) agreement, protocol, covenant, convention, pact, or exchange of letters, among other terms.  Regardless of terminology, all of these forms of agreements are, under international law, equally considered treaties and the rules are the same.  Treaties can be loosely compared to contracts: both are means of willing parties assuming obligations among themselves, and a party to either that fails to live up to their obligations can be held liable under international law. 

Transaction Processing Facility<====>30433<====>Transaction Processing Facility   Transaction Processing Facility (TPF) is an IBM real-time operating system for mainframe computers descended from the IBM System/360 family, including zSeries and System z9. TPF delivers fast, high-volume, high-throughput transaction processing, handling large, continuous loads of essentially simple transactions across large, geographically dispersed networks.  The world's largest TPF-based systems are easily capable of processing tens of thousands of transactions per second.  TPF is also designed for highly reliable, continuous (24×7) operation.  It is not uncommon for TPF customers to have continuous online availability of a decade or more, even with system and software upgrades. 

Thunderbird (mythology)<====>30435<====>Thunderbird (mythology)  The thunderbird is a legendary creature in certain North American indigenous peoples' history and culture.   It is considered a supernatural being of power and strength.   It is especially important, and frequently depicted, in the art, songs and oral histories of many Pacific Northwest Coast cultures, but is also found in various forms among some peoples of the American Southwest, East Coast of the United States, Great Lakes, and Great Plains. Algonquian In Algonquian mythology, the thunderbird controls the upper world while the underworld is controlled by the underwater panther or Great Horned Serpent. 

Theory of everything<====>30436<====>Theory of everything   A theory of everything (ToE), final theory, ultimate theory, or master theory is a hypothetical single, all-encompassing, coherent theoretical framework of physics that fully explains and links together all physical aspects of the universe. Finding a ToE is one of the major unsolved problems in physics.  Over the past few centuries, two theoretical frameworks have been developed that, as a whole, most closely resemble a ToE.  These two theories upon which all modern physics rests are general relativity (GR) and quantum field theory (QFT).  GR is a theoretical framework that only focuses on gravity for understanding the universe in regions of both large-scale and high-mass: stars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, etc. 

Tutankhamun<====>30437<====>Tutankhamun  Tutankhamun ( ;alternatively spelled with Tutenkh-, -amen,  -amon) was an Egyptian pharaoh of the 18th dynasty (ruled c.  1332–1323 BC in the conventional chronology), during the period of Egyptian history known as the New Kingdom or sometimes the New Empire Period.  He has, since the discovery of his intact tomb, been referred to  colloquially as King Tut.  His original name, Tutankhaten, means "Living Image of Aten", while Tutankhamun means "Living Image of Amun".  In hieroglyphs, the name Tutankhamun was typically written Amen-tut-ankh, because of a scribal custom that placed a divine name at the beginning of a phrase to show appropriate reverence. 

Totalitarianism<====>30439<====>Totalitarianism Totalitarianism is a political system where the state recognizes no limits to its authority and strives to regulate every aspect of public and private life wherever feasible.Totalitarian regimes stay in political power through rule by one leader and an all-encompassing propaganda campaign, which is disseminated through the state-controlled mass media, a single party that is often marked by political repression, personality cultism, control over the economy, regulation and restriction of speech, mass surveillance, and widespread use of terror.  A distinctive feature of totalitarian governments is an "elaborate ideology, a set of ideas that gives meaning and direction to the whole society. 

Thomas Gray<====>30440<====>Thomas GrayThomas Gray (26 December 1716 – 30 July 1771) was an English poet, letter-writer, classical scholar, and professor at Pembroke College, Cambridge.  He is widely known for his Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard, published in 1751. Gray was an extremely self-critical writer who published only 13 poems in his lifetime, despite being extremely popular.  He was even offered the position of Poet Laureate in 1757, though he declined. Early life and educationThomas Gray was born in Cornhill, London.  His father, Philip Gray, was a scrivener and his mother, Dorothy Antrobus, was a milliner. 

Taylor series<====>30448<====>Taylor series   In mathematics, a Taylor series is a representation of a function as an infinite sum of terms that are calculated from the values of the function's derivatives at a single point. The concept of a Taylor series was formulated by the Scottish mathematician James Gregory and formally introduced by the English mathematician Brook Taylor in 1715.  If the Taylor series is centered at zero, then that series is also called a Maclaurin series, named after the Scottish mathematician Colin Maclaurin, who made extensive use of this special case of Taylor series in the 18th century.

Dan Murphy, who subsequently worked for Digital Equipment Corporation, developed TECO while still a student at MIT.    The initial acronym was "Tape Editor and Corrector" because "punched paper tape was the only medium for the storage of program source on our PDP-1. 

Topological space<====>30450<====>Topological spaceIn topology and related branches of mathematics, a topological space may be defined as a set of points, along with a set of neighbourhoods for each point, satisfying a set of axioms relating points and neighbourhoods.  The definition of a topological space relies only upon set theory and is the most general notion of a mathematical space that allows for the definition of concepts such as continuity, connectedness, and convergence.   Other spaces, such as manifolds and metric spaces, are specializations of topological spaces with extra structures or constraints.  Being so general, topological spaces are a central unifying notion and appear in virtually every branch of modern mathematics. 

Talking Heads<====>30456<====>Talking Heads    Talking Heads were an American rock band formed in 1975 in New York City and active until 1991.  Talking Heads Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, retrieved November 23, 2008  The band comprised David Byrne (lead vocals, guitar), Chris Frantz (drums), Tina Weymouth (bass), and Jerry Harrison (keyboards, guitar).  Described by critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine as "one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the '80s",    the group helped to pioneer new wave music by integrating elements of punk, art rock, funk, and world music with avant-garde sensibilities and an anxious, clean-cut image. 

Transfinite induction<====>30461<====>Transfinite inductionTransfinite induction is an extension of mathematical induction to well-ordered sets, for example to sets of ordinal numbers or cardinal numbers.Let P(α) be a property defined for all ordinals α. Suppose that whenever P(β) is true for all  β  v_0  and for each ordinal α choosing a vector that is not in the span of the vectors  \{v_{\beta}|\beta . This process stops when no vector can be chosen.More formally, we can state the Transfinite Recursion Theorem as follows:Transfinite Recursion Theorem (version 1). Given a class function  G: V → V (where V is the class of all sets), there exists a unique transfinite sequence F: Ord → V (where Ord is the class of all ordinals) such thatF(α) = G(F  \upharpoonright  α) for all ordinals α, where  \upharpoonright  denotes the restriction of Fs domain to ordinals  1 , and class functions G 2 , G 3 , there exists a unique function F: Ord → V such thatF(0) = g 1 ,F(α + 1) = G 2 (F(α)), for all α ∈ Ord,F(λ) = G 3 (F  \upharpoonright  λ), for all limit λ ≠ 0.Note that we require the domains of G 2 , G 3  to be broad enough to make the above properties meaningful.  The uniqueness of the sequence satisfying these properties can be proved using transfinite induction.More generally, one can define objects by transfinite recursion on any well-founded relation R. (R need not even be a set; it can be a proper class, provided it is a set-like relation; that is, for any x, the collection of all y such that y R x must be a set.)Relationship to the axiom of choiceProofs or constructions using induction and recursion often use the axiom of choice to produce a well-ordered relation that can be treated by transfinite induction. However, if the relation in question is already well-ordered, one can often use transfinite induction without invoking the axiom of choice.  For example, many results about Borel sets are proved by transfinite induction on the ordinal rank of the set; these ranks are already well-ordered, so the axiom of choice is not needed to well-order them.The following construction of the Vitali set shows one way that the axiom of choice can be used in a proof by transfinite induction:First, well-order the real numbers (this is where the axiom of choice enters via the well-ordering theorem), giving a sequence   \langle r_{\alpha} | \alpha  , where β is an ordinal with the cardinality of the continuum.  Let v 0  equal r 0 .  Then let v 1  equal r α 1  , where α 1  is least such that r α 1   − v 0  is not a rational number.  Continue; at each step use the least real from the r sequence that does not have a rational difference with any element thus far constructed in the v sequence.  Continue until all the reals in the r sequence are exhausted.  The final v sequence will enumerate the Vitali set.The above argument uses the axiom of choice in an essential way at the very beginning, in order to well-order the reals. After that step, the axiom of choice is not used again.Other uses of the axiom of choice are more subtle. For example, a construction by transfinite recursion frequently will not specify a unique value for A α+1 , given the sequence up to α, but will specify only a condition that A α+1  must satisfy, and argue that there is at least one set satisfying this condition. If it is not possible to define a unique example of such a set at each stage, then it may be necessary to invoke (some form of) the axiom of choice to select one such at each step.  For inductions and recursions of countable length, the weaker axiom of dependent choice is sufficient. Because there are models of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory of interest to set theorists that satisfy the axiom of dependent choice but not the full axiom of choice, the knowledge that a particular proof only requires dependent choice can be useful.See alsoMathematical induction∈-inductionTransfinite numberWell-founded inductionNotes References External links  

Triple point<====>30462<====>Triple point In thermodynamics, the triple point of a substance is the temperature and pressure at which the three phases (gas, liquid, and solid) of that substance coexist in thermodynamic equilibrium.For example, the triple point of mercury occurs at a temperature of −38. 83440 °C and a pressure of 0. 2 mPa. In addition to the triple point for solid, liquid, and gas phases, a triple point may involve more than one solid phase, for substances with multiple polymorphs.  Helium-4 is a special case that presents a triple point involving two different fluid phases (lambda point). 

Taxonomy (biology)<====>30463<====>Taxonomy (biology) Taxonomy ( ) is the science of defining and naming groups of biological organisms on the basis of shared characteristics.  Organisms are grouped together into taxa (singular: taxon) and these groups are given a taxonomic rank; groups of a given rank can be aggregated to form a super-group of higher rank, thus creating a taxonomic hierarchy.  The principal ranks in modern use are domain, kingdom, phylum (division is sometimes used in botany in place of phylum), class, order, family, genus and species.  The Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus is regarded as the father of taxonomy, as he developed a system known as Linnaean taxonomy for categorization of organisms and binomial nomenclature for naming organisms. 

Tyrannosaurus<====>30467<====>TyrannosaurusTyrannosaurus  is a genus of coelurosaurian theropod dinosaur.  The species Tyrannosaurus rex (rex meaning "king" in Latin) is one of the most well-represented of the large theropods.  Tyrannosaurus lived throughout what is now western North America, on what was then an island continent known as Laramidia.  Tyrannosaurus had a much wider range than other tyrannosaurids.  Fossils are found in a variety of rock formations dating to the Maastrichtian age of the upper Cretaceous Period, 68 to 66 million years ago.It was the last known member of the tyrannosaurids,  and among the last non-avian dinosaurs to exist before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction. 

Tollund Man<====>30468<====>Tollund ManTollund Man is a naturally mummified corpse of a man who lived during the 4th century BC, during the period characterised in Scandinavia as the Pre-Roman Iron Age.He was found in 1950 on the Jutland Peninsula in Denmark, buried in a peat bog which preserved his body.  Such a find is known as a bog body.The man's physical features were so well-preserved that he was mistaken at the time of discovery for a recent murder victim.   Twelve years before Tollund Man's discovery, another bog body, Elling Woman, had been found in the same bog.

In addition, he founded WTBS, which pioneered the superstation concept in cable television. As a philanthropist, he is known for his $1 billion gift to support the United Nations, which created the United Nations Foundation, a public charity to broaden domestic support for the UN.  Turner serves as Chairman of the United Nations Foundation board of directors. 

Tanka<====>30476<====>Tanka    is a genre of classical Japanese poetry and one of the major genres of Japanese literature.  EtymologyOriginally, in the time of the Man'yōshū (latter half of the eighth century AD), the term tanka was used to distinguish "short poems" from the longer  .  In the ninth and tenth centuries, however, notably with the compilation of the Kokinshū, the short poem became the dominant form of poetry in Japan, and the originally general word waka became the standard name for this form.

Turbomolecular pump<====>30494<====>Turbomolecular pump  A turbomolecular pump is a type of vacuum pump, superficially similar to a turbopump, used to obtain and maintain high vacuum.   These pumps work on the principle that gas molecules can be given momentum in a desired direction by repeated collision with a moving solid surface.  In a turbomolecular pump, a rapidly spinning fan rotor 'hits' gas molecules from the inlet of the pump towards the exhaust in order to create or maintain a vacuum. Operating principlesMost turbomolecular pumps employ multiple stages, each consisting of a quickly rotating rotor blade and stationary stator blade pair. 

Tour de France<====>30498<====>Tour de France    The Tour de France ( ) is an annual multiple stage bicycle race primarily held in France,    while also occasionally making passes through nearby countries.

Theology<====>30503<====>Theology   Theology is the critical study of the nature of the divine.  It is taught as an academic discipline, typically in universities, seminaries, and schools of divinity.  Etymology Theology translates into English from the Greek theologia (θεολογία) which derived from Τheos (Θεός), meaning "God," and -logia (-λογία),  meaning "utterances, sayings, or oracles" (a word related to logos [λόγος], meaning "word, discourse, account, or reasoning") which had passed into Latin as theologia and into French as théologie.  The English equivalent "theology" (Theologie, Teologye) had evolved by 1362.   The sense the word has in English depends in large part on the sense the Latin and Greek equivalents had acquired in patristic and medieval Christian usage, although the English term has now spread beyond Christian contexts.

In this context, a "nature" is what one is, whereas a "person" is who one is.The opposing view is referred to as Nontrinitarianism. According to this central mystery of most Christian faiths, there is only one God in three Persons: while distinct from one another in their relations of origin (as the Fourth Council of the Lateran declared, "it is the Father who generates, the Son who is begotten, and the Holy Spirit who proceeds")  and in their relations with one another, they are stated to be one in all else, co-equal, co-eternal and consubstantial, and each is God, whole and entire.

Toxicology<====>30531<====>Toxicology  Toxicology is a discipline, overlapping with biology, chemistry, pharmacology, and medicine, that involves the study of the adverse effects of chemical substances on living organisms  and the practice of diagnosing and treating exposures to toxins and toxicants.  The relationship between dose and its effects on the exposed organism is of high significance in toxicology.  Factors that influence chemical toxicity include the dosage (and whether it is acute or chronic), route of exposure, species, age, sex, and environment.  Toxicologists are experts on poisons and poisoning. HistoryDioscorides, a Greek physician in the court of the Roman emperor Nero, made the first attempt to classify plants according to their toxic and therapeutic effect.

Transmission Control Protocol<====>30538<====>Transmission Control ProtocolThe Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite.  It originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented the Internet Protocol (IP).  Therefore, the entire suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP.  TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets between applications running on hosts communicating by an IP network.  Major Internet applications such as the World Wide Web, email, remote administration, and file transfer rely on TCP.  Applications that do not require reliable data stream service may use the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which provides a connectionless datagram service that emphasizes reduced latency over reliability.

Twelve minor planets   is excluded from the count because it has an observation arc of only 76 days and hence its semi-major axis is not securely known.   with a semi-major axis greater than 150 AU and perihelion greater than 30 AU are known, which are called extreme trans-Neptunian objects (ETNOs).    The first trans-Neptunian object to be discovered was   in 1930.

Taxation in the United States<====>30552<====>Taxation in the United States  The United States of America has separate federal, state, and local government(s) with taxes imposed at each of these levels.  Taxes are levied on income, payroll, property, sales, capital gains, dividends, imports, estates and gifts, as well as various fees.  In 2010, taxes collected by federal, state, and municipal governments amounted to 24. 8% of GDP.  In the OECD, only Chile and Mexico are taxed less as a share of their GDP.   However, taxes fall much more heavily on labor income than on capital income.  Divergent taxes and subsidies for different forms of income and spending can also constitute a form of indirect taxation of some activities over others. 

Tychonoff space<====>30554<====>Tychonoff space In topology and related branches of mathematics, Tychonoff spaces and completely regular spaces are kinds of topological spaces. These conditions are examples of separation axioms. Tychonoff spaces are named after Andrey Nikolayevich Tychonoff, whose Russian name (Тихонов) is variously rendered as "Tychonov", "Tikhonov", "Tihonov", "Tichonov" etc. DefinitionsSuppose that X is a topological space. X is a completely regular space if given any closed set F and any point x that does not belong to F, then there is a continuous function f from X to the real line R such that f(x) is   and, for every y in F, f(y) is  . 

Tattoo<====>30555<====>Tattoo  A tattoo is a form of body modification where a design is made by inserting ink, dyes and pigments, either indelible or temporary, into the dermis layer of the skin to change the pigment.  Tattoos fall into three broad categories: purely decorative (with no specific meaning); symbolic (with a specific meaning pertinent to the wearer); pictorial (a depiction of a specific person or item).  Tattoos have historically been regarded in the West as 'uncivilised', and over the last 100 years the fashion has been associated mainly with sailors, working men and criminals.  By the end of the 20th Century many Western stigmas of the tattoo culture had been dismissed and the practice has become more acceptable and accessible for people of all trades and levels of society.

Tallage<====>30561<====>TallageTallage or talliage (from the French tailler, i. e.   a part cut out of the whole) may have signified at first any tax, but became in England and France a land use or land tenure tax.  Later in England it was further limited to assessments by the crown upon cities, boroughs, and royal domains.  In effect, tallage was a land tax. EnglandLand taxes were not unknown in England, as the Anglo-Saxon kings had periodically levied a Danegeld on that basis, but tallage was brought to England by the Normans as a feudal duty.  Under the sons of Henry II it became a common source of royal revenue. 

Glossary of topology<====>30562<====>Glossary of topologyThis is a glossary of some terms used in the branch of mathematics known as topology.  Although there is no absolute distinction between different areas of topology, the focus here is on general topology.  The following definitions are also fundamental to algebraic topology, differential topology and geometric topology. All spaces in this glossary are assumed to be topological spaces unless stated otherwise.  AAbsolutely closedSee H-closedAccessibleSee  T_1 . Accumulation pointSee limit point. Alexandrov topologyThe topology of a space X is an Alexandrov topology (or is finitely generated) if arbitrary intersections of open sets in X are open, or equivalently, if arbitrary unions of closed sets are closed, or, again equivalently, if the open sets are the upper sets of a poset.

Personal lifeKing is the eldest daughter of Sarah Jane Spruce (née White; December 7, 1923 – April 14, 2007)   and Raymond George Spruce (December 29, 1923 – May 29, 2014).   King attended college at the University of Maine, where she met her husband Stephen King through her work-study job in the Raymond H.  Fogler Library.  The two married on January 7, 1971.   King had her first child, Naomi Rachel King in 1970. 

12 Monkeys<====>30575<====>12 Monkeys   12 Monkeys, also known as Twelve Monkeys, is a 1995 American neo-noir science fiction film directed by Terry Gilliam, inspired by Chris Marker's 1962 short film La Jetée, and starring Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe, and Brad Pitt, with Christopher Plummer and David Morse in supporting roles.  After Universal Studios acquired the rights to remake La Jetée as a full-length film, David and Janet Peoples were hired to write the script. Under Gilliam's direction, Universal granted the filmmakers a $29. 5 million budget, and filming lasted from February to May 1995.  The film was shot mostly in Philadelphia and Baltimore, where the story was set. 

Sealed Knot<====>30577<====>Sealed Knot The Sealed Knot was a secret Royalist association which plotted for the Restoration of the Monarchy during the English Interregnum. The group was commissioned by King Charles II between November 1653 and February 1654 from his exile in Paris for the purpose of coordinating underground Royalist activity in England and preparing for a general uprising against the Protectorate.    Its original founder members were: John Belasyse, 1st Baron Belasyse (1614-1689)Sir William Compton (1625-1663; third son of Spencer Compton, 2nd Earl of Northampton)Henry Hastings, 1st Baron Loughborough (1610-1666)Col.  John RussellCol.  Sir Edward Villiers (1620-1689; father of Edward Villiers, 1st Earl of Jersey)Sir Richard Willis (sometimes spelt 'Willys') (1613/14-1690)The Sealed Knot made eight attempts between 1652 and 1659 to bring about the Restoration. 

The Crying Game<====>30581<====>The Crying Game    The Crying Game is a 1992 British-Irish-Japanese thriller film written and directed by Neil Jordan.  The film explores themes of race, gender, nationality, and sexuality against the backdrop of the Troubles in Northern Ireland.  The film is about the experiences of the main character, Fergus (Stephen Rea), a member of the IRA, his brief but meaningful encounter with a soldier, Jody (Forest Whitaker), who is held prisoner by the group, and his unexpected romantic relationship with Jody's girlfriend, Dil (Jaye Davidson), whom Fergus promised Jody he would protect.  However, unexpected events force Fergus to decide what he wants for the future, and ultimately what his nature dictates he must do. 

The Sixth Sense<====>30582<====>The Sixth Sense   The Sixth Sense is a 1999 American supernatural horror film written and directed by M.  Night Shyamalan.  The film tells the story of Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a troubled, isolated boy who is able to see and talk to the dead, and an equally troubled child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) who tries to help him.  The film established Shyamalan as a writer and director, and introduced the cinema public to his traits, most notably his affinity for surprise endings. Released by Hollywood Pictures on August 6, 1999, the film was received well; critics highlighted the performances (especially by Osment, Collette and Willis), its atmosphere, and twist conclusion. 

Thirty Years' War<====>30583<====>Thirty Years' War  The Thirty Years' War was a war fought primarily in Central Europe between 1618 and 1648.  One of the longest and most destructive conflicts in human history,  as well as the deadliest European religious war in history, the war resulted in eight million fatalities.  Initially a war between various Protestant and Catholic states in the fragmented Holy Roman Empire, it gradually developed into a more general conflict involving most of the great powers.  These states employed relatively large mercenary armies, and the war became less about religion and more of a continuation of the France–Habsburg rivalry for European political pre-eminence. 

Table tennis<====>30589<====>Table tennis    Table tennis, also known as ping pong, is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball back and forth across a table using small bats.  The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net.  Except for the initial serve, the rules are generally as follows: players must allow a ball played toward them to bounce one time on their side of the table, and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side at least once.  A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules. 

Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty<====>30592<====>Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty   The Partial Test Ban Treaty (PTBT) is the abbreviated name of the 1963 Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water, which prohibited all test detonations of nuclear weapons except for those conducted underground.  It is also abbreviated as the Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT) and Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (NTBT), though the latter may also refer to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which succeeded the PTBT for ratifying parties. Negotiations initially focused on a comprehensive ban, but this was abandoned due to technical questions surrounding the detection of underground tests and Soviet concerns over the intrusiveness of proposed verification methods. 

Tribune<====>30594<====>Tribune   Tribunus, in English tribune, was the title of various elected officials in Ancient Rome.   The two most important were the tribunes of the plebs and the military tribunes.   For most of Roman history, a college of ten tribunes of the plebs acted as a check on the authority of the senate and the annual magistrates, holding the power of ius intercessionis to intervene on behalf of the plebeians, and veto unfavourable legislation.   There were also military tribunes, who commanded portions of the Roman army, subordinate to the higher magistrates, such as the consuls and praetors, promagistrates, and their legates. 

Train<====>30598<====>Train    A train is a form of rail transport consisting of a series of connected vehicles that usually runs along a rail track to transport cargo or passengers.  Motive power is provided by a separate locomotive or individual motors in self-propelled multiple unit.  Although historically steam propulsion dominated, the most common modern forms are diesel and electric locomotives, the latter supplied by overhead wires or additional rails.  Other energy sources include horses, engine or water-driven rope or wire winch, gravity, pneumatics, gas turbines and batteries.  Train tracks usually consist of two running rails, sometimes supplemented by additional rails such as electric conducting rails and rack rails, with a limited number of monorails and maglev guideways in the mix.

Tunnels & Trolls<====>30600<====>Tunnels & Trolls Tunnels & Trolls (abbreviated T&T) is a fantasy role-playing game designed by Ken St.  Andre and first published in 1975 by Flying Buffalo.  The second modern role-playing game published, it was written by Ken St.  Andre to be a more accessible alternative to Dungeons & Dragons   and is suitable for solitaire, group, and play-by-mail gameplay. HistorySt.  Andre, a public librarian in Phoenix, Arizona, liked the idea of fantasy role-playing after reading a friend's D&D rule books but found the actual rules confusing, so he wrote his own.  The first edition of Tunnels & Trolls was self-published in April 1975. 

Trombetas River<====>30601<====>Trombetas River The Trombetas is a large river on the northern side of the Amazon River. CourseThe Trombetas is   long, and is navigable by 500 ton vessels for a stretch of  . It is formed by the junction of the Poana and Anuma rivers on the border between Brazil and Guyana. Where it meets the Paraná de Sapucuá it takes the name of lower Trombetas, and reaches up to   in width, with the stream divided by several long and narrow islands. It runs through the municipalities of Oriximiná, Terra Santa, Óbidos and Faro.  The river basin has an area of about  , with an intricate pattern of tributaries including the Poana, Anamu, Turuna, Inhabu, Mapuera and Paru de Oeste. 

Tigre River<====>30602<====>Tigre River  The Tigre River ( ) is a Peruvian tributary of the Marañón River west of the Nanay River.  It is navigable for   from its confluence with the Marañón.   It forms from the confluence of the Ecuadorian rivers Cunambo and Pintoyacu at the Peruvian border.  Like the Nanay, it flows entirely on the plains.   Its mouth is   west of the junction of the Ucayali River with the Marañón.   Continuing west from the Tigre along the Marañón River we have the Parinari, Chambira, and Nucuray, all short lowland streams, resembling the Nanay in character. 

Twelve-bar blues<====>30603<====>Twelve-bar blues  The twelve-bar blues or blues changes is one of the most prominent chord progressions in popular music.  The blues progression has a distinctive form in lyrics, phrase, chord structure, and duration.  In its basic form, it is predominantly based on the I, IV, and V chords of a key. The blues can be played in any key.  Mastery of the blues and rhythm changes are "critical elements for building a jazz repertoire".  StructureIn the key of C, one basic blues progression (E from above) is as follows.   (For the most commonly used patterns see the section "Variations", below. 

Trimalchio<====>30604<====>TrimalchioTrimalchio is a character in the 1st century AD Roman work of fiction Satyricon by Petronius.  He plays a part only in the section titled "Cena Trimalchionis" (The Banquet of Trimalchio, often translated as "Dinner With Trimalchio").  Trimalchio is an arrogant former slave, who has become quite wealthy by tactics that most would find distasteful.  The name "Trimalchio" is formed from the Greek prefix τρις and the Semitic מלך (melech) in its occidental form Malchio or Malchus.The fundamental meaning of the root is "King", and the name "Trimalchio" would thus mean "Thrice King", "greatest King". 

Tetrahedron<====>30606<====>Tetrahedron   In geometry, a tetrahedron (plural: tetrahedra or tetrahedrons), also known as a triangular pyramid, is a polyhedron composed of four triangular faces, six straight edges, and four vertex corners.  The tetrahedron is the simplest of all the ordinary convex polyhedra and the only one that has fewer than 5 faces.    The tetrahedron is the three-dimensional case of the more general concept of a Euclidean simplex, and may thus also be called a 3-simplex. The tetrahedron is one kind of pyramid, which is a polyhedron with a flat polygon base and triangular faces connecting the base to a common point. 

Track cycling<====>30611<====>Track cycling  Track cycling is a bicycle racing sport usually held on specially built banked tracks or velodromes (but many events are held at older velodromes where the track banking is relatively shallow) using track bicycles. HistoryTrack cycling has been around since at least 1870.  When cycling was in its infancy, wooden indoor tracks were laid which resemble those of modern velodromes, consisting of two straights and slightly banked turns. One appeal of indoor track racing was that spectators could be easily controlled, and hence an entrance fee could be charged, making track racing a lucrative sport.  Early track races attracted crowds of up to 2000 people. 

Individual pursuit<====>30613<====>Individual pursuit The individual pursuit is a track cycling event where two cyclists begin the race from a stationary position on opposite sides of the track.  The event is held over   for men and   for women.  The two riders start at the same time and set off to complete the race distance in the fastest time.  They will ride on the pursuit line at the bottom of the track in order to find the fastest line.  This race makes for a good spectacle as the two riders pursue each other attempting to catch the other rider who started on the other side of the track. 

Team pursuit<====>30614<====>Team pursuit   The team pursuit is a track cycling event similar to the individual pursuit, except that two teams, each of up to four riders, compete, starting on opposite sides of the velodrome. Race formatBoth men's and women's events are competed over a distance of 4 km, by a team of 4 riders.  Prior to the start of the 2012-13 season the women's event was competed over a distance of 3 km, by a team of 3 riders.   As with the individual pursuit, the objective is to cover the distance in the fastest time or to catch and overtake the other team in a final. 

Track time trial<====>30615<====>Track time trial In the track time trial, a track cycling event, cyclists compete individually against the clock to record the fastest time over the specified distance from a standing start. The bikeTrack time trial bikes differ from normal track bikes in two major ways; firstly they have disc or 3–5 spoked wheels and secondly they often use aero-bars to allow the rider to adopt a more aerodynamic riding position, for the same reasons as in road individual time trials.   The frames are often more streamlined to reduce air resistance. Men – 1 km Time TrialAt the UCI Track World Championships, the distance for senior men is 1,000 metres, hence the event's alternative name, the 'Kilo', short for kilometer. 

Points race<====>30616<====>Points race A points race is a mass start track cycling event involving large numbers of riders simultaneously on track.  It was an Olympic event for men between 1984–2008 and for women 1996–2008.  Starting in 2012, the points race is one of the omnium events in the Olympics. Description and tacticsThis race can be one of the more confusing races to watch for less familiar viewers.  Put simply, it is a race over a long distance, with 40 km for men and 25 km for women in UCI championships.  A sprint is held every ten laps, with 5, 3, 2, and 1 point(s) being awarded to the top four finishers in each sprint. 

Madison (cycling)<====>30617<====>Madison (cycling) The madison is a team event in track cycling, named after the first Madison Square Garden in New York, and known as the "American race" in French (course à l'américaine) and in Italian and Spanish as Americana. The raceThe madison is a conventional race but, since the innovation in New York, with riders in each team riding part of the distance, handing over to the other member, resting, and then returning to the race.  Teams are usually of two riders but occasionally of three.  Only one of the team is racing at any time and the replacement rider has to be touched before he can take over. 

Sprint (track cycling)<====>30618<====>Sprint (track cycling) The sprint or match sprint is a track cycling event involving between two and four riders, though it is usually run as a one-on-one match race between opponents who, unlike in the individual pursuit, start next to each other. Racing styleDepending on the size of the velodrome, this event can be from 250 m to 1000 m.   Unlike the sprints in athletics, these events do not usually start with riders sprinting from the starting line and they are not confined to lanes.  The early parts of each race will often be highly tactical with riders pedalling slowly, as they carefully jockey for position, often trying to force their opponents up high on the track in an attempt to get their rivals to make the first move. 

Keirin<====>30619<====>Keirin    – literally "competition ring" – is a form of motor-paced cycle racing in which track cyclists sprint for victory following a speed-controlled start behind a motorized or non-motorized pacer.  It was developed in Japan around 1948 for gambling purposes and became an official event at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Races are typically   long: 6 laps on a   track, 4 laps on a   track, 4 laps on a   track.  Lots are drawn to determine starting positions for the sprint riders behind the pacer, which is usually a motorcycle, but can be a derny, electric bicycle or tandem bicycle. 

Turing completeness<====>30621<====>Turing completeness   In computability theory, a system of data-manipulation rules (such as a computer's instruction set, a programming language, or a cellular automaton) is said to be Turing complete or computationally universal if it can be used to simulate any Turing machine.  The concept is named after English mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing.  A classic example is lambda calculus. A closely related concept is that of Turing equivalence  two computers P and Q are called equivalent if P can simulate Q and Q can simulate P.  The Church–Turing thesis conjectures that any function whose values can be computed by an algorithm can be computed by a Turing machine, and therefore that if any real-world computer can simulate a Turing machine, it is Turing equivalent to a Turing machine. 

The Shawshank Redemption<====>30625<====>The Shawshank Redemption   The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, based on the 1982 Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.  It tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murder of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence.  Over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and becomes instrumental in a money laundering operation led by the prison warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton). 

The Residents<====>30629<====>The Residents   The Residents are an American art collective best known for avant-garde music and multimedia works.  Since their first official release, Meet the Residents (1974), the group has released over sixty albums, numerous music videos and short films, three CD-ROM projects, and ten DVDs.  They have undertaken seven major world tours and scored multiple films.  Pioneers in exploring the potential of CD-ROM and similar technologies, the Residents have won several awards for their multimedia projects.  Ralph Records, a record label focusing on avant-garde music, was started by the band. Throughout the group's existence, the individual members have ostensibly attempted to operate under anonymity, preferring instead to have attention focused on their art output. 

Tacitus on Christ<====>30632<====>Tacitus on Christ The Roman historian and senator Tacitus referred to Christ, his execution by Pontius Pilate, and the existence of early Christians in Rome in one page of his final work, Annals (written ca.  AD 116),  .  The context of the passage is the six-day Great Fire of Rome that burned much of the city in AD 64 during the reign of Roman Emperor Nero.  Stephen Dando-Collins 2010 The Great Fire of Rome   pages 1-4  The passage is one of the earliest non-Christian references to the origins of Christianity, the execution of Christ described in the canonical gospels, and the presence and persecution of Christians in 1st-century Rome. 

The Fantasy Trip<====>30633<====>The Fantasy Trip  The Fantasy Trip (TFT) is a role-playing game that was designed by Steve Jackson and was published by Metagaming Concepts. It was developed from Metagaming's Melee and Wizard MicroGames, also designed by Steve Jackson, which provided the basic combat and magic rules.  These games could be played on their own, or, using the "Gamemasters" module In the Labyrinth, expanded into a full-fledged role-playing game.  The basic combat and magic rules presented in Melee and Wizard were greatly expanded specifically for purposes of role-playing in Advanced Melee and Advanced Wizard.   It was the first published role-playing game to use a point-buy system for character generation, instead of the random dice roll method routinely used in the 1970s. 

Taliban<====>30635<====>Taliban The Taliban (    "students"), alternatively spelled Taleban, which refers to itself as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA),  is a Sunni Islamic fundamentalist political movement in Afghanistan currently waging war (an insurgency, or jihad) within that country.   (". . . The Taliban . . .  have repeatedly said that their jihad is limited to their own country. . . ")   Since 2016, the Taliban's leader is Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada.  From 1996 to 2001, the Taliban held power over roughly three quarters of Afghanistan, and enforced there a strict interpretation of Sharia, or Islamic law. 

Terrorism<====>30636<====>TerrorismTerrorism is, in the broadest sense, the use of intentionally indiscriminate violence as a means to create terror, or fear, to achieve a financial, political, religious or ideological aim.   It is used in this regard primarily to refer to violence against peacetime targets or in war against non-combatants.   The terms "terrorist" and "terrorism" originated during the French Revolution of the late 18th century    but gained mainstream popularity during the U. S.  Presidency of Ronald Reagan (1981–89) after the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings    and again after the attacks on New York City and Washington, D. 

Thomas Malory<====>30638<====>Thomas Malory  Sir Thomas Malory (c.  1415 – 14 March 1471) was an English writer, the author or compiler of Le Morte d'Arthur.  Since the late nineteenth century, he has generally been identified as Sir Thomas Malory of Newbold Revel in Warwickshire,  a knight, land-owner, and Member of Parliament.   Previously, it was suggested by antiquary John Leland and John Bale that he was Welsh (identifying "Malory" with "Maelor").  The name could also be rooted in Irish & Scottish Gaelic and mean "follower of the king," as in "maol" ("follower") and "ry" or "ree" ("king"). 

The Black Cat (short story)<====>30641<====>The Black Cat (short story)  "The Black Cat" is a short story by American writer Edgar Allan Poe.  It was first published in the August 19, 1843, edition of The Saturday Evening Post.  It is a study of the psychology of guilt,  often paired in analysis with Poe's "The Tell-Tale Heart".   In both, a murderer carefully conceals his crime and believes himself unassailable, but eventually breaks down and reveals himself, impelled by a nagging reminder of his guilt. Plot The story is presented as a first-person narrative using an unreliable narrator.  He is a condemned man at the outset of the story. 

Golden Brown<====>30644<====>Golden Brown    "Golden Brown" is a song by the English rock band the Stranglers.  It was released as a 7" single in December 1981 in the United States and in January 1982 in the United Kingdom, on Liberty.  It was the second single released from the band's sixth album La folie.  It peaked at No.  2 in the UK Singles Chart, the band's highest ever placing in that chart.  In January 2014, NME ranked the song as No.  488 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.   It has also been recorded by many other artists. 

Buzzcocks<====>30645<====>Buzzcocks    Buzzcocks are an English punk rock band, formed in Bolton, England in 1976 by singer-songwriter-guitarist Pete Shelley and singer-songwriter Howard Devoto.   They are regarded as an important influence on the Manchester music scene, the independent record label movement, punk rock, power pop,  and indie rock.  They achieved commercial success with singles that fused pop craftsmanship with rapid-fire punk energy.  These singles were collected on Singles Going Steady, described by critic Ned Raggett as a "punk masterpiece".  Devoto and Shelley chose the name "Buzzcocks" after reading the headline, "It's the Buzz, Cock!", in a review of the TV series Rock Follies in Time Out magazine. 

Tidal acceleration<====>30647<====>Tidal accelerationTidal acceleration is an effect of the tidal forces between an orbiting natural satellite (e. g.  the Moon), and the primary planet that it orbits (e. g.  Earth).   The acceleration causes a gradual recession of a satellite in a prograde orbit away from the primary, and a corresponding slowdown of the primary's rotation.  The process eventually leads to tidal locking, usually of the smaller first, and later the larger body.  The Earth–Moon system is the best studied case. The similar process of tidal deceleration occurs for satellites that have an orbital period that is shorter than the primary's rotational period, or that orbit in a retrograde direction. 

Timor<====>30648<====>Timor   Timor is an island at the southern end of Maritime Southeast Asia, north of the Timor Sea.  The island is divided between the sovereign states of East Timor on the eastern part and Indonesia, on the western part.  The Indonesian part, also known as West Timor, constitutes part of the province of East Nusa Tenggara.  Within West Timor lies an exclave of East Timor called Oecusse District.  The island covers an area of  .  The name is a variant of timur, Malay for "east"; it is so called because it lies at the eastern end of the Lesser Sunda Islands. 

Tetracycline<====>30649<====>Tetracycline   Tetracycline, sold under the brand name Sumycin among others, is an antibiotic used to treat a number of infections.   This includes acne, cholera, brucellosis, plague, malaria, and syphilis.   It is taken by mouth.   Common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and loss of appetite.   Other side effects include poor tooth development if used by children less than eight years of age, kidney problems, and sunburning easily.   Use during pregnancy may harm the baby.   Tetracycline is in the tetracyclines family of medications.   It works by blocking the  ability of bacteria to make proteins. 

Transposable element<====>30651<====>Transposable element A transposable element (TE or transposon) is a DNA sequence that can change its position within a genome, sometimes creating or reversing mutations and altering the cell's genetic identity and genome size.  Transposition often results in duplication of the same genetic material.  Barbara McClintock's discovery of these jumping genes  earned her a Nobel Prize in 1983.  Transposable elements make up a large fraction of the genome and are responsible for much of the mass of DNA in a eukaryotic cell.  It has been shown that TEs are important in genome function and evolution. 

Trypsin<====>30652<====>Trypsin  Trypsin   ( ) is a serine protease from the PA clan superfamily, found in the digestive system of many vertebrates, where it hydrolyzes proteins. Trypsin is formed in the small intestine when its proenzyme form, the trypsinogen produced by the pancreas, is activated.  Trypsin cleaves peptide chains mainly at the carboxyl side of the amino acids lysine or arginine, except when either is followed by proline.   It is used for numerous biotechnological processes.  The process is commonly referred to as trypsin proteolysis or trypsinisation, and proteins that have been digested/treated with trypsin are said to have been trypsinized. 

Tuberculosis<====>30653<====>Tuberculosis Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease usually caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB).   Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body.   Most infections do not have symptoms, in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis.   About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those infected.   The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss.   The historical term "consumption" came about due to the weight loss. 

Triangle<====>30654<====>Triangle A triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices.  It is one of the basic shapes in geometry.  A triangle with vertices A, B, and C is denoted  \triangle ABC . In Euclidean geometry any three points, when non- , determine a unique triangle and simultaneously, a unique plane (i. e.  a two-dimensional Euclidean space).  In other words, there is only one plane that contains that triangle, and every triangle is contained in some plane.  If the entire geometry is only the Euclidean plane, there is only one plane and all triangles are contained in it; however, in higher dimensional Euclidean spaces this is no longer true. 

Torino scale<====>30656<====>Torino scaleThe Torino Scale is a method for categorizing the impact hazard associated with near-Earth objects (NEOs) such as asteroids and comets. It is intended as a communication tool for astronomers and the public to assess the seriousness of collision predictions, by combining probability statistics and known kinetic damage potentials into a single threat value.  The Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale is a similar, but more complex scale. OverviewThe Torino Scale uses an integer scale from 0 to 10.  A 0 indicates an object has a negligibly small chance of collision with the Earth, compared with the usual "background noise" of collision events, or is too small to penetrate Earth's atmosphere intact. 

Terabyte<====>30657<====>Terabyte The terabyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information.  The prefix tera represents the fourth power of 1000, and means 10 12  in the International System of Units (SI), and therefore one terabyte is one trillion (short scale) bytes.  The unit symbol for the terabyte is TB. Definition1 TB =   =   =  . A related unit, the tebibyte (TiB), using a binary prefix, is equal to 1024 4  bytes.  One terabyte is about 0. 9095 TiB.  Despite the introduction of these standardized binary prefixes, the terabyte is still also commonly used in some computer operating systems, primarily Microsoft Windows, to denote   (1024 4  or 2 40 ) bytes for disk drive capacity. 

TWA Flight 800<====>30658<====>TWA Flight 800   Trans World Airlines Flight 800 (TWA 800) was a Boeing 747-100 that exploded and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near East Moriches, New York, on July 17, 1996, at about 8:31 p. m.  EDT, 12 minutes after takeoff from John F.  Kennedy International Airport on a scheduled international passenger flight to Rome, with a stopover in Paris. All 230 people on board perished in the third-deadliest aviation accident in U. S.  territory. Accident investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) traveled to the scene, arriving the following morning   amid speculation that a terrorist attack was the cause of the crash. 

Triangulum<====>30659<====>Triangulum   Triangulum is a small constellation in the northern sky.  Its name is Latin for "triangle", derived from its three brightest stars, which form a long and narrow triangle.  Known to the ancient Babylonians and Greeks, Triangulum was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy.  The celestial cartographers Johann Bayer and John Flamsteed catalogued the constellation's stars, giving six of them Bayer designations. The white stars Beta and Gamma Trianguli, of apparent magnitudes 3. 00 and 4. 00, respectively, form the base of the triangle and the yellow-white Alpha Trianguli, of magnitude 3. 

Tucana<====>30660<====>Tucana   Tucana is a constellation of stars in the southern sky, named after the toucan, a South American bird.  It is one of twelve constellations conceived in the late sixteenth century by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman.  Tucana first appeared on a   celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius and Jodocus Hondius and was depicted in Johann Bayer's star atlas Uranometria of 1603.  French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille gave its stars Bayer designations in 1756.  The constellations Tucana, Grus, Phoenix and Pavo are collectively known as the "Southern Birds". 

Triangulum Australe<====>30662<====>Triangulum Australe Triangulum Australe is a small constellation in the far Southern Celestial Hemisphere.  Its name is Latin for "the southern triangle", which distinguishes it from Triangulum in the northern sky and is derived from the almost equilateral pattern of its three brightest stars.  It was first depicted on a celestial globe as Triangulus Antarcticus by Petrus Plancius in 1589, and later with more accuracy and its current name by Johann Bayer in his 1603 Uranometria.  The French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille charted and gave the brighter stars their Bayer designations in 1756. Alpha Trianguli Australis, known as Atria, is a second-magnitude orange giant and the brightest star in the constellation, as well as the 42nd-brightest star in the night sky. 

Telescopium<====>30664<====>Telescopium    Telescopium is a minor constellation in the southern celestial hemisphere, one of twelve named in the 18th century by French astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille and one of several depicting scientific instruments.  Its name is a Latinized form of the Greek word for telescope.  Telescopium was later much reduced in size by Francis Baily and Benjamin Gould. The brightest star in the constellation is Alpha Telescopii, a blue-white subgiant with an apparent magnitude of 3. 5, followed by the orange giant star Zeta Telescopii at magnitude 4. 1.  Eta and PZ Telescopii are two young star systems with debris disks and brown dwarf companions. 

Trivium<====>30666<====>Trivium  The trivium is the lower division of the seven liberal arts and comprises grammar, logic, and rhetoric (input, process, and output).    The trivium is implicit in De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii ("On the Marriage of Philology and Mercury") by Martianus Capella, but the term was not used until the Carolingian Renaissance, when it was coined in imitation of the earlier quadrivium.   Grammar, logic, and rhetoric were essential to a classical education, as explained in Plato's dialogues.  The three subjects together were denoted by the word trivium during the Middle Ages, but the tradition of first learning those three subjects was established in ancient Greece. 

Last Supper<====>30667<====>Last Supper The Last Supper is the final meal that, in the Gospel accounts, Jesus shared with his Apostles in Jerusalem before his crucifixion.   The Last Supper is commemorated by Christians especially on Maundy Thursday.   The Last Supper provides the scriptural basis for the Eucharist, also known as "Holy Communion" or "The Lord's Supper".  The First Epistle to the Corinthians contains the earliest known mention of the Last Supper.  The four canonical Gospels all state that the Last Supper took place towards the end of the week, after Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem and that Jesus and his Apostles shared a meal shortly before Jesus was crucified at the end of that week. 

Tunguska event<====>30669<====>Tunguska event  The Tunguska event was a large explosion that occurred near the Stony Tunguska River in Yeniseysk Governorate (now Krasnoyarsk Krai), Russia, on the morning of 30 June 1908 (N. S. ). The explosion over the sparsely populated Eastern Siberian Taiga flattened   of forest yet caused no known human casualties.  The explosion is generally attributed to the air burst of a meteoroid.  It is classified as an impact event, even though no impact crater has been found; the object is thought to have disintegrated at an altitude of   rather than to have  hit the surface of the earth. 

The Terrorist (1997 film)<====>30674<====>The Terrorist (1997 film)    The Terrorist ( ) is an Indian Tamil film directed by Santosh Sivan.

Krishna and Sonu Sisupal.  Released in 1998, the film was shot in 15 days, with natural lighting, on a budget of $50,000.   The film won a number of awards at international film festivals.  Actor John Malkovich first saw the film at the 1998 Cairo International Film Festival and subsequently adopted the film as a kind of post-facto executive producer (the reissued film's titles read "John Malkovich Presents"). 

Tool<====>30677<====>Tool  A tool is any physical item that can be used to achieve a goal, especially if the item is not consumed in the process.   Tools that are used in particular fields or activities may have different designations such as "instrument", "utensil", "implement", "machine", "device," or "apparatus".  The set of tools needed to achieve a goal is "equipment".  The knowledge of constructing, obtaining and using tools is technology. Some animals are known to employ simple tools.  The use of stone tools by humans dates back millions of years.  More advanced tools, such as the bow and arrow began to be developed approximately 10000 years ago.

Fans are generally encouraged to sing along, and at some ballparks, the words "home team" are replaced with the team name. History of the songJack Norworth, while riding a subway train, was inspired by a sign that said "Baseball Today – Polo Grounds". 

Tai chi<====>30690<====>Tai chiTai chi (taiji), short for t'ai chi ch'üan (taijiquan; 太极拳), is an internal Chinese martial art practiced for both its defense training and its health benefits.  The term taiji refers to a philosophy of the forces of yin and yang, related to the moves.  Though originally conceived as a martial art, it is also typically practiced for a variety of other personal reasons: competitive wrestling in the format of pushing hands (tui shou), demonstration competitions, and achieving greater longevity.  As a result, a multitude of training forms exist, both traditional and modern, which correspond to those aims with differing emphasis.

Green Party of the United States<====>30696<====>Green Party of the United States  The Green Party of the United States (GPUS or Greens) is a green political party in the United States.  The party, which is the country's fourth-largest by membership, promotes environmentalism, nonviolence, social justice, participatory, grassroots democracy, gender equality, LGBT rights, anti-war, and anti-racism.  On the political spectrum the party is generally seen as left-wing.  The GPUS was founded in 2001 as the evolution of the Association of State Green Parties (ASGP), which was formed in 1996.   After its founding, the GPUS soon became the primary national green organization in the country, eclipsing the Greens/Green Party USA (G/GPUSA), which formed in 1991 out of the Green Committees of Correspondence (CoC), a collection of local green groups active since 1984. 

Triple jump<====>30697<====>Triple jump  The triple jump, sometimes referred to as the hop, step and jump or the hop, skip and jump, is a track and field event, similar to the long jump.   As a group, the two events are referred to as the "horizontal jumps. "  The competitor runs down the track and performs a hop, a bound and then a jump into the sand pit.  The triple jump was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games and has been a modern Olympics event since the Games' inception in 1896. According to IAAF rules, "the hop shall be made so that an athlete lands first on the same footas that from which he has taken off; in the step he shall land on theother foot, from which, subsequently, the jump is performed. 

TNT<====>30698<====>TNT  Trinitrotoluene ( ;   TNT), or more specifically 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, is a chemical compound with the formula C 6 H 2 (NO 2 ) 3 CH 3 .   This yellow solid is sometimes used as a reagent in chemical synthesis, but it is best known as an explosive material with convenient handling properties.   The explosive yield of TNT is considered to be the standard measure of bombs and other explosives.  In chemistry, TNT is used to generate charge transfer salts. HistoryTNT was first prepared in 1863 by German chemist Julius Wilbrand  and originally used as a yellow dye. 

Toluene<====>30699<====>Toluene Toluene  , also known as toluol  , is an aromatic hydrocarbon.   It is a colorless, water-insoluble liquid with the smell associated with paint thinners.  It is a mono-substituted benzene derivative, consisting of a CH 3  group attached to a phenyl group.  As such, its IUPAC systematic name is methylbenzene.  Toluene is predominantly used as an industrial feedstock and a solvent. As the solvent in some types of paint thinner, contact cement and model airplane glue, toluene is sometimes used as a recreational inhalant  and has the potential of causing severe neurological harm. 

The Computer Contradictionary<====>30701<====>The Computer Contradictionary The Computer Contradictionary is a non-fiction book by Stan Kelly-Bootle that compiles a satirical list of definitions of computer industry terms.   It is an example of "cynical lexicography" in the tradition of Ambrose Bierce's The Devil's Dictionary.    Rather than offering a factual account of usage, its definitions are largely made up by the author.  The book was published in May 1995 by MIT Press and is an update of Kelly-Bootle's The Devil's DP Dictionary which appeared in 1981.  ExamplesEndless loop.   See:  Loop, endlessLoop, endless.

The Great Divorce<====>30706<====>The Great Divorce The Great Divorce is a theological dream vision by C.  S.  Lewis, in which he reflects on the Christian conceptions of Heaven and Hell. The working title was Who Goes Home? but the final name was changed at the publisher's insistence.  The title refers to William Blake's poem The Marriage of Heaven and Hell.  The Great Divorce was first printed as a serial in an Anglican newspaper called The Guardian in 1944 and 1945, and soon thereafter in book form. SourcesLewis's diverse sources for this work include the works of St.  Augustine, Dante Aligheri, John Milton, John Bunyan, Emanuel Swedenborg and Lewis Carroll, as well as an American science fiction author whose name Lewis had forgotten but whom he mentions in his preface (  ). 

Temporomandibular joint dysfunction<====>30707<====>Temporomandibular joint dysfunction   Temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD, TMJD) is an umbrella term covering pain and dysfunction of the muscles of mastication (the muscles that move the jaw) and the temporomandibular joints (the joints which connect the mandible to the skull).  The most important feature is pain, followed by restricted mandibular movement,  and noises from the temporomandibular joints (TMJ) during jaw movement.  Although TMD is not life-threatening, it can be detrimental to quality of life,    because the symptoms can become chronic and difficult to manage.  TMD is a symptom complex rather than a single condition, and it is thought to be caused by multiple factors. 

The Screwtape Letters<====>30709<====>The Screwtape Letters The Screwtape Letters is a Christian apologetic novel by C.  S.  Lewis.  It is written in a satirical, epistolary style and while it is fictional in format, the plot and characters are used to address Christian theological issues, primarily those to do with temptation and resistance to it.

The uncle's mentorship pertains to the nephew's responsibility in securing the damnation of a British man known only as "the Patient". 

Tree of life<====>30710<====>Tree of life   The concept of a tree of life is a widespread mytheme or archetype in the world's mythologies, related to the concept of sacred tree more generally, Giovino, Mariana (2007).  The Assyrian Sacred Tree: A History of Interpretations, page 129.  Saint-Paul.and hence in religious and philosophical tradition. The expression Tree of Life was used as a metaphor for the phylogenetic tree of common descent in the evolutionary sense in a famous passage by Charles Darwin (1872).  The tree of knowledge, connecting to heaven and the underworld, and the tree of life, connecting all forms of creation, are both forms of the world tree or cosmic tree, according to the Encyclopædia Britannica,  and are portrayed in various religions and philosophies as the same tree.

Tide<====>30718<====>Tide   Tides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the combined effects of the gravitational forces exerted by the Moon and the Sun and the rotation of Earth. The times and amplitude of tides at any given locale are influenced by the alignment of the Sun and Moon, by the pattern of tides in the deep ocean, by the amphidromic systems of the oceans, and the shape of the coastline and near-shore bathymetry (see Timing).  Some shorelines experience a semi-diurnal tide—two nearly equal high and low tides each day.  Other locations experience a diurnal tide—only one high and low tide each day. 

Tidal force<====>30719<====>Tidal forceThe tidal force is an apparent force that stretches a body towards the center of mass of another body due to a gradient (difference in strength) in gravitational field from the other body; it is responsible for the diverse phenomena, including tides, tidal locking, breaking apart of celestial bodies and formation of ring systems within Roche limit, and in extreme cases, spaghettification of objects.  It arises because the gravitational force exerted on one body by another is not constant across its parts: the nearest side is attracted more strongly than the farthest side.  It is this difference that causes a body to get stretched. 

Theremin<====>30722<====>Theremin   The theremin ( ;  originally known as the ætherphone/etherphone, thereminophone  or termenvox/thereminvox) is an electronic musical instrument controlled without physical contact by the thereminist (performer).   It is named after the Westernized name of its Soviet inventor, Léon Theremin (Термéн), who patented the device in 1928. The instrument's controlling section usually consists of two metal antennas that sense the relative position of the thereminist's hands and control oscillators for frequency with one hand, and amplitude (volume) with the other.  The electric signals from the theremin are amplified and sent to a loudspeaker. The theremin was used in movie soundtracks such as Miklós Rózsa's Spellbound, The Lost Weekend, and Bernard Herrmann's The Day the Earth Stood Still. 

Thin client<====>30725<====>Thin client A thin client is a lightweight computer that has been optimized for remoting into a server-based computing environment.  The server does most of the work, which can include launching software programs, crunching numbers, and storing data.  In contrast, a conventional desktop PC (fat client) typically performs the same tasks locally, but can also remote into a server-based environment if/when needed. Thin clients occur as components of a broader computing infrastructure, where many clients share their computations with a server or server farm.   The server-side infrastructure makes use of cloud computing software such as application virtualization, hosted shared desktop (HSD) or desktop virtualization (VDI).

Teleological argument<====>30731<====>Teleological argument  The teleological or physico-theological argument, also known as the argument from design, or intelligent design argument is an argument for the existence of God or, more generally, for an intelligent creator based on perceived evidence of deliberate design in the natural world.It is an argument in  natural theology. The earliest recorded versions of this argument are associated with Socrates in ancient Greece, although it has been argued that he was taking up an older argument.

Tram<====>30733<====>Tram    A tram (also tramcar; and in North America streetcar, trolley, trolley car, or cable car) is a rail vehicle which runs on tracks along public urban streets, and also sometimes on a segregated right of way.   The lines or networks operated by tramcars are called tramways.  Tramways powered by electricity, the most common type historically, were once called electric street railways (mainly in the United States) due to their being widely used in urban areas before the universal adoption of electrification. Tram lines may also run between cities and towns (for example, interurbans, tram-train) or even countries (Basel, Strasbourg), or be partially grade-separated even in the cities (light rail). 

The Book of the Law<====>30736<====>The Book of the LawLiber AL vel Legis ( )  is the central sacred text of Thelema, allegedly written down from dictation mostly by Aleister Crowley, although his wife Rose Edith Crowley is also known to have written two phrases into the manuscript of the Book after its dictation.  Crowley claimed it was dictated to him by a discarnate entity named Aiwass.  However, the three chapters are largely written in the first person by the Thelemic deities Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit respectively, rather than by Aiwass/Aiwaz. Through the reception of the Book, Crowley proclaimed the arrival of a new stage in the spiritual evolution of humanity, to be known as the "Æon of Horus". 

Classical unities<====>30740<====>Classical unitiesThe classical unities, Aristotelian unities, or three unities are rules for drama derived from a passage in Aristotle's Poetics.  In their neoclassical form they are as follows:unity of action: a play should have one action that it follows, with minimal subplots. unity of time: the action in a play should occur over a period of no more than 24 hours. unity of place: a play should exist in a single physical space and should not attempt to compress geography, nor should the stage represent more than one place. Aristotle's unitiesAristotle dealt with the unity of action in some detail, under the general subject of "definition of tragedy", where he wrote: "serious, complete in itself and of a certain magnitude". 

Tlaloc<====>30741<====>TlalocFor the fictional character from the Legends of Dune books, see Titan (Dune). Tlaloc ( )  was a member of the pantheon of gods in Aztec religion.  As supreme god of the rain, Tlaloc was also a god of earthly fertility and of water.   He was widely worshipped as a beneficent giver of life and sustenance.  However, he was also feared for his ability to send hail, thunder, and lightning, and for being the lord of the powerful element of water.  Tlaloc is also associated with caves, springs, and mountains, most specifically the sacred mountain in which he was believed to reside. 

Titius–Bode law<====>30745<====>Titius–Bode lawThe Titius–Bode law (sometimes termed just Bode's law) is a hypothesis that the bodies in some orbital systems, including the Sun's, orbit at semi-major axes in a function of planetary sequence.  The formula suggests that, extending outward, each planet would be approximately twice as far from the Sun as the one before.  The hypothesis correctly anticipated the orbits of Ceres (in the asteroid belt) and Uranus, but failed as a predictor of Neptune's orbit and has eventually been superseded as a theory of solar system formation.  It is named for Johann Daniel Titius and Johann Elert Bode. 

Theory<====>30746<====>Theory  A theory is a contemplative and rational type of abstract or generalizing thinking, or the results of such thinking.   Depending on the context, the results might, for example, include generalized explanations of how nature works.  The word has its roots in ancient Greek, but in modern use it has taken on several related meanings. Theories guide the enterprise of finding facts rather than of reaching goals, and are neutral concerning alternatives among values.    A theory can be a body of knowledge, which may or may not be associated with particular explanatory models. 

TRS-80<====>30747<====>TRS-80  The TRS-80 Micro Computer System (TRS-80; later known as the Model I to distinguish it from successors) is a desktop microcomputer launched in 1977 and sold by Tandy Corporation through their Radio Shack stores.  The name is an abbreviation of Tandy/Radio Shack, Z-80 microprocessor.It was one of the earliest mass-produced and mass-marketed retail personal computers.  Notable features of the TRS-80 included its full-stroke QWERTY keyboard, its new Zilog Z80 processor (rather than the more common Intel 8080), 4K RAM standard memory (many 8-bit computers then shipped with only 1K RAM), small size and desk footprint, its floating-point BASIC programming language, an included 64 column video monitor, and a starting price of US$600    (equivalent to US$  in 2017). 

The Balloon-Hoax<====>30755<====>The Balloon-Hoax "The Balloon-Hoax" is the title used in collections and anthologies of a newspaper article written by Edgar Allan Poe, first published in 1844.  Originally presented as a true story, it detailed European Monck Mason's trip across the Atlantic Ocean in only three days in a gas balloon.  It was later revealed as a hoax and the story was retracted two days later. OverviewThe story now known as "The Balloon-Hoax" was first printed in The Sun newspaper in New York.  The article provided a detailed and highly plausible account  of a lighter-than-air balloon trip by famous European balloonist Monck Mason across the Atlantic Ocean taking 75 hours, along with a diagram and specifications of the craft. 

Terence<====>30756<====>Terence Publius Terentius Afer ( ; c.  195/185 – c.  159? BC), better known in English as Terence ( ), was a Roman playwright during the Roman Republic, of Berber descent.  His comedies were performed for the first time around 170–160 BC.  Terentius Lucanus, a Roman senator, brought Terence to Rome as a slave, educated him and later on, impressed by his abilities, freed him.  Terence apparently died young, probably in Greece or on his way back to Rome.  All of the six plays Terence wrote have survived. One famous quotation by Terence reads: "Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto", or "I am human, and I think nothing of which is human is alien to me. 

The Pit and the Pendulum<====>30757<====>The Pit and the Pendulum  "The Pit and the Pendulum" is a short story written by Edgar Allan Poe and first published in 1842 in the literary annual The Gift: A Christmas and New Year's Present for 1843.   The story is about the torments endured by a prisoner of the Spanish Inquisition, though Poe skews historical facts.  The narrator of the story describes his experience of being tortured.  The story is especially effective at inspiring fear in the reader because of its heavy focus on the senses, such as sound, emphasizing its reality, unlike many of Poe's stories which are aided by the supernatural. 

Age of Enlightenment<====>30758<====>Age of Enlightenment   The Enlightenment (also known as the Age of Enlightenment or the Age of Reason;  in  ; and in  , "Enlightenment")  was an intellectual and philosophical movement that dominated the world of ideas in Europe during the 18th century, "The Century of Philosophy".  The Enlightenment included a range of ideas centered on reason as the primary source of authority and legitimacy, and came to advance ideals like liberty, progress, tolerance, fraternity, constitutional government and separation of church and state.    In France the central doctrines of the Enlightenment philosophers were individual liberty and religious tolerance, in opposition to an absolute monarchy and the fixed dogmas of the Roman Catholic Church. 

The Hunt for Red October<====>30761<====>The Hunt for Red October  The Hunt for Red October is Tom Clancy's 1984 debut novel.  The story follows a CIA analyst who leads a group of US Navy officers to take possession of a cutting-edge Soviet nuclear submarine from 26 defecting Soviet officers, and the intertwined adventures of Soviet submarine captain Marko Aleksandrovich Ramius and Jack Ryan, a Marine turned CIA analyst.  It was loosely inspired by the mutiny on the Soviet frigate Storozhevoy in 1975.  The novel was originally published by the U. S.  Naval Institute Press—the first fictional work it ever published, and still its most successful. 

The Cardinal of the Kremlin<====>30762<====>The Cardinal of the Kremlin   The Cardinal of the Kremlin is a novel by Tom Clancy, featuring his character Jack Ryan.  It is a sequel to The Hunt for Red October, based on the development of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) and its Soviet equivalent, covering themes including intelligence gathering and counterintelligence, political intrigue, and guerrilla warfare in Afghanistan. The SDI (Strategic Defense Initiative) systems discussed in the book are based on real-world systems.   In the book, satellite photos are shown of the Dushanbe Complex called "Bright Star" in the novel.   These images are of an actual contemporary Soviet mountaintop site of then-disputed function called Okno. 

Debt of Honor<====>30763<====>Debt of Honor  Debt of Honor (1994) is a thriller novel by Tom Clancy.  It is a continuation of the series featuring his character Jack Ryan.  In this installment, Ryan has become the National Security Advisor when the Japanese government (controlled by a group of corporate tycoons known as the Zaibatsu) goes to war with the United States.

The Troubles<====>30770<====>The Troubles The Troubles ( )  was an ethno-nationalist  conflict in Northern Ireland during the late 20th century.  Also known internationally as the Northern Ireland conflict, A Glossary of Terms Related to the Conflict.  Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN).  Quote: "The term 'the Troubles' is a euphemism used by people in Ireland for the present conflict.  The term has been used before to describe other periods of Irish history.  On the CAIN web site the terms 'Northern Ireland conflict' and 'the Troubles', are used interchangeably. 

Theoretical ecology<====>30773<====>Theoretical ecologyTheoretical ecology is the scientific discipline devoted to the study of ecological systems using theoretical methods such as simple conceptual models, mathematical models, computational simulations, and advanced data analysis.  Effective models improve understanding of the natural world by revealing how the dynamics of species populations are often based on fundamental biological conditions and processes.  Further, the field aims to unify a diverse range of empirical observations by assuming that common, mechanistic processes generate observable phenomena across species and ecological environments.  Based on biologically realistic assumptions, theoretical ecologists are able to uncover novel, non-intuitive insights about natural processes. 

Thomas Nast<====>30775<====>Thomas Nast Thomas Nast ( ;  ; September 27, 1840 – December 7, 1902) was a German-born American caricaturist and editorial cartoonist considered to be the "Father of the American Cartoon".   He was the scourge of Democratic Representative "Boss" Tweed and the Tammany Hall Democratic party political machine.  Among his notable works were the creation of the modern version of Santa Claus (based on the traditional German figures of Sankt Nikolaus and Weihnachtsmann) and the political symbol of the elephant for the Republican Party (GOP).  Contrary to popular belief, Nast did not create Uncle Sam (the male personification of the American people), Columbia (the female personification of American values), or the Democratic donkey,  though he did popularize these symbols through his artwork. 

Teutonic Order<====>30776<====>Teutonic Order  The Order of Brothers of the German House of Saint Mary in Jerusalem  (official names:  ,  ), commonly the Teutonic Order ( ,   or  ), is a Catholic religious order founded as a military order c.  1190 in Acre, Kingdom of Jerusalem. The Teutonic Order was formed to aid Christians on their pilgrimages to the Holy Land and to establish hospitals.  Its members have commonly been known as the Teutonic Knights, having a small voluntary and mercenary military membership, serving as a crusading military order for protection of Christians in the Holy Land and the Baltics during the Middle Ages. 

Universe of The Legend of Zelda<====>30778<====>Universe of The Legend of Zelda  The universe depicted in The Legend of Zelda series of video games consists of a variety of lands, the most predominant of these being    , and was created by Japanese video game developer Shigeru Miyamoto.  Hyrule The kingdom of  , a medieval-inspired fantasy land, serves as the main setting of the series.  Making its first appearance in The Legend of Zelda, many of the designated areas in Hyrule have recurring appearances throughout the series, such as the Lost Woods, Kakariko Village, Death Mountain and Lake Hylia.  Several games in the series are set in lands other than Hyrule, including Link's Awakening, set on Koholint Island; Majora's Mask, set in Termina; Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages, set in Holodrum and Labrynna, respectively; The Wind Waker and Phantom Hourglass, both set on the Great Sea, a flooded Hyrule (although a large portion of Phantom Hourglass takes place in the World of the Ocean King, which is in another dimension); Spirit Tracks, in New Hyrule and Skyward Sword, set on Skyloft, a group of islands floating above the clouds. 

Traducianism<====>30780<====>Traducianism In Christian theology, traducianism is a doctrine about the origin of the soul (or synonymously, "spirit"), holding that this immaterial aspect is transmitted through natural generation along with the body, the material aspect of human beings.  That is, an individual's soul is derived from the souls of the individual's parents.    This implies that only the soul of Adam was created directly by God (with Eve's substance, material and immaterial, being taken from out of Adam), in contrast with the idea of creationism of soul (not to be confused with creationism as a belief about the origin of the material universe), which holds that all souls are created directly by God (with Eve's substance, material and immaterial, being taken from out of Adam). 

Tulsa race riot<====>30785<====>Tulsa race riot  The Tulsa race riot, or Tulsa race riot of 1921, occurred between May 31 and June 1, 1921, when a white mob started attacking residents and businesses of the African-American community of Greenwood in Tulsa, Oklahoma,  in what is considered one of the worst incidents of racial violence in the history of the United States.  Scott Ellsworth, "Tulsa Race Riot", The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture, 2009; accessed 31 December 2016  The attack, carried out on the ground and by air, destroyed more than 35 blocks of the district, at the time the wealthiest black community in the nation. 

Tuatara<====>30786<====>Tuatara   Tuatara are reptiles endemic to New Zealand.  Although resembling most lizards, they are part of a distinct lineage, the order Rhynchocephalia.Their name derives from the Māori language, and means "peaks on the back".The single species of tuatara is the only surviving member of its order, which flourished around 200 million years ago.Their most recent common ancestor with any other extant group is with the squamates (lizards and snakes).   For this reason, tuatara are of great interest in the study of the evolution of lizards and snakes, and for the reconstruction of the appearance and habits of the earliest diapsids, a group of amniote tetrapods that also includes dinosaurs, birds, and crocodilians. 

Polytetrafluoroethylene<====>30791<====>Polytetrafluoroethylene  {{chembox }}Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is a synthetic fluoropolymer of tetrafluoroethylene that has numerous applications.  The best known brand name of PTFE-based formulas is Teflon by Chemours.Chemours is a  2015 spin-off of DuPont Co. ,  which discovered the compound in 1938.  PTFE is a fluorocarbon solid, as it is a high-molecular-weight compound consisting wholly of carbon and fluorine.  PTFE is hydrophobic: neither water nor water-containing substances wet PTFE, as fluorocarbons demonstrate mitigated London dispersion forces due to the high electronegativity of fluorine.  PTFE has one of the lowest coefficients of friction of any solid. 

Thomas Paine<====>30795<====>Thomas Paine    Thomas Paine (or Pain ;   – In the contemporary record as noted by Conway, Paine's birth date is given as January 29, 1736–37.  Common practice was to use a dash or a slash to separate the old-style year from the new-style year.  In the old calendar, the new year began on March 25, not January 1.  Paine's birth date, therefore, would have been before New Year, 1737.  In the new style, his birth date advances by eleven days and his year increases by one to February 9, 1737. 

Tyre, Lebanon<====>30796<====>Tyre, Lebanon  Tyre ( , Ṣūr; Phoenician:  , Ṣur;  , Tsor; Tiberian Hebrew  , Ṣōr; Akkadian:  , Ṣurru; Greek: Τύρος, Týros;  ;  ,  , Tir), sometimes romanized as Sour, is a district capital in the South Governorate of Lebanon.  There were approximately 117,000 inhabitants in 2003.   However, the government of Lebanon has released only rough estimates of population numbers since 1932, so an accurate statistical accounting is not possible.    Tyre juts out from the coast of the Mediterranean and is located about   south of Beirut. 

Tarja Halonen<====>30797<====>Tarja Halonen  Tarja Kaarina Halonen ( ; born 24 December 1943) is a Finnish politician who served as the 11th, and first female, President of Finland from 2000 to 2012.  She first rose to prominence as a lawyer with the Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK), and as the Prime Minister's parliamentary secretary (1974-1975) and a member of the City Council of Helsinki (1977-1996).  Halonen was a Social Democratic Party member of parliament from 1979 until her election to the presidency in 2000.   She also served as Minister at the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health from 1987 to 1990, Minister of Justice from 1990 to 1991, and as Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1995 until her election as president. 

Truso<====>30801<====>Truso  Truso, situated on Lake Drużno, was an Old Prussian (Pomesanian) town near the Baltic Sea just east of the Vistula River.  It was one of the trading posts on the Amber Road, and is thought to be the antecedent of the city of Elbląg (Elbing).  In the words of Marija Gimbutas, "the name of the town is the earliest known historically in the Baltic Sea area".  Gimbutas M.  The Balts.  London: Thames and Hudson, 1963.   The main export goods of Truso were amber, furs, and slaves, while blacksmithing and amber working were the major industries. 

Tragedy of the commons<====>30802<====>Tragedy of the commonsThe tragedy of the commons is an economic theory of a situation within a shared-resource system where individual users acting independently according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling that resource through their collective action.  The concept and name originate in an essay written in 1833 by the Victorian economist William Forster Lloyd, who used a hypothetical example of the effects of unregulated grazing on common land (then colloquially called "the commons") in the British Isles.The concept became widely known over a century later due to an article written by the ecologist Garrett Hardin in 1968. 

Tape bias<====>30805<====>Tape biasTape bias is the term for two techniques, AC bias and DC bias, that improve the fidelity of analogue tape recorders.   DC bias is the addition of a direct current to the audio signal that is being recorded.   AC bias is the addition of an inaudible high-frequency signal (generally from 40 to 150 kHz) to the audio signal.  Most contemporary tape recorders use AC bias. Without bias, when recording, magnetic tape  has a nonlinear response at low signal strengths, as measured by its coercivity.  A signal which generates a magnetic field strength less than tape's coercivity is unable to magnetise the tape and produces little signal. 

Tree (data structure)<====>30806<====>Tree (data structure)  In computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract data type (ADT)—or data structure implementing this ADT—that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes. A tree data structure can be defined recursively (locally) as a collection of nodes (starting at a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a value, together with a list of references to nodes (the "children"), with the constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root. 

Tangent space<====>30807<====>Tangent spaceIn mathematics, the tangent space of a manifold facilitates the generalization of vectors from affine spaces to general manifolds, since in the latter case, one cannot simply subtract two points to obtain a vector that gives the displacement of the one point from the other. Informal descriptionIn differential geometry, one can attach to every point   x   of a differentiable manifold a tangent space—a real vector space that intuitively contains the possible directions in which one can tangentially pass through   x  .  The elements of the tangent space at   x   are called the tangent vectors at   x  . 

Tao<====>30808<====>Tao   Tao or Dao ( ,  ;  from   ,  ) is a Chinese word signifying 'way', 'path', 'route', 'road', 'choose', 'key' or sometimes more loosely 'doctrine',  'principle' or 'holistic science'  Dr Zai, J.  Taoism and Science: Cosmology, Evolution, Morality, Health and more.  Ultravisum, 2015.   .  Within the context of traditional Chinese philosophy and religion, the Tao is the intuitive knowing of "life" that cannot be grasped full-heartedly as just a concept but is known nonetheless through actual living experience of one's everyday being.  Laozi in the Tao Te Ching explains that the Tao is not a 'name' for a 'thing' but the underlying natural order of the Universe whose ultimate essence is difficult to circumscribe due to it being non conceptual yet evident' in one's being of aliveness. 

The Thing (1982 film)<====>30809<====>The Thing (1982 film)    The Thing (also known as John Carpenter's The Thing) is a 1982 American science-fiction horror film directed by John Carpenter, written by Bill Lancaster, and starring Kurt Russell.  The film's title refers to its primary antagonist: a parasitic extraterrestrial lifeform that assimilates other organisms and in turn imitates them.  The Thing infiltrates an Antarctic research station, taking the appearance of the researchers that it absorbs, and paranoia develops within the group. The film is based on John W.  Campbell, Jr. 's novella Who Goes There?, which was more loosely adapted by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby as the 1951 film The Thing from Another World. 

Troff<====>30811<====>Troff   troff   is the major component of a document processing system developed by AT&T Corporation for the Unix operating system. troff features commands to designate fonts, spacing, paragraphs, margins, footnotes and more.  Unlike many other text formatters, troff can position characters arbitrarily on a page, even overlapping them, and has a fully programmable input language.  Separate preprocessors are used for more convenient production of tables, diagrams, and mathematics.   Inputs to troff are plain text files that can be created by any text editor. Extensive macro packages have been created for various document styles. 

The Onion<====>30813<====>The Onion    The Onion is an American digital media company and news satire organization that publishes articles on international, national, and local news.  Based in Chicago, the company originated as a weekly print publication on August 29, 1988 in Madison, Wisconsin.In the spring of 1996, The Onion began publishing online.  In 2007, the organization began publishing satirical news audio and video online, as the Onion News Network.  In 2013, The Onion ceased publishing its print edition and launched Onion Labs, an advertising agency.  The Onion s articles cover current events, both real and fictional, satirizing the tone and format of traditional news organizations with stories, editorials, op-ed pieces, and man-in-the-street interviews using a traditional news website layout and an editorial voice modeled after that of the Associated Press. 

Taoiseach<====>30814<====>TaoiseachThe Taoiseach ( ,  pl.  Taoisigh  ;  ) is the prime minister, chief executive and head of government of Ireland.  The Taoiseach is appointed by the President upon the nomination of Dáil Éireann, the lower house of the Oireachtas (parliament), and must, in order to remain in office, retain the support of a majority in the Dáil.  The word   means "chieftain" or "leader" in Irish and was adopted in the 1937 Constitution of Ireland as the title of the "head of the Government, or Prime Minister".   Taoiseach is the official title of the head of government in both English and Irish. 

Tree rotation<====>30816<====>Tree rotationIn discrete mathematics, tree rotation is an operation on a binary tree that changes the structure without interfering with the order of the elements.  A tree rotation moves one node up in the tree and one node down.  It is used to change the shape of the tree, and in particular to decrease its height by moving smaller subtrees down and larger subtrees up, resulting in improved performance of many tree operations. There exists an inconsistency in different descriptions as to the definition of the direction of rotations.  Some say that the direction of rotation reflects the direction that a node is moving upon rotation (a left child rotating into its parent's location is a right rotation) while others say that the direction of rotation reflects which subtree is rotating (a left subtree rotating into its parent's location is a left rotation, the opposite of the former). 

The New York Times Company<====>30830<====>The New York Times Company    The New York Times Company is an American media company which publishes its namesake, The New York Times.  A. G.

The Buccaneers currently compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member team of the National Football Conference (NFC) South division.  Along with the Seattle Seahawks, the team joined the NFL in   as an expansion team.  The Bucs played their first season in the American Football Conference (AFC) West division as part of the 1976 expansion plan, whereby each new franchise would play every other franchise over the first two years.  After the season, the club switched conferences with the Seahawks and became a member of the NFC Central division. 

Tennessee Titans<====>30839<====>Tennessee Titans The Tennessee Titans are a professional American football team based in Nashville, Tennessee.  The Titans compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the American Football Conference (AFC) South division.  Previously known as the Houston Oilers, the team began play in 1960 in Houston, Texas, as a charter member of the American Football League (AFL).  The Oilers won the first two AFL Championships, and joined the NFL as part of the AFL–NFL merger in 1970. The team relocated from Houston to Tennessee in 1997, and played at the Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis for one season. 

Tetrarchy<====>30840<====>TetrarchyThe term tetrarchy (from the  , tetrarchia, "leadership of four [people]")  describes any form of government where power is divided among four individuals, but in modern usage usually refers to the system instituted by Roman Emperor Diocletian in 293, marking the end of the Crisis of the Third Century and the recovery of the Roman Empire.  This tetrarchy lasted until c.  313, when   conflict eliminated most of the claimants to power, leaving Constantine in control of the western half of the empire, and Licinius in control of the eastern half. 

Theism<====>30843<====>Theism  Theism is broadly defined as the belief in the existence of the Supreme Being or deities.    In popular parlance, or when contrasted with deism, the term often describes the classical conception of God that is found in monotheistic or gods found in polytheistic religions; a belief in God or in gods without the rejection of revelation as is characteristic of deism.    Atheism is commonly understood as rejection of theism in the broadest sense of theism, i. e.  the rejection of belief in God or gods.    (page 175 in 1967 edition)  The claim that the existence of any deity is unknown or unknowable is agnosticism. 

Tensor product<====>30844<====>Tensor productIn mathematics, the tensor product   of two vector spaces   and   (over the same field) is itself a vector space, together with an operation of bilinear composition, denoted by  , from ordered pairs in the Cartesian product   into  , in a way that generalizes the outer product.   The tensor product of   and   is the vector space generated by the symbols  , with   and  , in which the relations of bilinearity are imposed for the product operation  , and no other relations are assumed to hold.

Toledo, Ohio<====>30849<====>Toledo, Ohio  Toledo ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Lucas County, Ohio, United States.Toledo is in northwest Ohio, at the western end of Lake Erie bordering the state of Michigan.  The city was founded by United States citizens in 1833 on the west bank of the Maumee River, and originally incorporated as part of Monroe County, Michigan Territory.  It was re-founded in 1837, after conclusion of the Toledo War, when it was incorporated in Ohio. After the 1845 completion of the Miami and Erie Canal, Toledo grew quickly; it also benefited from its position on the railway line between New York City and Chicago. 

Toledo War<====>30850<====>Toledo War The Toledo War (1835–36), also known as the Michigan–Ohio War, was an almost bloodless boundary dispute between the U. S.  state of Ohio and the adjoining territory of Michigan.   Poor geographical understanding of the Great Lakes helped produce conflicting state and federal legislation between 1787 and 1805, and varying interpretations of the laws led the governments of Ohio and Michigan to both claim jurisdiction over a   region along the border, now known as the Toledo Strip.  The situation came to a head when Michigan petitioned for statehood in 1835 and sought to include the disputed territory within its boundaries. 

Toledo Mud Hens<====>30852<====>Toledo Mud Hens The Toledo Mud Hens are a Minor League Baseball team located in Toledo, Ohio.  The Mud Hens play in the International League and are affiliated with the Detroit Tigers franchise of Major League Baseball, based about   north of Toledo.  They play their home games at Fifth Third Field. HistoryProfessional baseball had been played off and on in Toledo since 1883, but the Mud Hens era began in 1896 with the "Swamp Angels", who played in the Interstate League.  They played in Bay View Park, which was outside the Toledo city limits and therefore not covered by the city's blue laws. 

Transylvania<====>30853<====>Transylvania  Transylvania is a historical region in today's central Romania.  Bound on the east and south by its natural borders, the Carpathian mountain range, historical Transylvania extended westward to the Apuseni Mountains.  The term sometimes encompasses not only Transylvania proper, but also the historical regions of Crișana and Maramureș, and occasionally the Romanian part of Banat. The region of Transylvania is known for the scenery of its Carpathian landscape and its rich history.  It also contains major cities such as Cluj-Napoca, Brașov, Sibiu and Târgu Mureș.

Towpath<====>30855<====>Towpath  A towpath is a road or trail on the bank of a river, canal, or other inland waterway.  The purpose of a towpath is to allow a land vehicle, beasts of burden, or a team of human pullers to tow a boat, often a barge.  This mode of transport was common where sailing was impractical due to tunnels and bridges, unfavourable winds, or the narrowness of the channel. After the Industrial Revolution, towing became obsolete when engines were fitted on boats and when railway transportation superseded the slow towing method.  Since then, many of these towpaths have been converted to multi-use trails. 

Texas Rangers (baseball)<====>30857<====>Texas Rangers (baseball)  The Texas Rangers are an American professional baseball team based in Arlington, Texas, located in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex.  The Rangers franchise currently competes in Major League Baseball as a member of the American League (AL) West division.  Since  , the Rangers have played in Globe Life Park in Arlington in Arlington, Texas.  The team's name is borrowed from the famous law enforcement agency of the same name. The franchise was established in 1961 as the Washington Senators, an expansion team awarded to Washington, D. C. , after the city's first American League ballclub, the second Washington Senators, moved to Minnesota and became the Twins (the original Washington Senators played primarily in the National League during the 1890s). 

Tex-Mex<====>30859<====>Tex-Mex  Tex-Mex (from Texan and Mexican) is a fusion of Mexican and American cuisines, deriving from the culinary creations of Tejanos.  It has spread from border states such as Texas and others in the Southwestern United States to the rest of the country as well as Canada.  Tex-Mex is most popular in Texas and some parts of Mexico. Tex-Mex is often conflated with the Southwestern cuisine    found in Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah. Common dishesSome ingredients are common in Mexican cuisine, but other ingredients not typically used in Mexico are often added.  Tex-Mex cuisine is characterized by its heavy use of shredded cheese, meat (particularly beef and pork), beans, peppers and spices, in addition to flour tortillas. 

Trick-or-treating<====>30861<====>Trick-or-treating Trick-or-treating is a Halloween ritual custom for children and adults in many countries.  Children in costumes travel from house-to-house, asking for treats with the phrase "Trick or treat".  The "treat" is usually some form of candy, although, in some cultures, money is used instead.  The "trick" is a usually idle threat to perform mischief on the homeowners or their property if no treat is given.  Trick-or-treating usually occurs on the evening of October 31.  Some homeowners signal that they are willing to hand out treats by putting up Halloween decorations outside their doors; others simply leave treats available on their porches for the children to take freely. 

Test cricket<====>30863<====>Test cricket  Test cricket is the longest form of the sport of cricket and is considered its highest standard.    Test matches are played between national representative teams with "Test status", as determined and conferred by the International Cricket Council (ICC).  The two teams of 11 players play a four-innings match, which may last up to five days (or longer in some historical cases).  It is generally considered the most complete examination of teams' playing ability and endurance.The name Test stems from the long, gruelling match being both mentally and physically testing. 

Thucydides<====>30864<====>Thucydides  Thucydides ( ;  ,  ,  ;   BC) was an Athenian historian and general.  His History of the Peloponnesian War recounts the fifth-century BC war between Sparta and Athens until the year 411 BC.  Thucydides has been dubbed the father of "scientific history" by those who accept his claims to have applied strict standards of  impartiality and evidence-gathering and analysis of cause and effect, without reference to intervention by the gods, as outlined in his introduction to his work.   He also has been called the father of the school of political realism, which views the political behavior of individuals and the subsequent outcomes of relations between states as ultimately mediated by and constructed upon the emotions of fear and self-interest. 

Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)<====>30865<====>Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)    The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was a court-like restorative justice  body assembled in South Africa after the abolition of apartheid in 1994.    Witnesses who were identified as victims of gross human rights violations were invited to give statements about their experiences, and some were selected for public hearings.  Perpetrators of violence could also give testimony and request amnesty from both civil and criminal prosecution. The TRC, the first of the 1003 held internationally to stage public hearings, was seen by many as a crucial component of the transition to full and free democracy in South Africa. 

Tatting<====>30867<====>Tatting Tatting is a technique for handcrafting a particularly durable lace from a series of knots and loops.   Tatting can be used to make lace edging as well as doilies, collars, accessories such as earrings and necklaces, and other decorative pieces.   The lace is formed by a pattern of rings and chains formed from a series of cow hitch or half-hitch knots, called double stitches, over a core thread.  Gaps can be left between the stitches to form picots, which are used for practical construction as well as decorative effect. Tatting dates to the early 17th century, as evidence in a poem by Sir Charles Sedley, "The Royal Knotter", written in the late 1600s and published posthumously in 1707. 

Treaty of Lausanne<====>30868<====>Treaty of Lausanne    The Treaty of Lausanne ( ) was a peace treaty signed in Palais de Rumine,   Lausanne, Switzerland, on 24 July 1923.  It officially settled the conflict that had originally existed between the Ottoman Empire and the Allied French Republic, British Empire, Kingdom of Italy, Empire of Japan, Kingdom of Greece, and the Kingdom of Romania since the onset of World War I.The original text of the treaty is in French.   It was the result of a second attempt at peace after the failed Treaty of Sèvres, which was signed by all previous parties, except the Kingdom of Greece, but later rejected by the Turkish national movement who fought against the previous terms and significant loss of territory. 

Tesla turbine<====>30869<====>Tesla turbine The Tesla turbine is a bladeless centripetal flow turbine patented by Nikola Tesla in 1913.    It is referred to as a bladeless turbine.  The Tesla turbine is also known as the  boundary layer turbine, cohesion-type turbine, and Prandtl layer turbine (after Ludwig Prandtl) because it uses the boundary layer effect and not a fluid impinging upon the blades as in a conventional turbine.  Bioengineering researchers have referred to it as a multiple disk centrifugal pump.One of Tesla’s desires for implementation of this turbine was for geothermal power, which was described in Our Future Motive Power. 

Transport in Afghanistan<====>30870<====>Transport in AfghanistanTransport in Afghanistan is limited and in the developing stage.  Much of the nation's road network was built during the 1960s but left to ruin during the 1980s and 90's wars.  New national highways, roads, and bridges have been rebuilt in the last decade to help increase travel as well as trade with neighboring countries.  In 2008, there were about 731,607 vehicles registered inside the country. Landlocked Afghanistan has no seaports but the Amu Darya river, which forms part of the nation's border with Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan, does have large traffic.  Rebuilding of airports, roads, and rail services has led to rapid economic boost in recent years. 

The Cramps<====>30872<====>The Cramps The Cramps were an American garage punk  band, formed in 1976 and active until 2009.  The band split after the death of lead singer Lux Interior.   Their line-up rotated much over their existence, with the husband-and-wife duo of Interior and lead guitarist and occasional bass guitarist Poison Ivy comprising the only permanent members.  The addition of guitarist Bryan Gregory and drummer Pam Ballam resulted in the first complete lineup in April 1976. They were part of the early CBGB punk rock movement that had emerged in New York.  The Cramps were one of the first punk bands, and also widely recognized as one of the prime innovators of psychobilly. 

The Stems<====>30873<====>The Stems   The Stems are an alternative rock band formed in Perth, Western Australia in late 1983.  They were founded by Dom Mariani in late 1983.  The Stems are heavily influenced by 1960s garage rock and 1970s power pop.The band initially broke up in August 1987 and reformed in 2003 releasing a new album in 2007.  Although the group disbanded in October 2009, as of 2013 The Stems are an ongoing live concern. HistoryFormationThe Stems formed in late 1983 when vocalist/guitarist Dom Mariani, formerly in The Go-Starts, was introduced to Richard Lane. 

Theocracy<====>30875<====>Theocracy   Theocracy is a form of government in which a deity is the source from which all authority derives.  The Oxford English Dictionary has this definition: An ecclesiocracy is a situation where the religious leaders assume a leading role in the state, but do not claim that they are instruments of divine revelation: for example, the prince-bishops of the European Middle Ages, where the bishop was also the temporal ruler.  Such a state may use the administrative hierarchy of the religion for its own administration, or it may have two 'arms'—administrators and clergy—but with the state administrative hierarchy subordinate to the religious hierarchy. 

Tékumel<====>30877<====>Tékumel Tékumel is a fantasy world created by M.  A.  R.  Barker over the course of several decades from around 1940.In this imaginary world, huge, tradition-bound empires with medieval levels of technology vie for control using magic, large standing armies, and ancient technological devices.  In time, Barker created the role-playing game Empire of the Petal Throne, set in the Tékumel fictional universe, and first published in 1975 by TSR, Inc.  Later, Barker wrote a series of five novels set in Tékumel, beginning with The Man of Gold, first published by DAW Books in 1984. 

Chicken or the egg<====>30878<====>Chicken or the egg  The chicken or the egg causality dilemma is commonly stated as "which came first: the chicken or the egg?".  The dilemma stems from the observation that all chickens hatch from eggs and all chicken eggs are laid by chickens.  "Chicken-and-egg" is a metaphoric adjective describing situations where it is not clear which of two events should be considered the cause and which should be considered the effect, or to express a scenario of infinite regress.  Plutarch posed the question as a philosophical matter in his essay "The Symposiacs", written in the 1st century CE. 

Tuscarora people<====>30881<====>Tuscarora people  The Tuscarora (in Tuscarora Skarù:ręˀ, "hemp gatherers"  or "Shirt-Wearing People"   ) are a Native American tribe and First Nations band government of the Iroquoian-language family, with members today in North Carolina, New York, and Ontario.   They coalesced as a people around the Great Lakes, likely about the same time as the rise of the Five Nations of the historic Iroquois Confederacy, also Iroquoian-speaking and based then in present-day New York. Well before the arrival of Europeans in North America, the Tuscarora had migrated south and settled in the region now known as Eastern Carolina. 

The Center<====>30883<====>The CenterThe Center ( ) is the fifth tallest skyscraper in Hong Kong,  after International Commerce Centre, Two International Finance Centre (88 storeys), Central Plaza and Bank of China Tower.  With a height of  , it comprises 73 storeys.  The Center is one of the few skyscrapers in Hong Kong that is entirely steel-structured with no reinforced concrete core.  It is located on Queen's Road Central in the Central, roughly halfway between the MTR Island Line's Sheung Wan and Central stations. BackgroundThe Center is notable for its arrangement of hundreds of neon lights arranged as bars in increasing frequency towards the top of the building, which slowly scroll through the colours of the spectrum at night. 

Turbocharger<====>30886<====>Turbocharger   A turbocharger, or colloquially turbo, is a turbine-driven forced induction device that increases an internal combustion engine's efficiency and power output by forcing extra air into the combustion chamber.   [1]    This improvement over a naturally aspirated engine's power output is due to the fact that the compressor can force more air—and proportionately more fuel—into the combustion chamber than atmospheric pressure (and for that matter, ram air intakes) alone. Turbochargers were originally known as turbosuperchargers when all forced induction devices were classified as superchargers.  Today the term "supercharger" is typically applied only to mechanically driven forced induction devices.

Time zone<====>30890<====>Time zoneA time zone is a region of the globe that observes a uniform standard time for legal, commercial, and social purposes.  Time zones tend to follow the boundaries of countries and their subdivisions because it is convenient for areas in close commercial or other communication to keep the same time. Most of the time zones on land are offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) by a whole number of hours (UTC−12 to UTC+14), but a few zones are offset by 30 or 45 minutes (e. g.  Newfoundland Standard Time is UTC−03:30, Nepal Standard Time is UTC+05:45, and Indian Standard Time is UTC+05:30).

Treaty of Verdun<====>30898<====>Treaty of Verdun   The Treaty of Verdun, signed in August 843, was the first of the treaties that divided the Carolingian Empire into three kingdoms among the three surviving sons of Louis the Pious, who was the son of Charlemagne.  The treaty, signed in Verdun-sur-Meuse, ended the three-year Carolingian Civil War. BackgroundFollowing Charlemagne's death,  Louis was made ruler of the Carolingian empire.  During his reign, he divided the empire so that each of his sons could rule over their own kingdom under the greater rule of their father.  Lothair I was given the title of emperor but because of several re-divisions by his father and the resulting revolts, he became much less powerful. 

Trance music<====>30900<====>Trance music  Trance is a genre of electronic  music  that emerged during the early 1990s in Germany and the rest of Europe, as a more melodic offshoot from techno.   It is characterized by a tempo lying between 125 and 150 beats per minute (BPM),  repeating melodic phrases,  and a musical form that distinctly builds tension and elements throughout a track often culminating in 1 to 2 "peaks" or "drops. "  Although trance is a genre of its own, it liberally incorporates influences from other musical styles such as techno,  house,  pop,  chill-out,  classical music,   tech house, ambient, and film music.

Transformer<====>30906<====>Transformer A transformer is an electrical device that transfers electrical energy between two or more circuits through electromagnetic induction.  A varying current in one coil of the transformer produces a varying magnetic field, which in turn induces a varying electromotive force (emf) or "voltage" in a second coil.  Power can be transferred between the two coils through the magnetic field, without a metallic connection between the two circuits.  Faraday's law of induction discovered in 1831 described this effect.  Transformers are used to increase or decrease the alternating voltages in electric power applications. Since the invention of the first constant-potential transformer in 1885, transformers have become essential for the transmission, distribution, and utilization of alternating current electrical energy. 

Transubstantiation<====>30907<====>Transubstantiation Transubstantiation (Latin: transsubstantiatio; Greek: μετουσίωσις metousiosis) is, according to the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, the change of substance or essence by which the bread and wine offered in the sacrifice of the sacrament of the Eucharist during the Mass, become, in reality, the body and blood of Jesus Christ. The Roman Catholic Church teaches that in the Eucharistic offering bread and wine are changed into the body and blood of Christ.   The reaffirmation of this doctrine was expressed, using the word "transubstantiate", by the Fourth Council of the Lateran in 1215.    It was later challenged by various 15th century reformers—John Wycliffe in particular. 

Thomas Brackett Reed<====>30908<====>Thomas Brackett Reed  Thomas Brackett Reed (October 18, 1839 – December 7, 1902), occasionally ridiculed as Czar Reed, was a U. S.  Representative from Maine, and Speaker of the U. S.  House of Representatives from 1889–1891 and also from 1895–1899.  He was a powerful leader of the Republican Party, and during his tenure as Speaker of the House, he served with greater influence than any Speaker who came before, and he forever increased its power and influence for those who succeeded him in the position. Born in Portland, Maine, Reed established a legal practice in Portland after graduating from Bowdoin College. 

Thunderbird and Whale<====>30913<====>Thunderbird and Whale"Thunderbird and Whale" is an indigenous myth belonging to the mythological traditions of a number of tribes from the Pacific Northwest. SummaryWhale was a monster, killing other whales and depriving the Quileute tribe of meat and oil.  Thunderbird, a benevolent supernatural being, saw from its home high in the mountains that the people were starving. It soared out over the coastal waters, then plunged into the ocean and seized Whale. A struggle ensued; the ocean receded and rose again.   Many canoes were flung into trees and many people were killed. Thunderbird eventually succeeded in lifting Whale out of the ocean, carrying it high into the air and then dropping it. 

Tomato sauce<====>30916<====>Tomato sauce   Tomato sauce (also known as Neapolitan sauce, and referred to in Italy as Salsa di pomodoro) refers to any of a very large number of sauces made primarily from tomatoes, usually to be served as part of a dish (rather than as a condiment).  Tomato sauces are common for meat and vegetables, but they are perhaps best known as sauces for pasta dishes. Tomatoes have a rich flavor, high liquid content, very soft flesh which breaks down easily, and the right composition to thicken into a sauce when they are cooked (without the need of thickeners such as roux). 

Triage<====>30919<====>Triage Triage (  or / /) is the process of determining the priority of patients' treatments based on the severity of their condition.  This rations patient treatment efficiently when resources are insufficient for all to be treated immediately.  The term comes from the French verb trier, meaning to separate, sift or select.   Triage may result in determining the order and priority of emergency treatment, the order and priority of emergency transport, or the transport destination for the patient. Triage may also be used for patients arriving at the emergency department, or telephoning medical advice systems,  among others. 

Tolstoy family<====>30925<====>Tolstoy family Tolstoy, or Tolstoi ( ), is a prominent family of Russian nobility, descending from Andrey Kharitonovich Tolstoy ("the Fat"), who served under Vasily II of Moscow.  The "wild Tolstoys", as they were known in the high society of Imperial Russia, have left a lasting legacy in Russian politics, military history, literature, and fine arts. The Tolstoys in the Napoleonic warsTwo members of the family were active during the Napoleonic wars.  Count Pyotr Aleksandrovich Tolstoy (1761–1844) served under Suvorov in wars against Poland and Turkey, was made a general-adjutant in 1797, went as an ambassador to Paris in 1807 and tried to persuade Alexander I to prepare for the war against France, without much success though. 

Transpositional pun<====>30928<====>Transpositional punA transpositional pun is a complicated pun format with two aspects.  It involves transposing the words in a well-known phrase or saying to get a daffynition-like clever redefinition of a well-known word unrelated to the original phrase.  The redefinition is thus the first aspect, the transposition the second aspect.  As a result, transpositional puns are considered among the most difficult to create, and commonly the most challenging to comprehend, particularly for non-native speakers of the language in which they're given (most commonly English).  ExamplesPun Original reference Alimony: The bounty of mutiny.   The Mutiny on the Bounty Dieting: A waist is a terrible thing to mind. 

Tom Daschle<====>30930<====>Tom Daschle  Thomas Andrew Daschle ( ; born December 9, 1947) is a retired American politician and lobbyist who served as a United States Senator from South Dakota from 1987 to 2005.  He is a member of the Democratic Party. Daschle obtained a degree at South Dakota State University, and also served in the United States Air Force.  He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1978 and served four terms.  In 1986, he was elected to the U. S.  Senate, becoming Minority Leader in 1995 and Majority Leader in 2001.  Defeated for re-election in 2004, he took a position as a policy advisor with a lobbying firm, and also became a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. 

Throughput<====>30932<====>Throughput   In general terms, throughput is the maximum rate of production or the maximum rate at which something can be processed. When used in the context of communication networks, such as Ethernet or packet radio, throughput or network throughput is the rate of successful message delivery over a communication channel.   The data these messages belong to may be delivered over a physical or logical link, or it can pass through a certain network node.   Throughput is usually measured in bits per second (bit/s or bps), and sometimes in data packets per second (p/s or pps) or data packets per time slot. 

TiVo<====>30936<====>TiVo   TiVo (   ) is a digital video recorder (DVR) developed and marketed by TiVo Corporation and introduced in 1999.   TiVo provides an on-screen guide of scheduled broadcast programming television programs, whose features include "Season Pass" schedules which record every new episode of a series, and "WishList" searches which allow the user to find and record shows that match their interests by title, actor, director, category, or keyword.  TiVo also provides a range of features when the TiVo DVR is connected to a home network, including film and television show downloads, advanced search, personal photo viewing, music offerings, and online scheduling.

Music careerIn 1988, McManus substituted for guitarist Soig Siberil in the supergroup Celtic Fiddle Festival, which consisted of  fiddlers Johnny Cunningham, Kevin Burke, and Christian Lemaitre.  He has worked as accompanist for Catriona MacDonald and for singer, guitarist, and fiddler Brian McNeill.  McManus's album Return to Kintail was a duet with Scottish fiddler Alasdair Fraser.    In addition to traditional Celtic music, McManus explored classical music when he performed Erik Satie for a movie by Neal Jordan. 

Tacticity<====>30941<====>TacticityTacticity (from Greek τακτικός taktikos "of or relating to arrangement or order") is the relative stereochemistry of adjacent chiral centers within a macromolecule.   The practical significance of tacticity rests on the effects on the physical properties of the polymer.  The regularity of the macromolecular structure influences the degree to which it has rigid, crystalline long range order or flexible, amorphous long range disorder.  Precise knowledge of tacticity of a polymer also helps understanding at what temperature a polymer melts, how soluble it is in a solvent and its mechanical properties. A tactic macromolecule in the IUPAC definition is a macromolecule in which essentially all the configurational (repeating) units are identical. 

Tobacco<====>30942<====>Tobacco   Tobacco is a product prepared from the leaves of the tobacco plant by curing them.  The plant is part of the genus Nicotiana and of the Solanaceae (nightshade) family.  While more than 70 species of tobacco are known, the chief commercial crop is N.  tabacum.  The more potent variant N.  rustica is also used around the world. Tobacco contains the alkaloid nicotine, which is a stimulant, and harmala alkaloids.   Dried tobacco leaves are mainly used for smoking in cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, and flavored shisha tobacco.  They can also be consumed as snuff, chewing tobacco, dipping tobacco and snus. 

National anthem of South Africa<====>30944<====>National anthem of South Africa   The current national anthem of South Africa was adopted in 1997 and is a hybrid song combining new Afrikaans and English lyrics with extracts of the hymn "Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika" ( ) and "Die Stem van Suid-Afrika" ( ). StructureThe fact that it shifts (modulates) and ends in a different key, a feature it shares with the Italian and the Philippine national anthems,  makes it compositionally unusual.  The lyrics employ the five of the most widely spoken of South Africa's eleven official languages – Xhosa (first stanza, first two lines), Zulu (first stanza, last two lines), Sesotho (second stanza), Afrikaans (third stanza), and English (final stanza). 

The Undertones<====>30950<====>The Undertones The Undertones are a punk rock/new wave band formed in Derry, Northern Ireland, in 1974.  From 1975 to 1983, the Undertones consisted of Feargal Sharkey (vocals), John O'Neill (rhythm guitar, vocals), Damian O'Neill (lead guitar, vocals), Michael Bradley (bass, vocals) and Billy Doherty (drums).  Much of the earlier Undertones material drew influence from punk rock and new wave; the Undertones also incorporated elements of rock, glam rock and post-punk into material released after 1979, before citing soul and Motown as the influence for the material released upon their final album.  The Undertones released thirteen singles and four studio albums between 1978 and 1983 before Sharkey announced his intention to leave the band in May 1983,    citing musical differences as the reason for the break up. 

Tom Lehrer<====>30951<====>Tom Lehrer  Thomas Andrew Lehrer ( ; born April 9, 1928) is a retired American musician, singer-songwriter, satirist, and mathematician.  He has lectured on mathematics and musical theater.  He is best known for the pithy, humorous songs he recorded in the 1950s and 1960s. Lehrer’s work often parodies popular song forms, though he usually creates original melodies when doing so.  A notable exception is "The Elements", where he sets the names of the chemical elements to the tune of the Major-General's song from Gilbert and Sullivan's Pirates of Penzance.  Lehrer's early work typically dealt with non-topical subject matter and was noted for its black humor in songs such as "Poisoning Pigeons in the Park". 

The Sophia of Jesus Christ<====>30955<====>The Sophia of Jesus Christ The Sophia of Jesus Christ is one of many Gnostic tractates from the Nag Hammadi codices, discovered in Egypt in 1945.  The Coptic manuscript itself has been dated to the 4th century; however, it is complemented by a few fragments in Greek dating from the 3rd century, implying an earlier date.  The text has strong similarities to the Epistle of Eugnostos, which is also found in the Nag Hammadi codices, but with a Christian framing added, and expanding it somewhat.  BackgroundThe debate about dating is critical, since some argue that it reflects the "true, recorded, sayings" of Jesus, which is possible if they were to be dated as far back as the 1st century. 

Tuatha Dé Danann<====>30957<====>Tuatha Dé Danann  The Tuath(a) Dé Danann ( , usually translated as "people(s)/tribe(s) of the goddess Dana or Danu", also known by the earlier name Tuath Dé ("tribe of the gods"), Koch, John T.  Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia.  ABC-CLIO, 2006.  pp. 1693-1695  are a supernatural race in Irish mythology.  They are thought to represent the main deities of pre-Christian Gaelic Ireland.   The Tuatha Dé Danann constitute a pantheon whose attributes appeared in a number of forms all across the Celtic world.  The Tuath Dé dwell in the Otherworld but interact with humans and the human world. 

Time-sharing<====>30958<====>Time-sharing  In computing, time-sharing is the sharing of a computing resource among many users by means of multiprogramming and multi-tasking at the same time.  DEC TIMESHARING (1965), by Peter Clark, The DEC Professional, VOLUME 1, Number 1 Its introduction in the 1960s and emergence as the prominent model of computing in the 1970s represented a major technological shift in the history of computing. By allowing a large number of users to interact concurrently with a single computer, time-sharing dramatically lowered the cost of providing computing capability, made it possible for individuals and organizations to use a computer without owning one,  and promoted the interactive use of computers and the development of new interactive applications. 

The Dagda<====>30959<====>The Dagda   An Dagda (Meaning 'The Good God' ) is an important god of Irish mythology.  One of the Tuatha Dé Danann, the Dagda is portrayed as a father-figure, chieftain, and druid.  Koch, John T.  Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia.  ABC-CLIO, 2006.  pp. 553-554  An Dagda.

Tuba<====>30961<====>Tuba   The tuba (  or  ;   ) is the largest and lowest-pitched musical instrument in the brass family.  Like all brass instruments, sound is produced by moving air past the lips, causing them to vibrate or "buzz" into a large cupped mouthpiece.  It first appeared in the mid 19th-century, making it one of the newer instruments in the modern orchestra and concert band.  The tuba largely replaced the ophicleide.   Tuba is Latin for 'trumpet'.  In America, a person who plays the tuba is known as a tubaist or tubist. 

Saint Timothy<====>30963<====>Saint Timothy Timothy (Greek:  ; Timótheos, meaning "honouring God"   or "honoured by God"  ) was an early Christian evangelist and the first first-century Christian bishop of Ephesus,  who tradition relates died around the year AD 97. Timothy was from the Lycaonian city of Lystra in Asia Minor, born of a Jewish mother who had become a Christian believer, and a Greek father.  The Apostle Paul met him during his second missionary journey and he became Paul’s companion and co-worker along with Silas.   The New Testament indicates that Timothy traveled with Saint Paul, who was also his mentor. 

Third Epistle of John<====>30964<====>Third Epistle of John  The Third Epistle of John, often referred to as Third John and written 3 John, is the antepenultimate book of the New Testament and attributed to John the Evangelist, traditionally thought to be the author of the Gospel of John and the other two epistles of John.  The Third Epistle of John is a private letter composed to a man named Gaius, recommending to him a group of Christians led by Demetrius, which had come to preach the gospel in the area where Gaius lived.  The purpose of the letter is to encourage and strengthen Gaius, and to warn him against Diotrephes, who refuses to cooperate with the author of the letter. 

The Band<====>30965<====>The Band    The Band was a Canadian-American roots rock group formed in Toronto, Ontario in 1968 by Rick Danko (bass guitar, vocals), Garth Hudson (keyboards, saxophone), Richard Manuel (keyboards, vocals), Robbie Robertson (guitar), and Levon Helm (drums, vocals).  The members of The Band first came together as they joined the rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins's backing group, the Hawks, one by one between 1958 and 1963. In 1964, they separated from Hawkins, after which they toured and released a few singles as Levon and the Hawks and the Canadian Squires.  The next year, Bob Dylan hired them for his U. 

Tempo<====>30967<====>Tempo   In musical terminology, tempo   ("time" in Italian; plural: tempi  ) is the speed or pace of a given piece.  In classical music, tempo is usually indicated with an instruction at the start of a piece (often using conventional Italian terms).  Tempo is usually measured in beats per minute (BPM).  In modern classical compositions a "metronome mark" in beats per minute may supplement or replace the normal tempo marking, while in modern genres like electronic dance music, tempo will typically simply be stated in BPM. Tempo may be separated from articulation and metre, or these aspects may be indicated along with tempo, all contributing to the overall texture. 

Tommy James and the Shondells<====>30969<====>Tommy James and the Shondells Tommy James and the Shondells are an American rock band, formed in Niles, Michigan in 1964.   They had two No.  1 singles in the U.

Tunnel in the Sky<====>30971<====>Tunnel in the Sky Tunnel in the Sky is a juvenile science fiction novel  by American writer Robert A.  Heinlein, published in 1955 by Scribner's as one of the Heinlein juveniles.  The story describes a group of students sent on a survival test to an uninhabited planet, who soon realise they are stranded there.  The themes of the work include the difficulties of growing up and the nature of man as a social animal. Plot summaryA Malthusian catastrophe on Earth has been averted by the invention of teleportation, called the "Ramsbotham jump", which is used to send Earth's excess population to colonize other planets. 

Jupiter trojan<====>30972<====>Jupiter trojan The Jupiter trojans, commonly called Trojan asteroids or just Trojans, are a large group of asteroids that share the planet Jupiter's orbit around the Sun.   They are named for heroes in the ancient Greek tales of the Trojan War.   Relative to Jupiter, each Trojan librates around one of Jupiter's two stable Lagrange points:  , lying 60° ahead of the planet in its orbit, and  , 60° behind.  Jupiter trojans are distributed in two elongated, curved regions around these Lagrangian points with an average semi-major axis of about 5. 2 AU.    If you draw a line from Jupiter to each group of asteroids (one group that follows Jupiter in its orbit, and others that move ahead of it in its orbit), and then draw lines from Jupiter and both groups to the Sun, you will have two equal-sided triangles. 

Theorem<====>30977<====>Theorem  In mathematics, a theorem is a statement that has been proved on the basis of previously established statements, such as other theorems, and generally accepted statements, such as axioms.  A theorem is a logical consequence of the axioms.  The proof of a mathematical theorem is a logical argument for the theorem statement given in accord with the rules of a deductive system.  The proof of a theorem is often interpreted as justification of the truth of the theorem statement.  In light of the requirement that theorems be proved, the concept of a theorem is fundamentally deductive, in contrast to the notion of a scientific law, which is experimental.

Austin has superhuman strength due to bionic implants and is employed as a secret agent by a fictional U. S.  government office titled OSI.   The series was based on the Martin Caidin novel Cyborg, which was the working title of the series during pre-production.  Following three television pilot movies, which all aired in 1973, The Six Million Dollar Man television series aired on the ABC network as a regular episodic series for five seasons from 1974 to 1978. 

Tory<====>30980<====>Tory  A Tory ( ) holds a political philosophy (Toryism) based on a British version of traditionalism and conservatism, which upholds the supremacy of social order as it has evolved throughout history.  The Tory ethos has been summed up with the phrase "God, King, and Country".   Tories generally advocate monarchism, are usually of a high church Anglican religious heritage   and are opposed to the liberalism of the Whig faction.  In Britain, the Tory political faction originated with the Cavaliers during the English Civil War.  It also had exponents in other parts of the former British Empire, such as the Loyalists of British America who opposed American secession during the American War of Independence. 

Toronto Transit Commission<====>30981<====>Toronto Transit Commission  The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) is a public transport agency that operates bus, subway, streetcar, and paratransit services in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  It is the oldest and largest of the urban transit service providers in the Greater Toronto Area, with numerous connections to systems serving its surrounding municipalities. Established as the Toronto Transportation Commission in 1921, the TTC owns and operates four rapid transit lines with 75 stations, over 149 bus routes, and 11 streetcar lines.

Testosterone<====>30983<====>Testosterone  {{Chembox }}Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone and an anabolic steroid.   In men, testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as testes and prostate, as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass, and the growth of body hair and facial hair.In addition, testosterone is involved in health and well-being,    and the prevention of osteoporosis.Insufficient levels of testosterone in men may lead to abnormalities including frailty and bone loss. Testosterone is a steroid from the androstane class containing a keto and hydroxyl groups at the three and seventeen positions respectively. 

Toyota<====>30984<====>Toyotais a Japanese multinational automotive manufacturer headquartered in Toyota, Aichi, Japan.    In 2017, Toyota's corporate structure consisted of 364,445 employees worldwide  and,  , was the fifth-largest company in the world by revenue.  As of 2016, Toyota is the world's largest automotive manufacturer.  Toyota was the world's first automobile manufacturer to produce more than 10 million vehicles per year which it has done since 2012, when it also reported the production of its 200-millionth vehicle.    , Toyota was the largest listed company in Japan by market capitalization (worth more than twice as much as #2-ranked SoftBank)  and by revenue. 

Tabloid (newspaper format)<====>30985<====>Tabloid (newspaper format)  A tabloid is a newspaper with a compact page size smaller than broadsheet.  A tabloid is defined as "roughly  " and commonly "half the size of a broadsheet", although there is no standard size for this newspaper format. The term tabloid journalism refers to an emphasis on such topics as sensational crime stories, astrology, celebrity gossip and television, and is not a reference to newspapers printed in this format.  Some small-format papers with a high standard of journalism refer to themselves as compact newspapers.  Larger newspapers, traditionally associated with higher-quality journalism, are called broadsheets, even if the newspaper is now printed on smaller pages. 

Tibetan Buddhism<====>30988<====>Tibetan BuddhismTibetan Buddhism is the form of Vajrayana Buddhist doctrine and institutions named after the lands of Tibet, but also found in the regions surrounding the Himalayas and much of Central Asia.  It derives from the latest stages of Indian Buddhism and preserves "the Tantric status quo of eighth-century India. "  It has been spread outside of Tibet, especially due to the Mongol power of the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), founded by Kublai Khan, that also ruled China. Tibetan Buddhism applies Tantric practices, especially deity yoga, and aspires to Buddhahood or the rainbow body. 

Thermocouple<====>30990<====>Thermocouple A thermocouple is an electrical device consisting of two dissimilar electrical conductors forming electrical junctions at differing temperatures.  A thermocouple produces a temperature-dependent voltage as a result of the thermoelectric effect, and this voltage can be interpreted to measure temperature.  Thermocouples are a widely used type of temperature sensor.    Commercial thermocouples are inexpensive,    interchangeable, are supplied with standard connectors, and can measure a wide range of temperatures.  In contrast to most other methods of temperature measurement, thermocouples are self powered and require no external form of excitation.  The main limitation with thermocouples is accuracy; system errors of less than one degree Celsius (°C) can be difficult to achieve. 

Thermistor<====>30992<====>Thermistor A thermistor is a type of resistor whose resistance is dependent on temperature, more so than in standard resistors.  The word is a portmanteau of thermal and resistor.  Thermistors are widely used as inrush current limiter, temperature sensors (Negative Temperature Coefficient or NTC type typically), self-resetting overcurrent protectors, and self-regulating heating elements (Positive Temperature Coefficient or PTC type typically). Thermistors are of two opposite fundamental types:With NTC thermistors, resistance decreases as temperature rises.  An NTC is commonly used as a temperature sensor, or in series with a circuit as an inrush current limiter.   With PTC thermistors, resistance increases as temperature rises. 

Thermometer<====>30993<====>ThermometerA thermometer is a device that measures temperature or a temperature gradient.  A thermometer has two important elements: (1) a temperature sensor (e. g.  the bulb of a mercury-in-glass thermometer or the digital sensor in an infrared thermometer) in which some change occurs with a change in temperature, and (2) some means of converting this change into a numerical value (e. g.  the visible scale that is marked on a mercury-in-glass thermometer or the digital readout on an infrared model).  Thermometers are widely used in industry to monitor processes, in meteorology, in medicine, and in scientific research. 

Theravada<====>30994<====>Theravada  Theravāda (Pali, literally "school of the elder monks") is a branch of Buddhism that uses the Buddha's teaching preserved in the Pāli Canon as its doctrinal core.  The Pali canon is the only complete Buddhist canon which survives in a classical Indic Language, Pali, which serves as the sacred language and lingua franca of Theravada Buddhism.   Another feature of Theravada is its tendency to be very conservative with regard to matters of doctrine and monastic discipline.   As a distinct sect, Theravada Buddhism developed in Sri Lanka and spread to the rest of Southeast Asia. 

Outline of theatre<====>31001<====>Outline of theatre The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to theatre:Theatre (also theater) – branch of the performing arts and a collaborative form of fine art involving live performers to present the experience of a real or imagined event (such as a story) through acting before a live audience in a specific place.  The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of speech, gesture, mime, puppets, music, dance, sound and spectacle — indeed any one or more elements of the other performing arts.   Elements of design and stagecraft are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience. 

Phenotypic trait<====>31006<====>Phenotypic trait  A phenotypic trait, or simply trait, is a distinct variant of a phenotypic characteristic of an organism; it may be either inherited or  determined environmentally, but typically occurs as a combination of the two.  Lawrence, Eleanor (2005) Henderson's Dictionary of Biology.  Pearson, Prentice Hall. For example, eye color is a character of an organism,    while blue, brown and hazel are traits. DefinitionA phenotypic trait is an obvious, observable, and measurable trait; it is the expression of genes in an observable way.  An example of a phenotypic trait is hair color; underlying genes, which make up the genotype, "control" the hair color, but the actual hair color, the part we see, is the phenotype. 

Trabant<====>31010<====>Trabant   The Trabant ( ;  ) is an automobile which was produced from 1957 to 1990 by former East German car manufacturer VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau.  Although it is often seen as symbolic of the defunct East Germany and the collapse of the Eastern Bloc in general, it was a sought-after car in East Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall.  The Trabant had a hard plastic body mounted on a one-piece steel chassis (a so-called unibody or monocoque), front-wheel drive, a transverse engine, and independent suspension  unusual features at that time. Called "a spark plug with a roof", 3,096,999 Trabants in a number of models were produced over nearly three decades with few significant changes in their basic design. 

There Is No Cabal<====>31011<====>There Is No Cabal There Is No Cabal is a catchphrase used on Usenet.    Its common abbreviation, TINC, is used humorously to suggest that people should lighten up and not see a conspiracy around every corner. It is alternatively used as a pseudo-ironic statement, since presumably an insider or someone who knows "the cabal" would inevitably deny that there is a cabal. It was used extensively by members of the backbone cabal.See alsoInternet memeLumber CartelExternal linksEntry for "TINC" at the Jargon Filealt.conspiracy.usenet-cabal FAQ on the Cabal and TINCCabal meeting minutesReferences

Teletubbies<====>31015<====>Teletubbies    Teletubbies is a British pre-school children's television series created by Ragdoll Productions' Anne Wood and Andrew Davenport.  The programme focuses on four multi-coloured creatures known as "Teletubbies", named for the television screens implanted in their abdomens.  Recognised throughout popular culture for the uniquely shaped antenna protruding from the heads of each character, the Teletubbies communicate through gibberish and were designed to bear resemblance to young children.  Particularly notable for its high production values, the series rapidly became a commercial success in Britain and abroad.  It won multiple BAFTA awards and was nominated for two Daytime Emmys throughout its run. 

Terrestrial Time<====>31016<====>Terrestrial Time Terrestrial Time (TT) is a modern astronomical time standard defined by the International Astronomical Union, primarily for time-measurements of astronomical observations made from the surface of Earth.  For example, the Astronomical Almanac uses TT for its tables of positions (ephemerides) of the Sun, Moon and planets as seen from Earth.  In this role, TT continues Terrestrial Dynamical Time (TDT or TD), TT is equivalent to TDT, see IAU conference 1991, Resolution A4, recommendation IV, note 4.   which in turn succeeded ephemeris time (ET).  TT shares the original purpose for which ET was designed, to be free of the irregularities in the rotation of Earth. 

Tatra 600<====>31020<====>Tatra 600 The Tatra 600, named the Tatraplan, was a rear-engined large family car (D-segment in Europe) produced from 1948 to 1952 by the Czech manufacturer Tatra.  The first prototype was finished in 1946. HistoryAfter World War II, Tatra continued its pre-war business of building passenger cars in addition to commercial vehicles and military vehicles.  The factory was nationalised in 1946 two years before the Communist takeover.  Although production of pre-war models continued, a new model, the Tatra 600 Tatraplan was designed in 1946-47 by Josef Chalupa, Vladimír Popelář, František Kardaus and Hans Ledwinka.  The name of the car celebrated the new Communist planned economy but also referred to aeroplane inspiration ('éroplan' means aeroplane in colloquial Czech). 

Taking Children Seriously<====>31029<====>Taking Children Seriously Taking Children Seriously (T. C. S. ) is a parenting movement and educational philosophy whose central idea is that it is possible and desirable to raise and educate children without either doing anything to them against their will, or making them do anything against their will. It was founded in 1994 as an on-line mailing-list by the libertarians Sarah Fitz-Claridge and David Deutsch.  Deutsch is also a theoretical physicist at Oxford University.  T. C.

Protein tertiary structure<====>31032<====>Protein tertiary structure  Protein tertiary structure is the three dimensional shape of a protein.  The tertiary structure will have a single polypeptide chain "backbone" with one or more protein secondary structures, the protein domains.  Amino acid side chains may interact and bond in a number of ways.  The interactions and bonds of side chains within a particular protein determine its tertiary structure.  The protein tertiary structure is defined by its atomic coordinates.  These coordinates may refer either to a protein domain or to the entire tertiary structure.   Branden C.  and Tooze J. 

Great Molasses Flood<====>31033<====>Great Molasses Flood   The Great Molasses Flood, also known as the Boston Molasses Disaster or the Great Boston Molasses Flood, occurred on January 15, 1919 in the North End neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts.  A large molasses storage tank burst and a wave of molasses rushed through the streets at an estimated  , killing 21 and injuring 150.  The event entered local folklore and for decades afterwards residents claimed that on hot summer days the area still smelled of molasses.  FloodThe disaster occurred at the Purity Distilling Company facility on January 15, 1919.   The temperature had risen above  , climbing rapidly from the frigid temperatures of the preceding days. 

Ted Hughes<====>31034<====>Ted Hughes   Edward James Hughes,   (17 August 1930 – 28 October 1998) was an English poet and children's writer.  Critics frequently rank him as one of the best poets of his generation,  and one of the twentieth century's greatest writers.   He served as Poet Laureate from 1984 until his death.  In 2008 The Times ranked Hughes fourth on their list of "The 50 greatest British writers since 1945".  Hughes was married to American poet Sylvia Plath from 1956 until her suicide in 1963 at the age of 30.   His tumultuous and often abusive relationship with Plath is considered a reason for her suicide by some. 

Thomas Wolsey<====>31035<====>Thomas Wolsey  Thomas Wolsey (c.  March 1473  – 29 November 1530; sometimes spelled Woolsey or Wulcy) was an English churchman, statesman and a cardinal of the Catholic Church.  When Henry VIII became King of England in 1509, Wolsey became the King's almoner.  Oxford Dictionary National Biography, Thomas Wolsey.   Wolsey's affairs prospered, and by 1514 he had become the controlling figure in virtually all matters of state and extremely powerful within the Church, as Archbishop of York, a cleric in England junior only to the Archbishop of Canterbury.  His appointment in 1515 as a cardinal by Pope Leo X gave him precedence over all other English clerics. 

Triode<====>31036<====>Triode  A triode is an electronic amplifying vacuum tube (or valve in British English) consisting of three electrodes inside an evacuated glass envelope: a heated filament or cathode, a grid, and a plate (anode).  Developed from Lee De Forest's 1906 Audion, a partial vacuum tube that added a grid electrode to the thermionic diode (Fleming valve), the triode was the first practical electronic amplifier and the ancestor of other types of vacuum tubes such as the tetrode and pentode.  Its invention founded the electronics age, making possible amplified radio technology and long-distance telephony.  Triodes were widely used in consumer electronics devices such as radios and televisions until the 1970s, when transistors replaced them. 

Flower Pot Men<====>31038<====>Flower Pot Men    The Flower Pot Men is a British children's programme, produced by BBC television, first transmitted in 1952, and repeated regularly for more than twenty years.   The show was the basis for a comic strip of the same name in the children's magazine Robin.   A reboot of the show called Bill and Ben was produced in 2001.    Original seriesOriginally, the programme was part of a BBC children's television series titled Watch with Mother, with a different programme each weekday, most of them involving string puppets.  The Flower Pot Men was the story of Bill and Ben, two little men made of flower pots who lived at the bottom of an English suburban garden. 

Turboprop<====>31039<====>Turboprop A turboprop engine is a turbine engine that drives an aircraft propeller.   In contrast to a turbojet, the engine's exhaust gases do not contain enough energy to create significant thrust, since almost all of the engine's power is used to drive the propeller. In its simplest form a turboprop consists of an intake, compressor, combustor, turbine, and a propelling nozzle.  Air is drawn into the intake and compressed by the compressor.  Fuel is then added to the compressed air in the combustor, where the fuel-air mixture then combusts.  The hot combustion gases expand through the turbine. 

Tomaso Albinoni<====>31040<====>Tomaso AlbinoniTomaso Giovanni Albinoni (8 June 1671 – 17 January 1751) was an Italian Baroque composer.  While famous in his day as an opera composer, he is mainly remembered today for his instrumental music, such as the concerto.    BiographyBorn in Venice, Republic of Venice, to Antonio Albinoni, a wealthy paper merchant in Venice, he studied violin and singing.  Relatively little is known about his life, especially considering his contemporary stature as a composer, and the comparatively well-documented period in which he lived.  In 1694 he dedicated his Opus 1 to the fellow-Venetian, Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni (grand-nephew of Pope Alexander VIII); Ottoboni was an important patron in Rome of other composers, such as Arcangelo Corelli. 

Trust law<====>31043<====>Trust law   A trust is a three-party fiduciary relationship in which the first party, the trustor or settlor, transfers ("settles") a property (often but not necessarily a sum of money) upon the second party (the trustee) for the benefit of the third party, the beneficiary.   A testamentary trust is created by a will and arises after the death of the settlor.   An inter vivos trust is created during the settlor's lifetime by a trust instrument.   A trust may be revocable or irrevocable; in the United States, a trust is presumed to be irrevocable unless the instrument or will creating it states it is revocable, except in California, Oklahoma and Texas, in which trusts are presumed to be revocable until the instrument or will creating them states they are irrevocable. 

Tone row<====>31045<====>Tone row In music, a tone row or note row (  or  ), also series or set, George Perle, Serial Composition and Atonality: An Introduction to the Music of Schoenberg, Berg, and Webern, fourth Edition (Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London: University of California Press, 1977): 3.   .   is a non-repetitive ordering of a set of pitch-classes, typically of the twelve notes in musical set theory of the chromatic scale, though both larger and smaller sets are sometimes found.

Time transfer<====>31049<====>Time transferTime transfer is a scheme where multiple sites share a precise reference time.   Time transfer solves problems such as astronomical observatories correlating observed flashes or other phenomena with each other, as well as cell phone towers coordinating handoffs as a phone moves from one cell to another. Multiple techniques have been developed, often transferring reference clock synchronization from one point to another, often over long distances.   Accuracy approaching one nanosecond worldwide is economically practical for many applications.   Radio-based navigation systems are frequently used as time transfer systems. In some cases, multiple measurements are made over a period of time, and exact time synchronization is determined retrospectively. 

Three-chord song<====>31051<====>Three-chord songA three-chord song is a song whose music is built around three chords that are played in a certain sequence.  A common type of three-chord song is the simple twelve-bar blues used in blues and rock and roll. Typically, the three chords used are the chords on the tonic, subdominant, and dominant (scale degrees I, IV and V): in the key of C, these would be the C, F and G chords.  Sometimes the V 7  chord is used instead of V, for greater tension. The I (tonic), IV (subdominant) and V (dominant) chords (primary triads) together encompass all seven tones of the tonic's major scale. 

Trakehner<====>31052<====>TrakehnerTrakehner is a light warmblood breed of horse, originally developed at the East Prussian state stud farm in the town of Trakehnen from which the breed takes its name.   The state stud (de:Hauptgestüt Trakehnen) was established in 1731 and operated until 1944, when the fighting of World War II led to the annexing of East Prussia by Russia, and the town containing the stud renamed as Yasnaya Polyana. The Trakehner typically stands between  .  They can be any color, with bay, gray, chestnut and black being the most common, though the breed also includes few roan and tobiano pinto horses. 

Tempera<====>31053<====>Tempera Tempera ( ), also known as egg tempera, is a permanent, fast-drying painting medium consisting of colored pigments mixed with a water-soluble binder medium (usually glutinous material such as egg yolk or some other size).  Tempera also refers to the paintings done in this medium.  Tempera paintings are very long lasting, and examples from the first century AD still exist.   Egg tempera was a primary method of painting until after 1500 when it was superseded by the invention of oil painting.   A paint consisting of pigment and glue size commonly used in the United States as poster paint is also often referred to as "tempera paint," although the binders and sizes in this paint are different from traditional tempera paint. 

Theological virtues<====>31054<====>Theological virtues Theological virtues are virtues associated in Christian theology and philosophy with salvation resulting from the grace of God.    Virtues are traits or qualities which dispose one to conduct oneself in a morally good manner.  Traditionally they have been named faith, hope, and charity, and can trace their importance in Christian theology to Paul the Apostle in 1 Corinthians 13, who also pointed out charity is the most important. The medieval Catholic philosopher Thomas Aquinas explained that these virtues are called theological virtues "because they have God for their object, both in so far as by them we are properly directed to Him, and because they are infused into our souls by God alone, as also, finally, because we come to know of them only by Divine revelation in the Sacred Scriptures". 

The Rolling Stones<====>31056<====>The Rolling StonesThe Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London, England in 1962.  The first stable line-up consisted of Brian Jones (guitar, harmonica), Mick Jagger (lead vocals), Keith Richards (guitar, backing vocals), Bill Wyman (bass), Charlie Watts (drums), and Ian Stewart (piano).  Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued as a touring member until his death in 1985.  Jones left the band less than a month prior to his death in 1969, having already been replaced by Mick Taylor, who remained until 1974.   After Taylor left the band, Ronnie Wood took his place in 1975 and has been on guitar in tandem with Richards ever since. 

Tipu Sultan<====>31058<====>Tipu Sultan    Tipu Sultan (born  Sultan Fateh Ali Sahab Tipu,  10 November 1750 – 4 May 1799), also known as the  Tipu Sahib,  was a ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore.  He was the eldest son of Sultan Hyder Ali of Mysore.   Tipu introduced a number of administrative innovations during his rule,  including his coinage, a new Mauludi lunisolar calendar,  and a new land revenue system which initiated the growth of the Mysore silk industry.   He expanded the iron-cased Mysorean rockets and commissioned the military manual Fathul Mujahidin, and is considered a pioneer in the use of rocket artillery. 

Telnet<====>31062<====>Telnet  Telnet is a protocol used on the Internet or local area networks to provide a bidirectional interactive text-oriented communication facility using a virtual terminal connection.  User data is interspersed in-band with Telnet control information in an 8-bit byte oriented data connection over the  Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Telnet was developed in 1969 beginning with RFC 15, extended in RFC 854, and standardized as Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Internet Standard STD 8, one of the first Internet standards.  The name stands for "teletype network".   Historically, Telnet provided access to a command-line interface (usually, of an operating system) on a remote host, including most network equipment and operating systems with a configuration utility (including systems based on Windows NT). 

The Star-Spangled Banner<====>31064<====>The Star-Spangled Banner  "The Star-Spangled Banner" is the national anthem of the United States of America.  The lyrics come from "Defence of Fort M'Henry",  a poem written on  September 14, 1814, by the 35-year-old lawyer and amateur poet Francis Scott Key after witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry by British ships of the Royal Navy in Baltimore Harbor during the Battle of Baltimore in the War of 1812.  Key was inspired by the large American flag, the Star-Spangled Banner, flying triumphantly above the fort during the American victory. The poem was set to the tune of a popular British song written by John Stafford Smith for the Anacreontic Society, a men's social club in London. 

Third Council of the Lateran<====>31065<====>Third Council of the Lateran  The Third Council of the Lateran met in March 1179 as the eleventh ecumenical council.  Pope Alexander III presided and 302 bishops attended. By agreement reached at the Peace of Venice in 1177 the bitter conflict between Alexander III and Emperor Frederick I was brought to an end.  When Pope Adrian IV died in 1159, the divided cardinals elected two popes: Roland of Siena, who took the name of Alexander III, and Octavian of Rome who, though nominated by fewer cardinals, was supported by Frederick and assumed the name of Pope Victor IV. 

The Third Culture<====>31066<====>The Third Culture   The Third Culture is a 1995 book by John Brockman which discusses the work of several well-known scientists who are directly communicating their new, sometimes provocative, ideas to the general public.  John Brockman has continued the themes of 'The Third Culture' in the website of the Edge Foundation, where leading scientists and thinkers contribute their thoughts in plain English. The title of the book refers to Charles Percy Snow's 1959 work The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution, which described the conflict between the cultures of the humanities and science. ContentsTwenty-three people were included in the 1995 book:physicist Paul Daviesbiologist Richard Dawkins philosopher Daniel Dennettpaleontologist Niles Eldredgechaos theorist J. 

The Importance of Being Earnest<====>31067<====>The Importance of Being Earnest    The Importance of Being Earnest, A Trivial Comedy for Serious People is a play by Oscar Wilde.  First performed on 14 February 1895 at the St James's Theatre in London, it is a farcical comedy in which the protagonists maintain fictitious personæ to escape burdensome social obligations.  Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London, the play's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of Victorian ways.  Contemporary reviews all praised the play's humour, though some were cautious about its explicit lack of social messages, while others foresaw the modern consensus that it was the culmination of Wilde's artistic career so far. 

Analogy of the divided line<====>31068<====>Analogy of the divided line  The Analogy of the Divided Line ( ) is presented by the Greek philosopher Plato in the  Republic (509d–511e).  It is written as a dialogue between Glaucon and Socrates, in which the latter further elaborates upon the immediately preceding Analogy of the Sun at the former's request.  Socrates asks Glaucon to not only envision this unequally bisected line but to imagine further bisecting each of the two segments.  Socrates explains that the four resulting segments represent four separate 'affections' (παθήματα) of the psyche.  The lower two sections are said to represent the visible while the higher two are said to represent the intelligible. 

Themistocles<====>31069<====>Themistocles  Themistocles ( ;Themistoklẽs; "Glory of the Law";  c.  524–459 BC) was an Athenian politician and general.  He was one of a new breed of non-aristocratic politicians who rose to prominence in the early years of the Athenian democracy.  As a politician, Themistocles was a populist, having the support of lower-class Athenians, and generally being at odds with the Athenian nobility.  Elected archon in 493 BC, he convinced the polis to increase the naval power of Athens, a recurring theme in his political career.  During the first Persian invasion of Greece he fought at the Battle of Marathon  (490 BC) and was possibly one of the ten Athenian strategoi (generals) in that battle. 

Toonie<====>31074<====>Toonie The Canadian two-dollar coin, commonly called the toonie, is the most valuable of the frequently used Canadian coins.   It was introduced on February 19, 1996, by Public Works minister Diane Marleau.  The toonie is a bi-metallic coin which on the reverse side bears an image of a polar bear by artist Brent Townsend.  The obverse, like all other current Canadian circulation coins, has a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.  It has the words "ELIZABETH II / D. G.  REGINA" in a different typeface from any other Canadian coin; it is also the only coin to consistently bear its issue date on the obverse. 

Tirana<====>31075<====>Tirana    Tirana ( ;  ;  ) is the capital and most populous city of the Republic of Albania.  The city is as well the capital of the surrounding county of Tirana, one of 12 constituent counties of the country.  By air, it is   north of Athens,   east of Durrës,   southwest of Skopje and   southeast of Podgorica. Tirana was founded as a city in 1614, but the region that today corresponds to the city territory has been continuously inhabited since the Bronze Age.  As most of Albania, the area was populated by several Illyrian tribes, but had no importance within Illyria.

The Problem of Pain<====>31080<====>The Problem of Pain The Problem of Pain is a 1940 book on the problem of evil by C.  S.  Lewis, in which Lewis argues that human pain, animal pain, and hell are not sufficient reasons to reject belief in a good and powerful God. Lewis summarizes of the problem of evil like this: "If God were good, He would make His creatures perfectly happy, and if He were almighty He would be able to do what he wished.   But the creatures are not happy.   Therefore God lacks either goodness, or power, or both. 

Teaspoon<====>31083<====>Teaspoon   A teaspoon is an item of cutlery, a measuring instrument, of approximately 5ml, or a unit of measurement of volume (usually abbreviated tsp. ).  CutleryA teaspoon is a small spoon suitable for stirring and sipping the contents of a cup of tea or coffee, or adding a portion of loose sugar to it.  These spoons have heads more or less oval in shape.  Teaspoons are a common part of a place setting. Teaspoons with longer handles, such as iced tea spoons, are commonly used also for ice cream desserts or floats. 

Tablespoon<====>31084<====>TablespoonA tablespoon is a large spoon used for serving or eating.  In many English-speaking regions, the term now refers to a large spoon used for serving,  however, in some regions, including parts of Canada, it is the largest type of spoon used for eating.  By extension, the term is used as a measure of volume in cooking.  In this capacity, it is most commonly abbreviated tbsp or T, and occasionally referred to as a tablespoonful to distinguish it from the utensil.  The unit of measurement varies by region: a United States tablespoon is approximately  , a United Kingdom and Canadian tablespoon is exactly  ,  and an Australian tablespoon is  . 

The Seekers<====>31085<====>The Seekers    The Seekers are an Australian folk-influenced pop quartet, originally formed in Melbourne in 1962.   They were the first Australian pop music group to achieve major chart and sales success in the United Kingdom and the United States.   They were popular during the 1960s with their best-known configuration as: Judith Durham on vocals, piano, and tambourine; Athol Guy on double bass and vocals; Keith Potger on twelve-string guitar, banjo, and vocals; and Bruce Woodley on guitar, mandolin, banjo, and vocals.

Masaccio<====>31086<====>Masaccio Masaccio ( ; December 21, 1401 – summer 1428), born Tommaso di Ser Giovanni di Simone, was the first great Italian painter of the Quattrocento period of the Italian Renaissance.  According to Vasari, Masaccio was the best painter of his generation because of his skill at imitating nature, recreating lifelike figures and movements as well as a convincing sense of three-dimensionality.   Masaccio died at twenty-six and little is known about the exact circumstances of his death.  The name Masaccio is a humorous version of Maso (short for Tommaso), meaning "clumsy" or "messy" Tom.  The name may have been created to distinguish him from his principal collaborator, also called Maso, who came to be known as Masolino ("little/delicate Tom"). 

Timothy Leary<====>31088<====>Timothy Leary   Timothy Francis Leary (October 22, 1920 – May 31, 1996) was an American psychologist and writer known for advocating the exploration of the therapeutic potential of psychedelic drugs under controlled conditions.  Leary conducted experiments under the Harvard Psilocybin Project during American legality of LSD and psilocybin, resulting in the Concord Prison Experiment and the Marsh Chapel Experiment.  Leary's colleague, Richard Alpert (Ram Dass), was fired from Harvard University on May 27, 1963 for giving psilocybin to an undergraduate student.  Leary was planning to leave Harvard when his teaching contract expired in June, the following month.

During TMBG's early years, Flansburgh and Linnell frequently performed as a duo, often accompanied by a drum machine.   In the early 1990s, TMBG expanded to include a backing band.   The duo's current backing band consists of Marty Beller, Dan Miller, and Danny Weinkauf.  The group is best known for an unconventional and experimental style of alternative music.  Over their career, they have found success on the modern rock and CMJ charts. 

Titanite<====>31091<====>Titanite Titanite, or sphene (from the Greek sphenos (σφηνώ), meaning wedge ), is a calcium titanium nesosilicate mineral, CaTiSiO 5 .  Trace impurities of iron and aluminium are typically present.  Also commonly present are rare earth metals including cerium and yttrium; calcium may be partly replaced by thorium.  NomenclatureThe International Mineralogical Association Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names (CNMMN) adopted the name titanite  and 'discredited' the name sphene  as of 1982,  although commonly papers and books initially identify the mineral using both names.    Sphene was the most commonly used name until the IMA decision, although both were well known. 

Time management<====>31092<====>Time managementTime management is the process of planning and exercising conscious control over the amount of time spent on specific activities, especially to increase effectiveness, efficiency or productivity.  It is a juggling act of various demands of study, social life, employment, family, and personal interests and commitments with the finiteness of time.  Using time effectively gives the person "choice" on spending/ managing activities at their own time and expediency.  It is a meta-activity with the goal to maximize the overall benefit of a set of other activities within the boundary condition of a limited amount of time, as time itself cannot be managed because it is fixed. 

Turing Award<====>31093<====>Turing Award The ACM A. M.

Tupolev Tu-144<====>31102<====>Tupolev Tu-144The Tupolev Tu-144 ( ; NATO reporting name: Charger) is a retired jet airliner and  commercial supersonic transport aircraft (SST).  It is one of only two SSTs to enter commercial service, the other being the Anglo-French Concorde.  The design was a product of the Tupolev design bureau, headed by Alexei Tupolev, of the Soviet Union and manufactured by the Voronezh Aircraft Production Association in Voronezh, Russia.   It conducted 55 passenger service flights, at an average service altitude of   and cruised at a speed of around   (Mach 1. 6).    The prototype first flew on 31 December 1968 near Moscow,  two months before the first flight of the Concorde. 

Turing (programming language)<====>31105<====>Turing (programming language) Turing is a Pascal-like programming language developed in 1982 by Ric Holt and James Cordy, then of University of Toronto, Canada.  Turing is a descendant of Euclid, Pascal and SP/k that features a clean syntax and precise machine-independent semantics. Turing 4. 1. 0 is the latest stable version of Turing.  Turing 4. 1. 1 and Turing 4. 1. 2 do not allow for stand alone . EXE files to be created and versions before Turing 4. 1. 0 have outdated syntax and outdated functions. OverviewNamed after British computer scientist Alan Turing, Turing is used primarily as a teaching language at the high school and university level. 

Trackball<====>31106<====>TrackballA trackball is a pointing device consisting of a ball held by a socket containing sensors to detect a rotation of the ball about two axes—like an upside-down mouse with an exposed protruding ball.   The user rolls the ball to position the on-screen pointer, using their thumb, fingers, or commonly the palm of the hand while using the fingertips to press the mouse buttons. Compared with a mouse, a trackball has no limits on effective travel; at times, a mouse can reach an edge of its working area while the operator still wishes to move the screen pointer farther. 

Tape drive<====>31109<====>Tape driveA tape drive is a data storage device that reads and writes data on a magnetic tape.   Magnetic tape data storage is typically used for offline, archival data storage.   Tape media generally has a favorable unit cost and a long archival stability. A tape drive provides sequential access storage, unlike a hard disk drive, which provides direct access storage.   A disk drive can move to any position on the disk in a few milliseconds, but a tape drive must physically wind tape between reels to read any one particular piece of data.   As a result, tape drives have very slow average access times. 

Tesseract<====>31112<====>Tesseract  In geometry, the tesseract is the four-dimensional analog of the cube; the tesseract is to the cube as the cube is to the square.  Just as the surface of the cube consists of six square faces, the hypersurface of the tesseract consists of eight cubical cells.  The tesseract is one of the six convex regular 4-polytopes. The tesseract is also called an 8-cell, C 8 , (regular) octachoron, octahedroid,  cubic prism, and tetracube .  It is the four-dimensional hypercube, or 4-cube as a part of the dimensional family of hypercubes or "measure polytopes".  According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word tesseract was coined and first used in 1888 by Charles Howard Hinton in his book A New Era of Thought, from the Greek   (téssereis aktines, "four rays"), referring to the four lines from each vertex to other vertices. 

Richard Hell and the Voidoids<====>31113<====>Richard Hell and the Voidoids Richard Hell and the Voidoids were an American  punk rock band, formed in New York City in 1976 and fronted by Richard Hell, a former member of the Neon Boys, Television and the Heartbreakers. HistoryKentucky-born Richard Meyers moved to New York City after dropping out of high school in 1966, aspiring to become a poet.  He and his best friend from high school, Tom Miller, founded the rock band the Neon Boys which became Television in 1973.   The pair adopted stage names; Miller called himself Verlaine after Paul Verlaine, a French poet he admired, and Meyers became Richard Hell because, as he has said, it described his condition.

Temple of Set<====>31117<====>Temple of SetThe Temple of Set is an occult initiatory order founded in 1975.  A new religious movement and form of Western esotericism, the Temple espouses a religion known as Setianism, whose practitioners are called Setians.  This is sometimes identified as a form of Satanism, although this term is not often embraced by Setians and is contested by some academics.    The Temple was established in the United States in 1975 by Michael Aquino, an American political scientist, military officer, and a high-ranking member of Anton LaVey's Church of Satan.  Dissatisfied with the direction in which LaVey was taking the Church, Aquino resigned and – according to his own claim – embarked on a ritual to invoke Satan, who revealed to him a sacred text called The Book of Coming Forth by Night. 

Tate Modern<====>31119<====>Tate Modern Tate Modern is a modern art gallery located in London.  It is Britain's national gallery of international modern art and forms part of the Tate group (together with Tate Britain, Tate Liverpool, Tate St Ives and Tate Online).

She was the niece of the Byzantine Emperor John I Tzimiskes.  Her name is derived from Medieval Greek Theophaneia (Θεοφάνεια), "appearance of God" (Theophany). Early lifeAccording to the marriage certificate issued on 14 April 972—a masterpiece of the Ottonian Renaissance—Theophanu is identified as the neptis (niece or granddaughter) of Emperor John I Tzimiskes (925–976) who was of Armenian descent. 

Thomas Gainsborough<====>31126<====>Thomas Gainsborough   Thomas Gainsborough FRSA (14 May 1727 (baptised) – 2 August 1788) was an English portrait and landscape painter, draughtsman, and printmaker.  He surpassed his rival Sir Joshua Reynolds to become the dominant British portraitist of the second half of the 18th century.  He painted quickly, and the works of his maturity are characterised by a light palette and easy strokes.  He preferred landscapes to portraits, and is credited (with Richard Wilson) as the originator of the 18th-century British landscape school.  Gainsborough was a founding member of the Royal Academy.  Youth and trainingHe was born in Sudbury, Suffolk, the youngest son of John Gainsborough, a weaver and maker of woollen goods, and his wife, the sister of the Reverend Humphry Burroughs. 

Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands<====>31127<====>Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands The Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI) was a United Nations trust territory in Micronesia (western Pacific) administered by the United States from 1947 to 1986. HistorySpain initially claimed the islands that later comprised the territory of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI).  Encyclopædia Britannica: Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands  Subsequently, Germany established competing claims over the islands.   The competing claims were eventually resolved in favor of Germany when Spain, following its loss of several possessions to the United States during the Spanish–American War, ceded its claims over the islands to Germany in 1899 pursuant to the German–Spanish Treaty (1899). 

Theobromine<====>31128<====>Theobromine  Theobromine, formerly known as xantheose,  is a bitter alkaloid of the cacao plant, with the chemical formula C 7 H 8 N 4 O 2 .   It is found in chocolate, as well as in a number of other foods, including the leaves of the tea plant, and the kola (or cola) nut.  It is classified as a xanthine alkaloid,    which also include the similar compounds theophylline and caffeine.    The compounds differ in that caffeine has an extra methyl group (see under Pharmacology section). Despite its name, the compound contains no bromine—theobromine is derived from Theobroma, the name of the genus of the cacao tree, (which itself is made up of the Greek roots theo ("god") and broma ("food"), meaning "food of the gods"   (note: the book incorrectly states that the name "theobroma" is derived from Latin) ) with the suffix -ine given to alkaloids and other basic nitrogen-containing compounds.

The Goodies<====>31139<====>The Goodies    The Goodies are a trio of British comedians: Tim Brooke-Taylor, Graeme Garden, and Bill Oddie.  They wrote for and performed in their eponymous surreal Television comedy show during the 1970s and early 1980s, combining sketches and situation comedy. BeginningsThe three actors met each other as undergraduates at Cambridge University, where Brooke-Taylor was studying law, Garden was studying medicine, and Oddie was studying English.  Their contemporaries included Graham Chapman, John Cleese, and Eric Idle, who later became members of Monty Python, and with whom they became close friends.  Brooke-Taylor and Cleese studied together and swapped lecture notes as they were both law students, but at different colleges within the university. 

Divine Comedy<====>31140<====>Divine Comedy    The Divine Comedy (   ) is a long narrative poem by Dante Alighieri, begun c.  1308 and completed in 1320, a year before his death in 1321.  It is widely considered to be the preeminent work in Italian literature  and one of the greatest works of world literature.   The poem's imaginative vision of the afterlife is representative of the medieval world-view as it had developed in the Western Church by the 14th century.  It helped establish the Tuscan language, in which it is written, as the standardized Italian language. 

Transport for London<====>31145<====>Transport for London    Transport for London (TfL) is a local government body responsible for the transport system in Greater London, England.Its head office is in Windsor House in the City of Westminster.  TfL has responsibility for London's network of principal road routes, for various rail networks including the London Underground, London Overground, Docklands Light Railway and TfL Rail, for London's trams, buses and taxis, for cycling provision, and for river services.  The underlying services are provided by a mixture of wholly owned subsidiary companies (principally London Underground), by private sector franchisees (the remaining rail services, trams and most buses) and by licensees (some buses, taxis and river services). 

Transfer function<====>31146<====>Transfer function In engineering, a transfer function (also known as system function  or network function) of an electronic or control system component is a mathematical function giving the corresponding output value for each possible value of the input to the device. It is often represented as a graph, called a transfer curve or characteristic curve.   The transfer function provides information which specifies the behavior of the component in a system, and is used in the mathematical analysis of systems, particularly using the block diagram technique, in electronics and control theory. 

Twiglets<====>31149<====>Twiglets  Twiglets are a wheat-based snack  with a "distinctive knobbly shape" similar to that of a small twig.  The taste of Twiglets derives from the yeast extract used in its coating, and has been compared to that of Marmite.   They are marketed in the United Kingdom and packaged in 24g, 45g, 105g and 150g bags, and in 200g tubs. HistoryTwiglets were invented in 1929  by a French biscuit maker named J.  Rondalin,    a technical manager at Peek Freans' Bermondsey factory, who added brewer's yeast to a leftover batch of Vitawheat dough. 

Lagrange's theorem (group theory)<====>31150<====>Lagrange's theorem (group theory) Lagrange's theorem, in the mathematics of group theory, states that for any finite group G, the order (number of elements) of every subgroup H of G divides the order of G.   The theorem is named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange. Proof of Lagrange's theoremThis can be shown using the concept of left cosets of H in G.  The left cosets are the equivalence classes of a certain equivalence relation on G and therefore form a partition of G.  Specifically, x and y in G are related if and only if there exists h in H such that x = yh. 

The Princess Bride (film)<====>31153<====>The Princess Bride (film)  The Princess Bride is a 1987 American romantic comedy fantasy adventure film directed and co-produced by Rob Reiner, and starring Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin, Chris Sarandon, Wallace Shawn, André the Giant and Christopher Guest.  Adapted by William Goldman from his 1973 novel of the same name, it tells the story of a farmhand named Westley, accompanied by befriended companions along the way, who must rescue his true love Princess Buttercup from the odious Prince Humperdinck.  The film effectively preserves the novel's narrative style by presenting the story as a book being read by a grandfather (Peter Falk) to his sick grandson (Fred Savage). 

Taxil hoax<====>31155<====>Taxil hoax The Taxil hoax was an 1890s hoax of exposure by Léo Taxil intended to mock not only Freemasonry but also the Catholic Church's opposition to it.    Taxil and FreemasonryLéo Taxil was the pen name of Marie Joseph Gabriel Antoine Jogand-Pagès, who had been accused earlier of libel regarding a book he wrote called The Secret Loves of Pope Pius IX.  On April 20, 1884, Pope Leo XIII published an encyclical, Humanum genus, that said that the human race was After this encyclical, Taxil underwent a public, feigned conversion to Roman Catholicism and announced his intention of repairing the damage he had done to the true faith. 

Taiwan independence movement<====>31156<====>Taiwan independence movement    Taiwan independence movement is a political movement to pursue formal independence of Taiwan, Goals for independence have arisen from international law in relation to the 1952 Treaty of San Francisco. Supporters contend that when Japan renounced all rights to the island of Taiwan and Penghu in 1945, it did not specify the successor state.  Consequently, the sovereignty of the two territories should be determined by Taiwanese people through self-determination and referendums in Taiwan. Taiwan independence is supported by the Pan-Green Coalition in Taiwan, but opposed by the Pan-Blue Coalition which seeks to retain the somewhat ambiguous status quo of the Republic of China (ROC) under the 1992 consensus, or gradually reunify with mainland China at some point. 

Trident (missile)<====>31158<====>Trident (missile)  The Trident missile is a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) equipped with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV).  Originally developed by Lockheed Missiles and Space Corporation, the missile is armed with thermonuclear warheads and is launched from nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs).  Trident missiles are carried by fourteen US Navy  s, with American warheads, and four Royal Navy  s, with British warheads.  The missile is named after the mythological trident of Neptune.  DevelopmentIn 1971, the US Navy began studies of an advanced Undersea Long-range Missile System (ULMS).  A Decision Coordinating Paper (DCP) for the ULMS was approved on 14 September 1971.

Tsunami<====>31161<====>Tsunami A tsunami (from  , "harbour wave"; English pronunciation:) or tidal wave, also known as a seismic sea wave, is a series of waves in a water body caused by the displacement of a large volume of water, generally in an ocean or a large lake.   Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and other underwater explosions (including detonations of underwater nuclear devices), landslides, glacier calvings, meteorite impacts and other disturbances above or below water all have the potential to generate a tsunami.   Unlike normal ocean waves, which are generated by wind, or tides, which are generated by the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun, a tsunami is generated by the displacement of water. 

Tower of London<====>31165<====>Tower of London    The Tower of London, officially Her Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress of the Tower of London, is a   historic  castle located on the north bank of the River Thames in central London.  It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill.  It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest of England.  The White Tower, which gives the entire castle its name, was built by William the Conqueror in 1078 and was a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite.

Tobin tax<====>31175<====>Tobin tax   A Tobin tax, suggested by Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences Laureate economist James Tobin, was originally defined as a tax on all spot conversions of one currency into another.  Tobin's original tax was intended to put a penalty on short-term financial round-trip excursions into another currency.   By the late 1990s, however, the term Tobin tax was being incorrectly used to describe all forms of short term transaction taxation, whether across currencies or not – another term for these broader tax schemes is Robin Hood tax due to tax revenues from the (presumably richer) speculator funding general revenue (of whom the primary beneficiaries are poorer). 

The Parent Trap (1961 film)<====>31176<====>The Parent Trap (1961 film) The Parent Trap is a 1961 Walt Disney Technicolor film.    It stars Hayley Mills, Maureen O'Hara and Brian Keith in a story about teenage twins on a quest to reunite their divorced parents.  The screenplay by the film's director David Swift    was based upon the 1949 book Lottie and Lisa (German:  ) by Erich Kästner.    The Parent Trap was nominated for two Academy Awards, was broadcast on television, saw three television sequels, was remade in 1998 with Lindsay Lohan, and has been released on digital stereo LaserDisc format in 1986 as well as VHS and DVD in 2000. 

Torpoint Ferry<====>31177<====>Torpoint Ferry  The Torpoint Ferry is a car and pedestrian chain ferry, connecting the A374 road which crosses the Hamoaze, a stretch of water at the mouth of the River Tamar, between Devonport in Plymouth and Torpoint in Cornwall.  The service was established in 1791 and chain ferry operations were introduced by James Meadows Rendel in 1832. Current operationsThe route is currently served by three ferries, named after three rivers in the area:  Tamar II, Lynher II and Plym II.  Each ferry carries 73 cars and operates using its own set of slipways and parallel chains, with a vehicle weight limit of   The ferry boats are propelled across the river by pulling themselves on the chains; the chains then sink to the bottom to allow shipping movements in the river. 

Tarot<====>31178<====>Tarot   The tarot ( ; first known as trionfi and later as tarocchi, tarock, and others) is a pack of playing cards, used from the mid-15th century in various parts of Europe to play games such as Italian tarocchini and French tarot.  In the late 18th century, it began to be used for divination in the form of tarotology and cartomancy. Like common playing cards, the tarot has four suits (which vary by region: French suits in Northern Europe, Latin suits in Southern Europe, and German suits in Central Europe).   Each suit has 14 cards, ten cards numbering from one (or Ace) to ten and four face cards (King, Queen, Knight, and Jack/Knave). 

Thuban<====>31180<====>Thuban Thuban, also designated Alpha Draconis (α Draconis, abbreviated Alpha Dra, α Dra), is a star (or star system) in the constellation of Draco.  A relatively inconspicuous star in the night sky of the Northern Hemisphere, it is historically significant as having been the north pole star from the 4th to 2nd millennium BC. Even though Johann Bayer gave Thuban the designation Alpha, its apparent magnitude of 3. 65 means it is 3. 7 times fainter than the brightest star in the constellation, Gamma Draconis (Eltanin), whose apparent magnitude is 2. 

Toyotomi Hideyoshi<====>31182<====>Toyotomi Hideyoshiwas a preeminent daimyō, warrior, general, samurai, and politician of the Sengoku period  who is regarded as Japan's second "great unifier".  Richard Holmes, The World Atlas of Warfare: Military Innovations that Changed the Course of History, Viking Press 1988.  p.  68.   He succeeded his former liege lord, Oda Nobunaga, and brought an end to the Warring States period.   The period of his rule is often called the Momoyama period, named after Hideyoshi's castle.  After his death, his young son Hideyori was displaced by Tokugawa Ieyasu. 

Tokugawa Ieyasu<====>31183<====>Tokugawa Ieyasu    was the founder and first shogun of the Tokugawa shogunate of Japan, which effectively ruled Japan from the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 until the Meiji Restoration in 1868.  Ieyasu seized power in 1600, received appointment as shogun in 1603, and abdicated from office in 1605, but remained in power until his death in 1616.  His given name is sometimes spelled Iyeyasu,   according to the historical pronunciation of the kana character he.  Ieyasu was posthumously enshrined at Nikkō Tōshō-gū with the name  .  He was one of the three unifiers of Japan, along with his former lord Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi. 

Tonne<====>31185<====>Tonne  The tonne ( ) (non-preferred SI derived unit; SI symbol: t), commonly referred to as the metric ton in the United States, is a non-SI metric unit of mass equal to 1,000 kilograms;  Table 6  .  BIPM.  Retrieved on 2011-07-10.  or one megagram (Mg); it is equivalent to approximately   pounds, or 0. 984 long tons (imperial).  Although not part of the SI per se, the tonne is "accepted for use with" SI units and prefixes by the International Committee for Weights and Measures, along with several other units like the bar, litre and day. 

TrueType<====>31187<====>TrueType TrueType is an outline font standard developed by Apple and Microsoft in the late 1980s as a competitor to Adobe's Type 1 fonts used in PostScript.   It has become the most common format for fonts on the classic Mac OS, macOS, and Microsoft Windows operating systems.  The primary strength of TrueType was originally that it offered font developers a high degree of control over precisely how their fonts are displayed, right down to particular pixels, at various font sizes.  With widely varying rendering technologies in use today, pixel-level control is no longer certain in a TrueType font. 

Triassic–Jurassic extinction event<====>31188<====>Triassic–Jurassic extinction event The Triassic–Jurassic extinction event marks the boundary between the Triassic and Jurassic periods,  ,  and is one of the major extinction events of the Phanerozoic eon, profoundly affecting life on land and in the oceans.   In the seas, a whole class (conodonts)  and 34% of marine genera disappeared.   On land, all archosaurs other than crocodylomorphs (Sphenosuchia and Crocodyliformes) and Avemetatarsalia (pterosaurs and dinosaurs), some remaining therapsids, and many of the large amphibians became extinct. EffectsAt least half of the species now known to have been living on Earth at that time became extinct. 

Tufted puffin<====>31190<====>Tufted puffin The tufted puffin (Fratercula cirrhata), also known as crested puffin, is a relatively abundant medium-sized pelagic seabird in the auk family (Alcidae) found throughout the North Pacific Ocean. It is one of three species of puffin that make up the genus Fratercula and is easily recognizable by its thick red bill and yellow tufts.  DescriptionTufted puffins are around   in length with a similar wingspan and weigh about three quarters of a kilogram (1. 6 lbs).    Birds from the western Pacific population are somewhat larger than those from the eastern Pacific, and male birds tend to be slightly larger than females. 

THX 1138<====>31193<====>THX 1138   THX 1138 is a 1971 American science fiction film set in a dystopian future in which the populace is controlled through android police and mandatory use of drugs that suppress emotions.  It was directed by George Lucas in his feature film directorial debut in 1971.  Produced by Francis Ford Coppola and written by Lucas and Walter Murch, it stars Donald Pleasence and Robert Duvall. THX 1138 was developed from Lucas's student film Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB, which he made in 1967 while attending the USC School of Cinematic Arts.  The feature film was produced in a joint venture between Warner Bros. 

Tuning fork<====>31198<====>Tuning forkA tuning fork is an acoustic resonator in the form of a two-pronged fork with the prongs (tines) formed from a U-shaped bar of elastic metal (usually steel).  It resonates at a specific constant pitch when set vibrating by striking it against a surface or with an object, and emits a pure musical tone once the high overtones die out.  The pitch that a particular tuning fork generates depends on the length and mass of the two prongs.  It is frequently used as a standard of pitch to tune musical instruments. The tuning fork was invented in 1711 by British musician John Shore, Sergeant Trumpeter and Lutenist to the court. 

Trireme<====>31199<====>Trireme  A trireme ( ; derived from Latin: trirēmis  "with three banks of oars";   triērēs,  literally "three-rower") was an ancient vessel and a type of galley that was used by the ancient maritime civilizations of the Mediterranean, especially the Phoenicians, ancient Greeks and Romans.  The trireme derives its name from its three rows of oars, manned with one man per oar.  The early trireme was a development of the penteconter, an ancient warship with a single row of 25 oars on each side (i. e. , a single-banked boat), and of the bireme ( , diērēs), a warship with two banks of oars, of Phoenician origin. 

Tertullian<====>31204<====>TertullianTertullian ( ), full name Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus, c.  155 – c.  240 AD,  was a prolific early Christian author from Carthage in the Roman province of Africa.   Of Berber origin, he was the first Christian author to produce an extensive corpus of Latin Christian literature.  He also was an early Christian apologist and a polemicist against heresy, including contemporary Christian Gnosticism.   Tertullian has been called "the father of Latin Christianity"   and "the founder of Western theology. "   Though conservative in his worldview, Tertullian originated new theological concepts and advanced the development of early Church doctrine. 

Traveling Wilburys<====>31206<====>Traveling Wilburys   The Traveling Wilburys (sometimes shortened to the Wilburys) were a British-American supergroup consisting of Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty.  The band recorded two albums, the first in 1988 and the second in 1990, though Orbison died before the second was recorded. The project's work received much anticipation given the diverse nature of the singer-songwriters.  Their debut album Traveling Wilburys Vol.  1 proved an enduring critical success, in 1989 and 1990 winning accolades such as a Grammy for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group. HistoryBackground George Harrison first mentioned the Traveling Wilburys publicly during a radio interview with Bob Coburn on the show Rockline in February 1988. 

Tumor suppressor gene<====>31207<====>Tumor suppressor geneA tumor suppressor gene, or antioncogene, is a gene that protects a cell from one step on the path to cancer.  When this gene mutates to cause a loss or reduction in its function, the cell can progress to cancer, usually in combination with other genetic changes.  The loss of these genes may be even more important than proto-oncogene/oncogene activation for the formation of many kinds of human cancer cells.   Tumor suppressor genes can be grouped into categories including caretaker genes, gatekeeper genes, and landscaper genes; the classification schemes are evolving as medicine advances, learning from fields including molecular biology, genetics, and epigenetics. 

The Angry Brigade<====>31208<====>The Angry Brigade   The Angry Brigade was a left-wing revolutionary group responsible for a series of bomb attacks in England between 1970 and 1972. HistoryOriginsIn mid-1968 demonstrations took place in London, centred on the US embassy in Grosvenor Square, against US involvement in the Vietnam War.  One of the organisers of these demonstrations, the well-known radical Tariq Ali, has said he recalls an approach by someone representing the Angry Brigade who wished to bomb the embassy; he told them it was a terrible idea and no bombing took place.  1970sThe Angry Brigade decided to launch a bombing campaign with small bombs – in order to maximise media exposure to their demands while keeping collateral damage to a minimum. 

Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem<====>31211<====>Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem In mathematics, specifically in real analysis, the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem, named after Bernard Bolzano and Karl Weierstrass, is a fundamental result about convergence in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space R n .   The theorem states that each bounded sequence in R n  has a convergent subsequence.    An equivalent formulation is that a subset of R n  is sequentially compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.   The theorem is sometimes called the sequential compactness theorem.  History and SignificanceThe Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem is named after mathematicians Bernard Bolzano and Karl Weierstrass. 

Tabula rasa<====>31212<====>Tabula rasaTabula rasa ( ) refers to the epistemological idea that individuals are born without built-in mental content and that therefore all knowledge comes from experience or perception.  Proponents of tabula rasa generally disagree with the doctrine of innatism which holds that the mind is born already in possession of certain knowledge.  Generally, proponents of the tabula rasa theory also favour the "nurture" side of the nature versus nurture debate when it comes to aspects of one's personality, social and emotional behaviour, knowledge and sapience. HistoryTabula rasa is a Latin phrase often translated as "blank slate" in English and originates from the Roman tabula used for notes, which was blanked by heating the wax and then smoothing it. 

Tsurugi (sword)<====>31216<====>Tsurugi (sword)  A   is a Japanese sword, akin to the jian Chinese sword.

Typography<====>31217<====>Typography   Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed.  The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing (leading), and letter-spacing (tracking), and adjusting the space between pairs of letters (kerning ).  The term typography is also applied to the style, arrangement, and appearance of the letters, numbers, and symbols created by the process.  Type design is a closely related craft, sometimes considered part of typography; most typographers do not design typefaces, and some type designers do not consider themselves typographers. 

Template (C++)<====>31218<====>Template (C++)  Templates are a feature of the C++ programming language that allows functions and classes to operate with generic types.   This allows a function or class to work on many different data types without being rewritten for each one. Templates are of great utility to programmers in C++, especially when combined with multiple inheritance and operator overloading.  The C++ Standard Library provides many useful functions within a framework of connected templates. Major inspirations for C++ templates were the parameterized modules provided by CLU and the generics provided by Ada.    Technical overviewThere are three kinds of templates: function templates, class templates and, since C++14, variable templates. 

Theoderic the Great<====>31222<====>Theoderic the Great Theoderic the Great ( ;  ;  ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ; 454 – August 30, 526 AD), often referred to as Theodoric, was king of the Ostrogoths (475–526),  ruler of Italy (493–526), regent of the Visigoths (511–526), and a patricius of the Roman Empire.  His Gothic name, which is reconstructed by linguists as *Þiudareiks, translates into "people-king" or "ruler of the people".  Theodoric was born in Pannonia in 454, after his people had defeated the Huns at the Battle of Nedao.  His father was King Theodemir, a Germanic Amali nobleman, and his mother was Ereleuva. 

Randolph (ship)<====>31225<====>Randolph (ship) }   Randolph was a 664-ton ship-rigged merchant vessel constructed in 1849 in Sunderland.  She was one of the First Four Ships to settle Christchurch, New Zealand (the other three were Cressy, Sir George Seymour and Charlotte Jane). Randolph  left Gravesend on 4 September 1850, and Plymouth on the night of 7 September 1850.  The ship was chartered by the Canterbury Association, with Captain William Dale serving as the ship's captain.  She arrived at Lyttelton 99 days later on 16 December 1850, with 34 cabin passengers, 15 intermediate and 161 steerage passengers.    She was lost on 25 June 1851, on a reef off Amber Island (Mapon). 

Truth serum<====>31231<====>Truth serum "Truth serum" is a colloquial name for any of a range of psychoactive drugs used in an effort to obtain information from subjects who are unable or unwilling to provide it otherwise.  These include ethanol, scopolamine, 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate, midazolam, flunitrazepam, sodium thiopental, and amobarbital, among others. Although a variety of such substances have been tested, serious issues have been raised about their use scientifically, ethically and legally.  There is currently no drug proven to cause consistent or predictable enhancement of truth-telling.   Subjects questioned under the influence of such substances have been found to be suggestible and their memories subject to reconstruction and fabrication. 

Tripoli<====>31232<====>Tripoli    Tripoli ( ,  ; Berber:"Oea" or "Wy't" ) is the capital city and the largest city of Libya.

Tripoli includes the Port of Tripoli and the country's largest commercial and manufacturing centre.  It is also the site of the University of Tripoli.  The vast Bab al-Azizia barracks, which includes the former family estate of Muammar Gaddafi, is also located in the city. 

Tower of Babel<====>31235<====>Tower of Babel   The Tower of Babel ( , Migdal Bāḇēl) as told in Genesis 11:1-9 is an origin myth meant to explain why the world's peoples speak different languages.    According to the story, a united humanity in the generations following the Great Flood, speaking a single language and migrating eastward, comes to the land of Shinar ( ).  There they agree to build a city and a tower tall enough to reach heaven.  God, observing their city and tower, confounds their speech so that they can no longer understand each other, and scatters them around the world.

Tomahawk (missile)<====>31238<====>Tomahawk (missile)  The Tomahawk (  or  ) Land Attack Missile (TLAM) is a long-range, all-weather, subsonic cruise missile that is primarily used by the United States Navy and Royal Navy in ship and submarine-based land-attack operations.  Introduced by General Dynamics in the 1970s, it was initially designed as a medium-range to long-range, low-altitude missile that could be launched from a surface platform.  Since then, it has been upgraded several times with guidance systems for precision navigation.  From 1992-1994, McDonnell Douglas Corporation was the sole supplier of Tomahawk Missiles and produced Block II and Block III Tomahawk missiles and remanufactured many Tomahawks to Block III specifications. 

Trigun<====>31241<====>Trigun    is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yasuhiro Nightow.  The manga was serialized in Tokuma Shoten's Shōnen Captain in 1995 with three collected volumes when the magazine was discontinued in 1997.  The series continued in Shōnen Gahosha's Young King Ours magazine, under the title  , where it remained until finishing in 2008. Both manga were adapted into an anime television series in 1998.  Madhouse animated the TV series which aired on TV Tokyo from April 1, 1998 to September 30, 1998, totaling 26 episodes.

Teleprinter<====>31247<====>Teleprinter   A teleprinter (teletypewriter, Teletype or TTY) is an electromechanical typewriter that can be used to send and receive typed messages through various communications channels, in both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint configurations.  The machines were adapted to provide a user interface to early mainframe computers and minicomputers, sending typed data to the computer and printing the response.  Some models could also be used to create punched tape for data storage (either from typed input or from data received from a remote source) and to read back such tape for local printing or transmission. Teleprinters could use a variety of different communication media. 

Travelling salesman problem<====>31248<====>Travelling salesman problem  The travelling salesman problem  (TSP) asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?" It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in operations research and theoretical computer science. The travelling purchaser problem and the vehicle routing problem are both generalizations of TSP. In the theory of computational complexity, the decision version of the TSP (where, given a length L, the task is to decide whether the graph has any tour shorter than L) belongs to the class of NP-complete problems. 

Total Access Communication System<====>31249<====>Total Access Communication System  Total Access Communication System (TACS) and ETACS are mostly-obsolete variants of Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS) which was announced as the choice for the first two UK national cellular systems in Feb 1983, less than a year after the UK government announced the T&Cs for the two competing mobile phone networks in June 1982.    Vodafone (known then as Racal-Vodafone) opted for a £30 million turnkey contract    from Ericsson (ERA) to design, build and set up its initial network of 100 base station sites.    Cellnet (then known Telecom Securicor Cellular Radio Ltd) used development labs in the facilities at General Electric (later made part of Motorola) based at Lynchburg, Virginia, USA. 

Time-division multiple access<====>31250<====>Time-division multiple access  Time-division multiple access (TDMA) is a channel access method for shared-medium networks.  It allows several users to share the same frequency channel by dividing the signal into different time slots.The users transmit in rapid succession, one after the other, each using its own time slot.   This allows multiple stations to share the same transmission medium (e. g.  radio frequency channel) while using only a part of its channel capacity.  TDMA is used in the digital 2G cellular systems such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), IS-136, Personal Digital Cellular (PDC) and iDEN, and in the Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) standard for portable phones. 

The Prisoner<====>31253<====>The Prisoner    The Prisoner is a 17-episode British television series    first broadcast in Canada beginning on 6 September 1967 then in the United Kingdom on 29 September 1967 and in the United States on 1 June 1968.It stars and was co-created by Patrick McGoohan, and combines spy fiction with elements of science fiction, allegory and psychological drama.  The series follows a British former secret agent who is abducted and imprisoned in a mysterious coastal village resort, where his captors try to find out why he abruptly resigned from his job. 

Theseus<====>31255<====>Theseus   Theseus ( ,  ;    ) was the mythical king and founder-hero of Athens.  Like Perseus, Cadmus, or Heracles, Theseus battled and overcame foes that were identified with an archaic religious and social order: “This was a major cultural transition, like the making of the new Olympia by Hercules” (Ruck & Staples, p.  204).  Theseus was a founding hero for the Athenians in the same way that Heracles was the founding hero for the Dorians.  The Athenians regarded Theseus as a great reformer; his name comes from the same root as   (thesmos), Greek for "The Gathering". 

Tax law<====>31256<====>Tax law   Tax law is an area of legal study dealing with the constitutional, common-law, statutory, tax treaty, and regulatory rules that constitute the law applicable to taxation. Major issuesPrimary taxation issues facing the governments world over include;Taxes on income and wealth (or estates). Taxation of capital gains versus labor income.  Ecotax  (short for Ecological taxation) refers to taxes intended to promote environmentally friendly activities via economic incentives. Tax evasion and avoidance leading to reduced government revenue. Due to an Inefficient tax system in many underdeveloped countries, the majority of small businesses are not taxed. Education In law schools, "tax law" is a sub-discipline and area of specialist study. 

Tadoma<====>31257<====>TadomaTadoma is a method of communication used by deafblind  individuals,  in which the deafblind person places their thumb on the speaker's lips and their fingers along the jawline.  The middle three fingers often fall along the speaker's cheeks with the little finger picking up the vibrations of the speaker's throat.  It is sometimes referred to as 'tactile lipreading', as the deafblind person feels the movement of the lips, as well as vibrations of the vocal cords, puffing of the cheeks and the warm air produced by nasal sounds such as 'N' and 'M'.   There are variations in the hand positioning, and it is a method sometimes used by people to support their remaining hearing. 

Toruń<====>31258<====>Toruń   Toruń   ( ) is a city in northern Poland, on the Vistula River.   Its population was 202,591 as of June 2016.   Previously it was the capital of the Toruń Voivodeship (1975–98) and the Pomeranian Voivodeship (1921–45).  Since 1999, Toruń has been a seat of the self-government of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship and, as such, is one of its two capitals (together with Bydgoszcz).  The cities and neighboring counties form the Bydgoszcz-Toruń twin city metropolitan area. Toruń is one of the oldest cities in Poland, with the first settlement dated back to the 8th century and later having been expanded in 1233 by the Teutonic Knights.

GeographyThe Tigris is 1,750 km long, rising in the Taurus Mountains of eastern Turkey about 25 km southeast of the city of Elazig and about 30 km from the headwaters of the Euphrates. 

Titration<====>31260<====>Titration  Titration, also known as titrimetry,    is a common laboratory method of quantitative chemical analysis that is used to determine the unknown concentration of an identified analyte.  Since volume measurements play a key role in titration, it is also known as volumetric analysis.  A reagent, called the titrant or titrator    is prepared as a standard solution.   A known concentration and volume of titrant reacts with a solution of analyte or titrand    to determine concentration.  The volume of titrant reacted is called titration volume. History and etymologyThe word "titration" descends from the French word tiltre (1543), meaning the "proportion of gold or silver in coins or in works of gold or silver"; i. 

Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star<====>31261<====>Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star    "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" is a popular English lullaby.  The lyrics are from an early 19th-century English poem by Jane Taylor, "The Star".  The poem, which is in couplet form, was first published in 1806 in Rhymes for the Nursery, a collection of poems by Taylor and her sister Ann.  It is sung to the tune of the French melody Ah! vous dirai-je, maman, which was published in 1761 and later arranged by several composers including Mozart with Twelve Variations on "Ah vous dirai-je, Maman".   The English lyrics have five stanzas, although only the first is widely known.

Although not especially well known outside the film world, he has composed for numerous films and his music has been critically acclaimed for both its depth and emotion. CareerAt the age of six, Jones already had decided to become a film composer.  In 1967 he attended the Royal Academy of Music in London with a scholarship and afterwards worked for five years for the BBC on reviews of radio and television music.  In 1974 Jones attended the University of York from which he graduated with a master's degree in Film and Media Music. 

Tocharian languages<====>31273<====>Tocharian languages Tocharian,  also spelled Tokharian (  or  ), is an extinct branch of the Indo-European language family.  It is known from manuscripts dating from the 6th to the 8th century AD, which were found in oasis cities on the northern edge of the Tarim Basin (now part of Xinjiang in northwest China).  The discovery of these languages in the early 20th century contradicted the formerly prevalent idea of an east–west division of Indo-European language family on the centum–satem isogloss, and contributed to re-invigorate study of the family.  Identifying the authors with the Tokharoi people of ancient Bactria (Tokharistan), early authors called these languages "Tocharian". 

Trie<====>31274<====>Trie  In computer science, a trie, also called digital tree and sometimes radix tree or prefix tree (as they can be searched by prefixes), is a kind of search tree—an ordered tree data structure that is used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings.  Unlike a binary search tree, no node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; instead, its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated.  All the descendants of a node have a common prefix of the string associated with that node, and the root is associated with the empty string. 

The Age of Reason<====>31275<====>The Age of Reason   The Age of Reason; Being an Investigation of True and Fabulous Theology is a work by English and American political activist Thomas Paine, arguing for the philosophical position of Deism.  It follows in the tradition of eighteenth-century British deism, and challenges institutionalized religion and the legitimacy of the Bible.  It was published in three parts in 1794, 1795, and 1807.  It was a best-seller in the United States, where it caused a short-lived deistic revival.  British audiences, however, fearing increased political radicalism as a result of the French Revolution, received it with more hostility. 

The Bell Curve<====>31277<====>The Bell Curve  The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life is a 1994 book by Harvard psychologist Richard J.  Herrnstein and political scientist Charles Murray, in which the authors argue that human intelligence is substantially influenced by both inherited and environmental factors and that it is a better predictor of many personal dynamics, including financial income, job performance, birth out of wedlock, and involvement in crime than are an individual's parental socioeconomic status.  They also argue that those with high intelligence, the "cognitive elite", are becoming separated from those of average and below-average intelligence. 

House of Tudor<====>31278<====>House of Tudor  The House of Tudor was an English royal house of Welsh origin,  descended in the male line from the Tudors of Penmynydd.  Tudor monarchs ruled the Kingdom of England and its realms, including their ancestral Wales and the Lordship of Ireland (later the Kingdom of Ireland) from 1485 until 1603, with five monarchs in that period.  The Tudors succeeded the House of Plantagenet as rulers of the Kingdom of England, and were succeeded by the House of Stuart.  The first Tudor monarch, Henry VII, descended through his mother from a legitimised branch of the English royal House of Lancaster. 

Typee<====>31279<====>Typee Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life is the first book by American writer Herman Melville, published first in London, then New York, in 1846.  Considered a classic in travel and adventure literature, the narrative is partly based on the author's actual experiences on the island Nuku Hiva in the South Pacific Marquesas Islands in 1842, liberally supplemented with imaginative reconstruction and adaptation of material from other books.  The title is from the province Tai Pi Vai.  Typee was Melville's most popular work during his lifetime; it made him notorious as the "man who lived among the cannibals". 

Truncated icosahedron<====>31282<====>Truncated icosahedron In geometry, the truncated icosahedron is an Archimedean solid, one of 13 convex isogonal nonprismatic solids whose faces are two or more types of regular polygons. It has 12 regular pentagonal faces, 20 regular hexagonal faces, 60 vertices and 90 edges. It is the Goldberg polyhedron GP V (1,1) or {5+,3} 1,1 , containing pentagonal and hexagonal faces. This geometry is associated with footballs (soccer balls) typically patterned with white hexagons and black pentagons.  Geodesic domes such as those whose architecture Buckminster Fuller pioneered are often based on this structure.   It also corresponds to the geometry of the fullerene C 60  ("buckyball") molecule. 

The Mismeasure of Man<====>31283<====>The Mismeasure of Man The Mismeasure of Man is a 1981 book by Harvard paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould.  Gould, S.  J.  (1981).  The Mismeasure of Man.  New York: W.  W.  Norton & Company.   The book is both a history and critique of the statistical methods and cultural motivations underlying biological determinism, the belief that "the social and economic differences between human groups—primarily races, classes, and sexes—arise from inherited, inborn distinctions and that society, in this sense, is an accurate reflection of biology".  Gould, S.  J.  (1981).  The Mismeasure of Man, p. 

Taliban treatment of women<====>31285<====>Taliban treatment of womenWhile in power in Afghanistan, the Taliban became notorious internationally mostly for their apparent sexism and misogyny.  With regards to claims of sexism and misogyny made by various quarters; the stated aim of the Taliban, in respect to their contentious and non-contentious treatment of women, was to create a "secure environment where the chastity and dignity of women may once again be sacrosanct", Nancy Hatch Dupree.

Theft<====>31287<====>TheftIn common usage, theft is the taking of another person's property or services without that person's permission or consent with the intent to deprive the rightful owner of it.    Criminal Law – Cases and Materials, 7th ed.  2012, Wolters Kluwer Law & Business; John Kaplan, Robert Weisberg, Guyora Binder,  , [1]   The word is also used as an informal shorthand term for some crimes against property, such as burglary, embezzlement, larceny, looting, robbery, shoplifting, library theft, and fraud (that is, obtaining money under false pretenses). 

Thomas Bowdler<====>31291<====>Thomas Bowdler    Thomas Bowdler, LRCP, FRS ( ; 11 July 1754 – 24 February 1825) was an English physician best known for publishing The Family Shakspeare, an expurgated edition of William Shakespeare's work.  The work, edited by his sister Henrietta Maria Bowdler, was intended to provide a version of Shakespeare that was more appropriate for 19th century women and children than the original. The eponymous verb bowdlerise (or bowdlerize)  has associated his name with the censorship of elements deemed inappropriate for children, not only of literature but also of motion pictures  and television programmes. 

Treason<====>31292<====>Treason In law, treason is the crime that covers some of the more extreme acts against one's nation or sovereign.   Historically, treason also covered the murder of specific social superiors, such as the murder of a husband by his wife or that of a master by his servant.  Treason against the king was known as high treason and treason against a lesser superior was petty treason.  A person who commits treason is known in law as a traitor. At times, the term traitor has been used as a political epithet, regardless of any verifiable treasonable action. 

Type VII submarine<====>31294<====>Type VII submarine }   Type VII U-boats were the most common type of German World War II U-boat.  U-boat stands for Unterseeboot, which means submarine in German. Conception and productionThe Type VII was based on earlier German submarine designs going back to the World War I Type UB III and especially the cancelled Type UG, designed through the Dutch dummy company Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw Den Haag (I. v. S) which was set up by Germany after World War I in order to maintain and develop German submarine technology and to circumvent the limitations set by the Treaty of Versailles, and was built by shipyards around the world. 

Three-age system<====>31295<====>Three-age system The three-age system is the categorization of history into time periods divisible by three; for example, the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age, although it also refers to other tripartite divisions of historic time periods.  In history, archaeology and physical anthropology, the three-age system is a methodological concept adopted during the 19th century by which artifacts and events of late prehistory and early history could be ordered into a recognizable chronology.  It was initially developed by C.  J.  Thomsen, director of the Royal Museum of Nordic Antiquities, Copenhagen, as a means to classify the museum’s collections according to whether the artifacts were made of stone, bronze, or iron. 

Tachyon<====>31296<====>Tachyon A  tachyon   or tachyonic particle is a hypothetical particle that always moves faster than light.   Most physicists believe that faster-than-light particles cannot exist because they are not consistent with the known laws of physics.If such particles did exist, they could be used to build a tachyonic antitelephone and send signals faster than light, which (according to special relativity) would lead to violations of causality.  The possibility of particles moving faster than light was first proposed by O.  M.  P.  Bilaniuk, V.  K.  Deshpande, and E. 

The Starlost<====>31298<====>The Starlost The Starlost is a Canadian-produced science fiction television series created by writer Harlan Ellison and broadcast in 1973 on CTV in Canada and syndicated to local stations in the United States.  The show's setting is a huge generational colony spacecraft called Earthship Ark, which has gone off course.  Many of the descendants of the original crew and colonists are unaware, however, that they are aboard a ship.  The series experienced a number of production difficulties, and Ellison broke with the project before the airing of its first episode.   PremiseForeseeing the destruction of the Earth, humanity builds a multi-generational starship called Earthship Ark,   wide and   long. 

Tora Bora<====>31300<====>Tora Bora  Tora Bora ( , "Black Cave") is a cave complex, part of the Spīn Ghar mountain range of eastern Afghanistan.  It is situated in the Pachir Aw Agam District of Nangarhar, approximately   west of the Khyber Pass and   north of the border of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in Pakistan.  Tora Bora was known to be a stronghold location of the Taliban, used by  military forces against the Soviet Union during the 1980s.  Tora Bora and the surrounding Spīn Ghar range had natural caverns formed by streams eating into the limestone,    that had later been expanded into a CIA-financed complex built for the Mujahedeen. 

Taiga<====>31302<====>Taiga   Taiga ( ;  ; from Turkic ), also known as boreal forest or snow forest, is a biome characterized by coniferous forests consisting mostly of pines, spruces and larches. The taiga is the world's largest biome apart from the oceans.  In North America it covers most of inland Canada and Alaska as well as parts of the extreme northern continental United States (northern Minnesota through the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to Upstate New York and northern New England), where it is known as the Northwoods or "North woods".   In Eurasia, it covers most of Sweden, Finland, much of Norway, some of the Scottish Highlands, some lowland/coastal areas of Iceland, much of Russia from Karelia in the west to the Pacific Ocean (including much of Siberia), and areas of northern Kazakhstan, northern Mongolia, and northern Japan (on the island of Hokkaidō). 

Type II submarine<====>31304<====>Type II submarine  }   The Type II U-boat was designed by Nazi Germany as a coastal U-boat, modeled after the CV-707 submarine, which was designed by the Dutch dummy company NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw den Haag (I. v. S) (set up by Germany after World War I in order to maintain and develop German submarine technology and to circumvent the limitations set by the Treaty of Versailles) and built in 1933 by the Finnish Crichton-Vulcan shipyard in Turku, Finland.  It was too small to undertake sustained operations far away from the home support facilities.  Its primary role was found to be in the training schools, preparing new German naval officers for command. 

Tritium<====>31306<====>Tritium   Tritium (  or  ; symbol   or  , also known as hydrogen-3) is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen.  The nucleus of tritium (sometimes called a triton) contains one proton and two neutrons, whereas the nucleus of protium (by far the most abundant hydrogen isotope) contains one proton and no neutrons.  Naturally occurring tritium is extremely rare on Earth, where trace amounts are formed by the interaction of the atmosphere with cosmic rays.  It can be produced by irradiating lithium metal or lithium-bearing ceramic pebbles in a nuclear reactor.   Tritium is used as a radioactive tracer, in radioluminescent light sources for watches and instruments, and, along with deuterium, as a fuel for nuclear fusion reactions with applications in energy generation and weapons. 

Tau Ceti<====>31307<====>Tau Ceti Tau Ceti (τ Cet, τ Ceti) is a star in the constellation Cetus that is spectrally similar to the Sun, although it has only about 78% of the Sun's mass.  At a distance of just under   from the Solar System, it is a relatively nearby star, and is the closest solitary G-class star.  Alpha Centauri A is closer, but is a member of a triple system.   The star appears stable, with little stellar variation, and is metal-deficient. Observations have detected more than ten times as much dust surrounding Tau Ceti as is present in the Solar System. 

Tizoc<====>31316<====>Tizoc  Tizocic   or Tizocicatzin   usually known in English as Tizoc, was the seventh tlatoani of Tenochtitlan.

Type IX submarine<====>31331<====>Type IX submarine }   The Type IX U-boat was designed by Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine in 1935 and 1936 as a large ocean-going submarine for sustained operations far from the home support facilities.  Type IX boats were briefly used for patrols off the eastern United States in an attempt to disrupt the stream of troops and supplies bound for Europe.  It was derived from the Type IA, and appeared in various sub-types. Type IXs had six torpedo tubes; four at the bow and two at the stern.  They carried six reloads internally and had five external torpedo containers (three at the stern and two at the bow) which stored ten additional torpedoes. 

International Obfuscated C Code Contest<====>31332<====>International Obfuscated C Code Contest The International Obfuscated C Code Contest (abbreviated IOCCC) is a computer programming contest for the most creatively obfuscated C code.  Held annually in the years 1984–1996, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2004–2006, and then since 2011, it is described as "celebrating [C's] syntactical opaqueness".    The winning code for the 22nd contest, held in 2013, was released in January 2014.  Entries are evaluated anonymously by a panel of judges.  The judging process is documented in the competition guidelines  and consists of elimination rounds.  By tradition, no information is given about the total number of entries for each competition. 

Territorial integrity<====>31335<====>Territorial integrity Territorial integrity is the principle under international law that nation-states should not attempt to promote secessionist movements or to promote border changes in other nation-states.   Conversely it states that imposition by force of a border change is an act of aggression.  It is a political term, for example when applied to a nation-state like Iraq, which has borders which were imposed at the end of WWI.  In recent years there has been tension between this principle and the concept of humanitarian intervention under Article 73. b of the United Nations Charter "to develop self-government, to take due account of the political aspirations of the peoples, and to assist them in the progressive development of their free political institutions, according to the particular circumstances of each territory and its peoples and their varying stages of advancement.

Tachi<====>31337<====>Tachi  A   was a type of traditionally made Japanese sword (nihonto) worn by the samurai class of feudal Japan.  Tachi and katana generally differ in length, degree of curvature, and how they were worn when sheathed, the latter depending on the location of the mei or signature on the tang.  The tachi style of swords preceded the development of the katana, which was not mentioned by name until near the end of the twelfth century; tachi are known to have been made in the Kotō period, ranging from 900 to 1596. History and descriptionThe production of swords in Japan is divided into specific time periods:Jōkotō (ancient swords, until around 900)Kotō (old swords from around 900–1596)Shintō (new swords 1596–1780)Shinshintō (new new swords 1781–1876)Gendaitō (modern swords 1876–1945) Shinsakutō (newly made swords 1953–present) Authentic tachi were forged during the Kotō period, before 1596.

The Mythical Man-Month<====>31340<====>The Mythical Man-Month The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering is a book on software engineering and project management by Fred Brooks, whose central theme is that "adding manpower to a late software project makes it later".  This idea is known as Brooks's law, and is presented along with the second-system effect and advocacy of prototyping. Brooks' observations are based on his experiences at IBM while managing the development of OS/360.  He had added more programmers to a project falling behind schedule, a decision that he would later conclude had, counter-intuitively, delayed the project even further.  He also made the mistake of asserting that one project—writing an ALGOL compiler—would require six months, regardless of the number of workers involved (it required longer). 

Tupac Shakur<====>31341<====>Tupac Shakur Tupac Amaru Shakur (   )  (born Lesane Parish Crooks; June 16, 1971 September 13, 1996), also known by his stage names 2Pac and Makaveli, was an American rapper, poet and actor.

Shakur is consistently ranked as one of the greatest and most influential rappers of all time    and he has been listed and ranked as one of the greatest artists of any genre by many publications, including Rolling Stone, which ranked him 86th on its list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. 

The Picture of Dorian Gray<====>31342<====>The Picture of Dorian GrayThe Picture of Dorian Gray is a philosophical novel by Oscar Wilde, first published complete in the July 1890 issue of Lippincott's Monthly Magazine.  The Picture of Dorian Gray (Penguin Classics) – Introduction  Fearing the story was indecent, the magazine's editor without Wilde's knowledge deleted roughly five hundred words before publication.  Despite that censorship, The Picture of Dorian Gray offended the moral sensibilities of British book reviewers, some of whom said that Oscar Wilde merited prosecution for violating the laws guarding the public morality.  In response, Wilde aggressively defended his novel and art in correspondence with the British press, although he personally made excisions of some of the most controversial material when revising and lengthening the story for book publication the following year. 

Trilogy<====>31347<====>Trilogy A trilogy (from Greek τρι- tri-, "three" and -λογία -logia, "discourse") is a set of three works of art that are connected, and that can be seen either as a single work or as three individual works.  They are commonly found in literature, film, and video games, and are less common in other art forms.   Three-part works that are considered components of a larger work also exist, such as the triptych or the three-movement sonata, but they are not commonly referred to with the term "trilogy". Most trilogies are works of fiction involving the same characters or setting, such as The Deptford Trilogy of novels by Robertson Davies and The Apu Trilogy of films by Satyajit Ray.

Kemeny and Thomas E.  Kurtz. Background and FeaturesWhen True BASIC appeared on the market in 1985, the BASIC language was widely used on home computers, but with little standardization.  Each manufacturer implemented extensions to the language to support features of their hardware.  Initially based on Dartmouth BASIC 7 — otherwise known as ANSI BASIC — True BASIC implemented a number of new features over GW-BASIC, and allowed the user a redefinable 16-color, 640×480 pixel backdrop for program editing. 

Osmotic pressure<====>31383<====>Osmotic pressure Osmotic pressure is the minimum pressure which needs to be applied to a solution to prevent the inward flow of its pure solvent across a semipermeable membrane.It is also defined as the measure of the tendency of a solution to take in pure solvent (which belongs to the solution under discussion) by osmosis.  Potential osmotic pressure is the maximum osmotic pressure that could develop in a solution if it were separated from its pure solvent by a selectively permeable membrane.  The phenomenon of osmosis arises from the propensity of a pure solvent to move through a semipermeable membrane and into its solution containing a solute to which the membrane is impermeable. 

Twilight 2000<====>31384<====>Twilight 2000 Twilight 2000 is a role-playing game set in the aftermath of World War III (the "Twilight War").

Within the Donald Duck universe, the clan is related to the American Duck family through the marriage of Hortense McDuck and Quackmore Duck, Donald's parents.Clan McDuck was created by American comic book author Carl Barks, who also created the character of Scrooge McDuck. Barks' 1948 story "The Old Castle's Secret," in which Scrooge and his nephews search for hidden treasure in McDuck Castle, introduced the backstory of the clan. Other authors built on Barks' work, most notably Don Rosa in his 12-part comic saga The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck (1992–94) which introduced Scrooge's immediate family. Literary origins In the early 1950s, Carl Barks was in his second decade of creating comic book stories starring Donald Duck and his various relatives. He had personally created several of the latter, including cousin Gladstone Gander and uncle Scrooge McDuck, although the specific relationships between them were still uncertain. To better define these relationships, Barks created a version of the McDuck/Duck/Coot family tree for his own personal benefit, incidentally creating several additional characters.During his retirement, Barks' stories remained popular and gained him unexpected fame. Barks gave several interviews during which he answered questions about his stories and the characters he had created. In 1981, Barks described his personal version of Donald's family tree, which was used by amateur artist Mark Worden in drawing the family tree and including portraits of the characters mentioned. Worden's tree was first published in several fanzines, and later in the Disney-licensed Carl Barks Library, a ten-volume hardcover collection of Barks' stories in black-and-white.In 1987, Don Rosa, a long-time fan of Carl Barks and a personal friend of Mark Worden, started creating his own stories featuring Scrooge McDuck. His stories contained numerous references to older stories by Barks as well as several original ideas. After several years he gained a fan base of his own. In the early 1990s, the Egmont Group, the publishing house employing Rosa, offered him an ambitious assignment: he was to create the definitive version of Scrooge's biography and a family tree to accompany it. The project was intended to end decades of contradictions between stories which caused confusion to readers. The project was to become The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck. The family tree accompanying it was first published in Norway on July 3, 1993.In the process of working on Scrooge's biography, Rosa studied Barks' old stories in detail. Rosa made note of as many clues as he could of Scrooge's past given by Barks – which Rosa dubbed "Barksian facts" – and used them to write new stories. Despite the ambitious nature of the project, Rosa himself stressed in the introduction to the book "...this version of Scrooge's life is not the 'official' version – there's no particular reason why I (or anyone else) should expect other Duck writers to adhere to my vision of Scrooge's history. As carefully and authentically as I sought to construct it, it was never intended to be anything but my personal telling of the life of Scrooge McDuck." The seat of Clan McDuckThe seat of Clan McDuck is McDuck Castle (alternately called Castle McDuck) which is located in Dismal Downs, somewhere in Rannoch Moor, a non-fictional location within Scotland. The nearest village is the fictional MacDuich. The castle usually appears in good condition considering its great age. However, in the Barks story "Hound of the Whiskervilles" (1960) the castle is in ruins.The comics continuity does not establish when McDuck Castle was built, but it first appears (on the fictional timeline) in 946 when the Saxons laid siege to it. For many centuries the castle served as the home of the clan chief. In 1675, the McDucks were run out of the castle due to the depredations of a "monstrous devil dog" in Dismal Downs, later discovered to be a plot by the rival Clan Whiskerville.    At this time, many of the McDucks moved to the village of MacDuich and to Glasgow. Even after their departure, the clan still owned the castle and continued to pay the taxes by pooling their incomes. By 1885, only Fergus and Jake McDuck remain to pay the taxes, but their combined income is not enough, causing the Crown to auction it off. Scrooge then buys the estate, allowing his family to reoccupy the castle. He also hires local dogface Scottie McTerrier as caretaker.    Sometime after Scottie's death, Scrooge's sister Matilda becomes caretaker.   In the DuckTales continuity, Castle McDuck was built by Scrooge's great-great grandfather Silas who incorporated the castle into an existing Druid stone circle to save on construction costs. This story would date the castle itself to about the 18th century. The Druids, seeking revenge on the McDucks for taking away their sacred meeting place, scared the clan away using trained phosphorescent hounds. Years later, Scrooge returns with Huey, Dewey, Louie, and Webby and uncovers the mystery. Scrooge befriends the Druids and partners with them to turn Castle McDuck into a tourist attraction. Scrooge plans to give a share of the profit to the Druids as reparations for desecrating their stone circle. The story is loosely based on the Barks story "Hound of the Whiskervilles", which was in turn loosely based on The Hound of the Baskervilles. The castle appears in the Carl Barks stories The Old Castle's Secret (1948) and Hound of the Whiskervilles (1960) and in the Don Rosa stories The Last of the Clan McDuck (1992), The New Laird of Castle McDuck (1993), The Billionaire of Dismal Downs (1993) and The Old Castle's Other Secret or A Letter from Home (2004). Other comic book authors have also used the castle, such as Andrew Galton, Dave Angus, and Vicar in The Crying Monster (1982). In the TV series DuckTales, McDuck Castle appears in the episode "The Curse of Castle McDuck".Tartans of Clan MacDuckIn 1942, five years before the creation of Scrooge McDuck as a character, the Disney corporation created and registered a yellow, red, and green tartan pattern called "MacDuck Final Version" and used it to sell war bonds during World War II. The pattern currently has the Scottish Tartans Authority reference number 1121 and is included in the official Scottish Register of Tartans. In 1984, Disney also created a brown, green, and black tartan which was registered as "MacDuck" with the Scottish Tartans World Register of the now-defunct Scottish Tartans Society (reference number 1080). This pattern is not officially recognized in Scotland. Nevertheless, both the 1121 and 1080 patterns are non-fictional in nature and available as bolts of cloth or finished kilts and other garments from the House of Tartan. The fictional McDuck tartan first appears in 1960 in Hound of the Whiskervilles. However, the coloring of the tartan was not Barks' decision but that of colorists working for Dell Comics, which first published the story; subsequent publications showed the tartan having differing colors. When Don Rosa decided to include the tartan in his stories, he used the original coloring of green and orange. Nevertheless, some European publications have still shown variations in Rosa's color scheme.  (See Sir Roast McDuck's tam o' shanter cap in the illustration at the top of the page, which was first published in France.)  The old clansmen seen on DuckTales wear a green and orange tartan, but of a slightly different design from that of the comics.  Ancient McDucksScrooge Shah and Prince DondukScrooge Shah was the last king of Sagbad and the earliest known ancestor of Scrooge McDuck. A young King Khan Khan (2050 BC-1967 AD) sacked the city of Sagbad in 2033 BC, but Scrooge Shah and Prince Donduk, his heir apparent, managed to escape. Khan Khan lost their tracks, but would much later locate their distant descendants. Scrooge Shah features in the story "King Scrooge the First" (1967) by Carl Barks and Tony Strobl.Pah-Peh-RheoPah-Peh-Rheo lived in the 1st century BC and was the founding father of Clan McDuck. He was born in Egypt and became a Roman citizen, taking the name Petronius Paperonius. Originally following a campaign of the Roman army to Britain, he eventually decided to settle in Caledonia (the Roman name for Scotland) among the ancient Picts. He was also a non-royal uncle of Cleopatra.  Pah-Peh-Rheo appears in the eight-part "Storia e gloria della dinastia dei paperi" (1970;  ) by Romano Scarpa, Giorgio Cavazzano, and Giovan Battista Carpi.Postclassical McDucksEider McDuckSir Eider McDuck (880-946; from earlier Eider MacDuich) was the chief of Clan McDuck during an Anglo-Saxon invasion in 946 (despite England and Scotland signing a peace treaty in 945). Eider was killed during the Anglo-Saxons' siege of McDuck Castle after his serfs abandoned him. He had refused to buy them arrows because they were too expensive, and only paid his serfs, collectively, 30 copper pieces an hour. Don Rosa: Birth And Death Dates Of The Ducks, Coots And McDucks  Carl Barks: The Old Castle's Secret. First published in 1948 (I.N.D.U.C.K.S. entry).  Eider McDuck is first mentioned in Barks' The Old Castle's Secret (1948).Friar Juicy McDuck (910-971) and Sir Smokt McDuck (b. 921) are buried in the McDuck cemetery as seen in the Carl Barks painting Dubious Doings at Dismal Downs.Quackly McDuckSir Quackly McDuck (1010-1057; from earlier Quackly MacDuich) was clan chief when King Macbeth was killed in 1057. That same year, Macbeth offered Quackly a treasure chest in exchange for his support in the ongoing war for the throne. Quackly agreed and served the king during the war, but became obsessed with protecting the treasure, eventually trapping himself inside the castle walls with it. Quackly and his treasure became a McDuck legend, and it is believed that his ghost continues to protect the treasure and the castle. In 1877, Quackly's ghost saves a young Scrooge McDuck from the Whiskervilles of Dismal Downs. Without revealing his true identity, he suggests to Scrooge that he travel to America and work for his Uncle Pothole, thus serving as the catalyst for all of Scrooge's adventures. In 1885, Quackly again tries to save Scrooge, but his action unintentionally brings about Scrooge's temporary death. In heaven, Quackly is reprimanded by his relatives for interfering in earthly events.   Quackly McDuck is first mentioned in The Old Castle's Secret (1948) by Carl Barks, and first appears in The Last of the Clan McDuck (1994) by Don Rosa.Stuft McDuckSir Stuft McDuck (1110-1175) was a successful chief of Clan McDuck who oversaw a period of prosperity. Roast McDuckSir Roast McDuck (1159-1205) succeeded his father, Stuft McDuck, as clan chief, at which point Clan McDuck was one of the richest clans in Scotland. However, in 1189, Roast offered much of the clan's wealth to the king of Scotland, William the Lion, after William asked for his help in paying tribute to Richard I of England. This act of patriotic generosity led to financial ruin for the clan. Aside from this imprudence, Roast is primarily remembered for his gluttony. In 1205 he raided the king's pantry and ate himself to death. Roast's memorial suit of armor displayed in Castle McDuck holds a knife and fork in its hands.  Don Rosa: "The Last of the Clan McDuck" (part 1 of The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck). First published 1992 (I.N.D.U.C.K.S. entry).  The character is first mentioned in The Old Castle's Secret (1948) by Carl Barks. He has a small speaking role in The Last of the Clan McDuck (1994) but makes his first appearance in The New Laird of Castle McDuck.Swamphole McDuckSir Swamphole McDuck (1190-1260)  succeeded his father Roast McDuck as clan chief and inherited its financial problems. In 1220, Swamphole sealed the dungeon of Castle McDuck, stated as an attempt to decrease maintenance costs. He did, however, create secret passageways in the castle leading to the dungeons. (These passageways would later be useful during subsequent sieges.) After his death in 1260, Swamphole was not buried in the clan cemetery, rather, his skeleton was placed inside his memorial suit of armor which was placed in Castle McDuck. Swamphole McDuck is first mentioned in The Old Castle's Secret by Carl Barks.  In The Old Castle's Other Secret or A Letter from Home (2004) by Don Rosa, it is revealed that Swamphole sealed the dungeons not to reduce maintenance costs, but to conceal a treasure.Donald McDuckSir Donald McDuck, nicknamed "Black Donald" because of his foul temper, is said to have invented golf, hammer throw, and caber toss in 1440. His temper while playing golf resulted in James II of Scotland outlawing the sport. Black Donald is mentioned in "The History of the Clan McDuck" by Don Rosa.Simon McDuckSir Simon McDuck (1437-1509) was the treasurer of the Knights Templar and hid their treasure beneath McDuck Castle. He is mentioned in The Old Castle's Other Secret or A Letter from Home (2004) by Don Rosa.Modern McDucksEarly modern McDucksMalcolm McDuckMalcolm "Matey" McDuck (1530-1564?) was a McDuck relative who settled in England and is suggested to be a previous incarnation of Scrooge McDuck. Malcolm served in the English Navy, and in 1563 he became first mate of the frigate HMS Falcon Rover, serving under Captain Loyal Hawk. The Falcon Rover raided Spanish targets in the Caribbean Sea between 1563 and 1564. Also serving on the Falcon Rover was the boatswain, Pintail Duck, an ancestor of Donald Duck.Malcolm is said to have lost his life on 9 December 1564 when the Spanish fleet sunk the HMS Falcon Rover. However, in 1579, Malcolm was also said to have commanded the newly founded Ford Drakeborough, an establishment that in 1818 was taken over by Cornelius Coot and renamed Fort Duckburg. Carl Barks: "Back to Long Ago!". First published 1956 (I.N.D.U.C.K.S. entry)  Malcolm first appears in "Back to Long Ago!" (1956) by Carl Barks.Locksley McDuckLocksley McDuck was an 18th-century McDuck relative. Sometime after 1707, he became an associate of Scottish outlaw Rob Roy MacGregor who is characterized as a noble thief who would "rob from the rich to give to the poor". Lockely's alliance with MacGregor would come to an end after Locksley was unable to "give to the poor" after having robbed the rich. He is mentioned in The History of The Clan McDuck by Don Rosa. His name is derived from "Robin of Loxley", a traditional name for Robin Hood.Hugh McDuckCaptain Hugh "Seafoam" McDuck (1710-1776) was a McDuck relative who settled in Glasgow in 1727, as the clan had been driven from their ancestral home of Dismal Downs in 1675. Hugh turned to the sea for a living and became a successful merchant. He obtained his own ship, the Golden Goose, and became known by the nickname "Seafoam".In 1753, Seafoam McDuck signed a contract with Swindle McSue to deliver a cargo of horseradish to Jamaica. But McSue sabotaged the Golden Goose and the ship sank before reaching Jamaica. Upon returning to Scotland, Seafoam McDuck learned that his contract with McSue contained fine print stating that if the shipment was not completed, McDuck would forfeit all his possessions to McSue. Seafoam escaped with nothing but the clothes on his back, a silver pocket watch, and the golden dentures in his mouth. Carl Barks: Untitled Uncle Scrooge story, later known as "The Horseradish Story". First published 1953 (I.N.D.U.C.K.S. entry).  It is later presumed that Seafoam was involved in the American Revolutionary War and died in 1776. His descendant Quagmire McDuck inherited the silver pocket watch. Seafoam McDuck first appears in The Horseradish Story (1953) by Carl Barks.Silas McDuckAccording to the DuckTales episode "The Curse of Castle McDuck", Silas McDuck was Scrooge's great-great grandfather who built McDuck Castle. In order to save on construction costs, Silas had built the castle on an ancient Druid stone circle, incurring the wrath of the Druids. Silas' portrait is seen hanging in the castle when Scrooge visits.Modern family tree by Carl BarksThe family tree below shows the McDuck portion of Donald's family tree according to Carl Barks. The chart is based on a 1950s sketch made by Barks for personal use, which was latter illustrated by artist Mark Worden in 1981. According to Barks, Matilda McDuck is married to Goosetail Gander, and the couple adopts Donald's cousin Gladstone. The character Old "Scotty" McDuck does not appear in any stories, but eventually became Fergus McDuck in Don Rosa's stories. Modern family tree by Don RosaThis family tree is based on the work of Don Rosa.Modern McDucks (1st generation)Dingus McDuck"Dirty" Dingus McDuck, was Scrooge's grandfather. He worked as a coal miner,  married Molly Mallard, and had three sons – Angus, Fergus, and Jake. He appeared in Don Rosa's illustrated family tree, but has not appeared in any stories; his name does appear in the 2017 incarnation of DuckTales.A 1960s story by Bob Gregory and Tony Strobl identifies Scrooge's grandfather as Titus McDuck who was also a coal miner.  It is unclear if Titus is an alternate spelling or another grandfather.Molly MallardMolly Mallard was the wife of Dingus McDuck and the mother of Angus, Fergus, and Jake McDuck. Her first and only appearance was in an illustrated family tree created by Don Rosa; she has not appeared in any stories. Coincidentally, her maiden name is the same as the last name of the main character in Darkwing Duck.Quagmire McDuckQuagmire McDuck was Dingus McDuck's brother and Scrooge McDuck's great uncle. He inherited a silver watch from his ancestor Hugh "Seafoam" McDuck and passed it on to his nephew Fergus. After his death, Quagmire's estate remained unclaimed. Quagmire appears in the Carl Barks story "The Heirloom Watch" (1955). Modern McDucks (2nd generation)Angus "Pothole" McDuckAngus "Pothole" McDuck (born 1829) is the first child of Dingus and Molly McDuck, and is Scrooge's uncle. Angus was born in Glasgow in 1829.  He was first mentioned in "The Great Steamboat Race" by Carl Barks and later appeared in person in a handful of stories by Don Rosa.Angus migrated to the United States during the late 1840s. In 1850 he was working as a cabin boy in the Mississippi riverboat Drennan Whyte when it sunk. He was the only survivor. Don Rosa: "The Master of the Mississippi" (chapter 2 of The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck. First published 1992 (I.N.D.U.C.K.S. entry).  He continued working on Mississippi riverboats and he had obtained his own by 1861, named Cotton Queen. Around the time of the American Civil War (1861–1865) he became quite successful as a river boater. Soon after the end of the war in 1865 he and fellow river boater Porker Hogg became the co-owners of Cornpone Gables, a Southern plantation that had gone bankrupt. The two were unable to settle their differences and they decided to have a riverboat race in 1870 to decide who would be the owner. Both riverboats sank. Porker had two more riverboats but Angus spent the next ten years as a professional card player.In 1880, in a poker game with Porker, Angus won the rights to one of his rival's riverboats, named Dilly Dollar. Porker soon lost his other riverboat to Blackheart Beagle and his sons, the first generation of the Beagle Boys, a family of outlaws, and retired. Angus on the other hand hired his nephew Scrooge McDuck and a penniless inventor named Ratchet Gearloose as his crew. Business wasn't going well and Angus decided to retire in 1882. He left his riverboat to his nephew and settled down in New Orleans. He became the writer of a series of dime novels under the title The Master of Mississippi, based on a highly exaggerated description of his life. His dime novels became very popular and to have more material to add he occasionally traveled through the country. Don Rosa: "The Vigilante of Pizen Bluff". First published 1996 (I.N.D.U.C.K.S. entry)  In the story "The Vigilante of Pizen Bluff" by Don Rosa, he is seen appearing at Buffalo Bill's Wild West. After the show's money is stolen by the Dalton Gang, Angus rides out with Bill, Scrooge, P. T. Barnum, Annie Oakley, and Geronimo to stop the bandits. Angus' exact date of death is unknown.In 1955, Porker's nephew, Horseshoe Hogg, and Scrooge McDuck would bring their uncles' steamboats back to the surface to finish the race for Cornpone Gables. Scrooge won, only to learn that 85 years of disuse made the mansion so fragile that he accidentally destroyed it with a sneeze.Fergus McDuckFergus McDuck (1830-1902 Don Rosa: "The Billionaire of Dismal Downs" (part 9 of The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck). First published 1993 (I.N.D.U.C.K.S. entry). ) is the second child of Dingus and Molly McDuck and the father of Scrooge McDuck. As such he is a prominent character in The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck.He was born in Glasgow in 1830 to Dingus McDuck and Molly Mallard, who were both working as coal miners at the time. He spent most of his life as a mill worker. According to a story by William Van Horn, Fergus at some point had a short marriage with an unidentified woman, with whom he had the son Rumpus McFowl.  He later married Downy O'Drake, his wife in Rosa's stories, who became the mother of four of his children – Scrooge, Scrooge's Twin Brother "Mani Buche" De' Paperoni, Matilda, and Hortense. An Italian character, Gideon McDuck, might also be a son of Fergus.The rest of Fergus' biography is shown in The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck. In 1877 he encouraged his son to work to have his own money. Scrooge's obvious intelligence, skill at hard work and ambition made his father believe that Scrooge would be able to restore Clan McDuck to its former glory. In 1885 the Clan's hereditary lands would have been seized due to Fergus' inability to pay his taxes. But Scrooge spent his savings at the time ($10,000) to pay the taxes and become the new owner of their lands. Don Rosa: "The New Laird of Castle McDuck" (part 5 of The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck). First published 1993 (I.N.D.U.C.K.S. entry).  While Scrooge was away, Fergus and his family moved back to Castle McDuck, abandoned for centuries in Dismal Downs. The family continued to work to pay for the taxes and Scrooge sent them most all of the money he earned while traveling. Fergus became a widower in 1897.Scrooge became rich in the Klondike and returned to Scotland in 1902 as a billionaire. Scrooge's intention was originally to settle in Dismal Downs but he quickly changed his mind and decided to settle in the United States. He wanted to take his family with him. His sisters accepted but Fergus decided to stay. He died during the night, aged 72, and was re-united with his wife Downy and the rest of the McDuck-clan as his three children left Scotland. In the NES game DuckTales 2, Scrooge and his nephews found a piece of a treasure map that apparently belonged to Fergus. It claimed to lead to Fergus' lost treasure. However, due to Fergus' inability to pay taxes, it is presumed that this map is not canonical to The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck, unless such treasure was obtained later in his life.In Don Rosa's The Old Castle's Other Secret or A Letter from Home, it's revealed that Fergus tried to find the Knights Templar treasure hidden in the castle McDuck by one of his ancestors, a Knight himself. Even though Fergus decided not to tell Scrooge about the treasure, he learns about it through other ways and, like Matilda McDuck, thinks Fergus kept the secret from him because he disapproved Scrooge. In the middle of their way to the treasure, Scrooge, Matilda and Scrooge's nephews find a letter from Fergus, who believed Scrooge would eventually find it, revealing the reason he hid the secret from Scrooge is that Scrooge would feel better building his own fortune instead of inheriting one. Fergus' name and image are also present in the 2017 DuckTales series, which draws heavily from the comics.Downy O'DrakeDowny McDuck (née O'Drake; 1840-1897) is Scrooge McDuck's mother. She was created by Don Rosa and first appears in The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck. She is of Irish origin and was born in 1840.  She married Fergus McDuck and became the mother of five children: Scrooge, De' Paperoni, Matilda, and Hortense. Downy has 2 sisters one named Vera and a brother named Angus.She was a very devoted housewife and mother. She settled in Castle McDuck at Dismal Downs, Clan McDuck's old castle, along with her family in 1885. She died in 1897,  and was buried in the McDucks' cemetery.  She later appeared to her husband Fergus at his own passing, and together they joined various McDuck ancestors.Downy's image and name are also present in the 2017 incarnation of DuckTales, usually alongside those of her husband.Jake McDuckJake McDuck (1832-?) is Scrooge McDuck's uncle. He was mentioned in the story "A Christmas for Shacktown" (1952) by Carl Barks, in which Donald Duck dresses up as Jake in an attempt to trick Scrooge into giving money to charity.The character was later used by Don Rosa, and appears in three of twelve original chapters of Rosa's The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck. He lived in the same house as his brother Fergus McDuck and helped Fergus and his wife Downy O'Drake to raise their children.  He settled in McDuck castle along with his brother in 1885.  However, it appears that by 1902, Jake was no longer living there.According to Rosa's sketches and timelines, Jake was born in 1832  to coal miners Dingus McDuck and Molly Mallard, and grew up to become a stockyard hand in Glasgow. His date of death is unknown, but it appears that both Scrooge and Donald believed him to be alive in 1952.Modern McDucks (3rd generation)Rumpus McFowlRumpus McFowl was created by William Van Horn and introduced as a lazy and greedy cousin of Scrooge McDuck. It was soon revealed that he was Scrooge's half-brother. His exact relationship with the other characters is unknown. It has been stated, however, that his mother was briefly married to Fergus McDuck Before he married Downy.(In Gilles Maurice's tree she is stated to be Downy's sister) and then adopted by his mother and Mr. McFowl.Scrooge McDuck Scrooge McDuck (1867, according to Don Rosa) is the first child of Fergus and Downy McDuck and is the protagonist of most stories involving the Clan McDuck. He does not marry and has no offspring of his own, although he does come to maintain close relationships with his nephew Donald Duck and his grandnephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck."Mani buche" De' Paperoni"Mani buche" De' Paperoni (note "De' Paperoni" is the clan name in Italian) is presented as Scrooge's twin brother in the Italian story "Paperino e l'Uomo del West" (Donald Duck and the Man from the West), written by Guido Martina and drawn by Giovan Battista Carpi."Mani buche" is a philanthropist and lives in Arizona. In Italian, his name literally means "hands with holes", an idiom used in Italy to portray someone who spends a lot of money (i.e. his hands can't hold the money so it drains away like water).Gideon McDuckGideon McDuck (Gedeone de' Paperoni in original Italian) is presented as Scrooge McDuck's younger brother, and mainly appears in Italian comic stories; in those stories, Gideon is the editor of the newspaper "The Cricket", Romano Scarpa: "Paperino e i gamberi in salmì". First published 1956 (I.N.D.U.C.K.S. entry)  the most credible newspaper in Duckburg. Gideon also has an antagonistic relationship with his brother Scrooge.The character was created by Romano Scarpa, and first appeared in a story published on February 10, 1956. Gideon's existence is inconsistent with Carl Barks's view of Scrooge as presented in "The Old Castle's Secret".  In this story, Scrooge states that he is the last of the Clan McDuck. Though Don Rosa hasn't used Gideon in his family tree or his timelines, fans have speculated that he could be an illegitimate son of Fergus McDuck born somewhere between the death of Fergus' wife in 1897 and Fergus' own death in 1902. That would mean Scrooge is the last legitimate McDuck and that Gideon is the last of Fergus' six children and a younger half-brother of Rumpus McFowl, Scrooge McDuck, De' Paperoni McDuck, Matilda McDuck and Hortense McDuck.Matilda McDuckMatilda McDuck (born 1871) is one of Scrooge McDuck's two sisters. She was first mentioned in Carl Barks' 1950s sketch for a Duck family tree, where she was shown to have adopted Gladstone Gander. Carl Barks' Duck Family Trees  The Matilda McDuck character was dropped in Barks' 1991 Duck Family Tree sketch (where Gladstone Gander is the biological grandson of Grandma Duck and not related to Scrooge), but Don Rosa picked up the name, and used Matilda McDuck as a prominent character in The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck.Matilda McDuck was born in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1871 to Fergus McDuck and Downy O'Drake.  She is the younger sister of Scrooge McDuck. She has a younger sister named Hortense.In contrast to Scrooge and Hortense's fiery tempers, she usually had a calm demeanor. In 1902 Scrooge returned to Scotland and took both of his sisters with him to go to America.  When he established his base in Duckburg, Calisota, United States he left Matilda and Hortense to run his empire from 1902 to 1930. In the meantime he traveled the world expanding his financial empire. In 1930, a conflict with Scrooge ended all relationships between him and his family, and his sisters are believed to have left Duckburg. Don Rosa: "The Richest Duck in the World" (chapter 11 of The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck). First published 1994 (I.N.D.U.C.K.S. entry) In the story The Old Castle's Other Secret or A Letter from Home (2004), Don Rosa used Matilda McDuck in a non-Life and Times story for the first time. In this story, it is shown that she was hired by her nephew Donald Duck (son of Hortense) to tend the McDuck castle in Scotland. The story shows the reconciliation between Matilda and Scrooge. It is suggested that Donald deliberately set them up for a reunion. Unfortunately, he did not get the thanks he expected. This is the first time Huey, Dewey, and Louie met their great aunt. In that story, Scrooge returns to McDuck Castle for another treasure and learns from Matilda that his family already knew about the treasure but their father Fergus decided not to tell Scrooge about it. Both Scrooge and Matilda thought that was because of Fergus' disapproval of Scrooge's greedy ways but after finding a letter on the way for the treasure (hence the other title "A Letter from Home") they learn Fergus's real motive was that he thought Scrooge would feel better building his own fortune instead of simply inheriting one.Matilda, while trying to leave the castle, mentions Hortense. However, in the commentary in the American printing of the story, Don Rosa states that he was prevented from using Hortense because he would have had to explain why she had abandoned her family. So Hortense's fate remains a mystery. In the notes to the Danish publication of the story (Hall of Fame - Don Rosa Book 10), it is stated that the publisher decided that Hortense was "officially dead".Matilda is usually drawn with a flower on her hat, which loses a petal in each panel in which she appears.Don Rosa has suggested that Matilda McDuck could have married the well-known Disney character Ludwig Von Drake. Hortense McDuckHortense Duck (née McDuck; b. 1876) was introduced as a relatively well-connected member of her family. A daughter-in-law to Grandma Duck, a sister to Matilda McDuck and Scrooge McDuck, wife to Quackmore Duck, sister-in-law of Goosetave Gander and Daphne Duck, aunt to Gladstone Gander, mother to Della Duck and Donald Duck, and finally grandmother to Huey, Dewey, and Louie.Hortense was born in 1876 in Glasgow, Scotland as the youngest child of Fergus McDuck and Downy O'Drake. In Barks' tree, her older brother was Scrooge McDuck and her older sister Matilda McDuck. Some non-Barks writers gave Scrooge two half-brothers, Rumpus McFowl and Gideon McDuck, though these do not appear in Barks' conception of the family. De' Paperoni is a twin of Scrooge in a story. Jake McDuck, her paternal uncle, was also living with them.Hortense was born in a working class family living in relative poverty. In 1877 her ten-year-old brother Scrooge started working as a shoe polisher in an effort to help support his family. At the time Hortense was merely an infant sucking on her thumb. She observed from a distance with her father and sister while her brother earned the number one dime. Scrooge would spend some of his leisure time with his younger sisters, and occasionally repaired their dolls. Otherwise Hortense spent most of her time clinging to her older sister.By 1880, Scrooge came to realise that his earnings were not enough despite his hard work and efforts. He emigrated to the United States in hopes of earning his own fortune. He was hired as a cabin boy on a merchant ship heading to New Orleans. Scrooge noted that Hortense's "Bye, Scroogey" were her first spoken words. Before that, all she could say was "glxblt".From an early age it was obvious Hortense had a fairly nasty temper combined with considerable strength, and on at least one occasion (in The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck, Chapter 10) she has been called a spitfire. In 1882, Scrooge was hired as a cowboy by Murdo MacKenzie. To do this he had to ride Widow Maker, a mare who had already managed to dispose of five other cowboys. Scrooge soon managed to become her rider although he never really managed to tame her. He renamed the horse Hortense after his spirited six-year-old sister. The latter found this idea unflattering at best.In 1885, the Clan McDuck's hereditary lands were in danger of being seized due to her father being unable to pay taxes. The lands also included Dismal Downs, the Clan's castle which had been abandoned since 1675. The Whiskervilles, traditional enemies of the McDucks since the 15th century, planned to gain ownership of the lands and were already trying to plunder the castle and its graveyard in search of old relics and treasure. Fergus and Jake guarded the Castle in order to stop them. Nine-year-old Hortense offered to help them and proved more effective in conflict than either of the elder McDucks. The Whiskervilles came to fear her.In 1902 Scrooge McDuck returned to Scotland to fetch Hortense and their sister Matilda McDuck. When Scrooge established Duckburg, Calisota as his home base he started journeying the world trying to expand his financial empire. One of her proudest moments was when she single handedly caused the entire US military to flee Killmotor Hill armed only with a broom and her bad temper, much to the shame of the current president, Theodore Roosevelt, and the fear of the soldiers. From 1902 till 1930, she and Matilda ran Scrooge's empire from his home base while he was away. During these years Hortense met her boyfriend, Quackmore Duck, whom she married in 1920. Later the same year she gave birth to twins. Her son was named Donald Duck and her daughter Della Duck. Of the two only the boy inherited his mother's temper. A fight with Scrooge in 1930 ended all relationships between Scrooge and his family and she retired.Scrooge may have claimed that he is the last McDuck, as he is the only male left. Hortense and Matilda changed their names to Duck after marriage, so, technically, Scrooge is the last McDuck.Hortense is mentioned and pictured in the DuckTales 2017 premier "Woo-oo!", where Webby Vanderquack cites her as a connecting link between the triplets and Scrooge.Douglas McDuckDouglas McDuck is a cousin of Scrooge who has appeared in several Danish Disney comic stories. He looks like Scrooge not only in appearance but also in temperament. He is, however, hopeless at finding and identifying gold and often frustrates Scrooge by criticizing him for not being "McDuck-like" enough. In the story "Smarter Than The Toughies", Douglas was portrayed as being the uncle of Whitewater Duck.Lurch McDuckLurch McDuck, also known as Sheik Beak, is Scrooge's cousin in the 1968 story "The Doony Desert Dilemma" by Vic Lockman and Tony Strobl. An imposter calling himself Lurch McDuck and claiming to be Scrooge's long-lost cousin attempts to defraud Scrooge of half his fortune. Moocher McDuckMoocher McDuck is the beggar cousin of Scrooge who appeared for the first time in the story "Too Many McDucks" by Tony Strobl. Moocher's look is very similar to Scrooge's, except for the fact that he wears tattered clothes, but unlike his very rich cousin, Moocher is a sweetheart. He was used in some Brazilian comic stories in the 1970s.Other relativesDuck family The Duck family are Scrooge's American relatives and include his nephew Donald and grandnephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie. They are related through Hortense's marriage to Quackmore Duck, Donald's father.Aunt EiderAunt Eider is the aunt of both Scrooge McDuck and John D. Rockerduck. The Italian story "La Stella di Burbank",  where she is portrayed as a myopic old woman who doesn't realize she needs to wear glasses, is presumably her first comic book appearance. But Aunt Eider appears wearing glasses in her next three comic book appearances. Dick Kinney wrote the last three comic stories where this character was used, and three famous cartoonists respectively drew those ones. Al Hubbard, Marco Rota and Giorgio Cavazzano. Neither of these stories was published in America. The story "Most Helpful Aunt Eider" is the only one where Aunt Eider doesn't meet her wealthy nephews. It's a Junior Woodchucks story. Since there isn't any clue on how the tireless and slightly bossy Aunt Eider could be the aunt of both Scrooge and Rockerduck in the comic stories with her, some fans of this universe have invented their own explanations for this fact. It really seems she never had a surname, so she has been connected to Scrooge's family through his paternal grandmother, Molly Mallard, who would be an aunt of Eider. This wouldmake Eider a Mallard too, but, of course, this is not a widely accepted explanation at all. According to this same invented explanation, Aunt Eider would be a sister of Rockerduck's mother.The first version of Scrooge's grandmother, Nonna Jenny, looks like Aunt Eider.  She was created by the Italian comic artists Guido Martina and Giovan Battista Carpi especially for the handbook I pensieri di Paperone, first published in 1973. Ludwig Von Drake Ludwig Von Drake is Donald Duck's uncle whose relationship has never been consistently described. Don Rosa fans have speculated that Ludwig is married to Matilda McDuck, but the Disney company has portrayed him as a bachelor.In other languages , "The Duck Clan" , "Family Makdak" , "The line of the Mac Ducks" , "Family Aethalönd". The term Ættin refers to an extended family, dynasty, or clan.    In the Dutch and Finnish languages, Scrooge personally drops the "Mac/Mc" from his last name while other members of his family retain it.See alsoDonald Duck universe:Duck family (Disney)List of Donald Duck universe charactersThe Life and Times of Scrooge McDuckReal-life:Rannoch MoorList of Scottish clansList of family seats of Scottish nobilityNotes External linksVarious Duck family trees with commentary.

Topaz<====>31415<====>Topaz   Topaz is a silicate mineral of aluminium and fluorine with the chemical formula Al 2 SiO 4 (F, OH) 2 .  Topaz crystallizes in the orthorhombic system, and its crystals are mostly prismatic terminated by pyramidal and other faces.   It is one of the hardest naturally occurring minerals (Mohs hardness of 8) and is the hardest of any silicate (i. e. , silicon-based) mineral.   This hardness combined with its usual transparency and variety of colors means that it has acquired wide use in jewellery as a cut gemstone as well as for intaglios and other gemstone carvings. 

Ted Raimi<====>31416<====>Ted Raimi  Theodore "Ted" Raimi (born December 14, 1965)  is an American actor, director, comedian, and writer perhaps best known for his role as Joxer the Mighty in Xena: Warrior Princess/Hercules: The Legendary Journeys.  Raimi plays Ted Hoffman in his brother Sam's Spider-Man trilogy.  Early lifeRaimi was born to a Jewish family  in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Celia  (née Abrams), a lingerie store proprietor, and Leonard Raimi, a furniture store proprietor.  Ted was raised in Conservative Judaism; his ancestors immigrated from Russia and Hungary.   He attended Wylie E.  Groves High School in Birmingham, Michigan where he was a popular DJ on WGHS, a blues harp prodigy, and an active member of the Groves Cinema Society. 

The Monkees<====>31417<====>The Monkees   The Monkees are an American rock and pop band originally active between 1965 and 1971, with subsequent reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed.  They were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider for the American television series The Monkees, which aired from 1966 to 1968.  The musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork and British stage and television actor and singer Davy Jones.  The band's music was initially supervised by producer Don Kirshner, backed by the songwriting duo of Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart. 

Thermobaric weapon<====>31418<====>Thermobaric weaponA thermobaric weapon is a type of explosive that uses oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion, and in practice the blast wave typically produced by such a weapon is of a significantly longer duration than that produced by a conventional condensed explosive.  The fuel-air bomb is one of the best-known types of thermobaric weapons. Most conventional explosives consist of a fuel-oxidizer premix (gunpowder, for example, contains 25% fuel and 75% oxidizer), whereas thermobaric weapons are almost 100% fuel, so thermobaric weapons are significantly more energetic than conventional condensed explosives of equal weight.  Their reliance on atmospheric oxygen makes them unsuitable for use underwater, at high altitude, and in adverse weather. 

Tabasco sauce<====>31419<====>Tabasco sauce  Tabasco sauce is a brand of hot sauce made exclusively from tabasco peppers (Capsicum frutescens var.  tabasco), vinegar, and salt.  It is produced by McIlhenny Company of Avery Island, Louisiana. HistoryAlthough the name comes from the Mexican state of Tabasco, the sauce is an American product produced by McIlhenny Company.  Tabasco sauce was first produced in 1868 by Edmund McIlhenny, a Maryland-born former banker who moved to Louisiana around 1840.  McIlhenny initially used discarded cologne bottles to distribute his sauce to family and friends.   In 1868 when he started to sell to the public he ordered thousands of new cologne bottles from a New Orleans glass supplier. 

Talc<====>31422<====>Talc    Talc or talcum is a clay mineral composed of hydrated magnesium silicate with the chemical formula H 2 Mg 3 (SiO 3 ) 4  or Mg 3 Si 4 O 10 (OH) 2 .  In loose form, it was one of the most widely used substances known as baby powder, along with corn starch.  It occurs as foliated to fibrous masses, and in an exceptionally rare crystal form.  It has a perfect basal cleavage, and the folia are not elastic, although slightly flexible. Mohs scale of mineral hardness, based on scratch hardness comparison, defines value 1 as the hardness of talc. 

Tom Collins<====>31423<====>Tom Collins   The Tom Collins is a Collins cocktail made from gin, lemon juice, sugar, and carbonated water.  First memorialized in writing in 1876 by Jerry Thomas, "the father of American mixology", this "gin and sparkling lemonade" drink is typically served in a Collins glass over ice.  A "Collins mix" can be bought premixed in the supermarket and enjoyed alone (like a soft drink) or with gin. HistoryIn August 1891, British physician Sir Morell Mackenzie wrote an article in the 19th century influential magazine Fortnightly Review claiming that England was the originating country for the Tom Collins cocktail and a person named John Collins was its creator. 

Torpedo<====>31424<====>Torpedo The modern torpedo is a self-propelled weapon with an explosive warhead, launched above or below the water surface, propelled underwater towards a target, and designed to detonate either on contact with its target or in proximity to it. Historically, it was called an automotive, automobile, locomotive or fish torpedo; colloquially called a fish.  The term torpedo was originally employed for a variety of devices, most of which would today be called mines.  From about 1900, torpedo has been used strictly to designate an underwater self-propelled weapon. While the battleship had evolved primarily around engagements between armoured ships with large-caliber guns, the torpedo allowed torpedo boats and other lighter surface ships, submersibles, even ordinary fishing boats or frogmen, and later, aircraft, to destroy large armoured ships without the need of large guns, though sometimes at the risk of being hit by longer-range shellfire. 

Turkish cuisine<====>31427<====>Turkish cuisine Turkish cuisine (Turkish: Türk mutfağı) is largely the heritage of Ottoman cuisine, which can be described as a fusion and refinement of Central Asian, Middle Eastern and Balkan cuisines.Turkish cuisine has in turn influenced those and other neighbouring cuisines, including those of Southeast Europe (Balkans), Central Europe, and Western Europe.The Ottomans fused various culinary traditions of their realm with influences from Levantine cuisines, along with traditional Turkic elements from Central Asia (such as yogurt and mantı), creating a vast array of specialities—many with strong regional associations.  Turkish cuisine varies across the country. 

Tourmaline<====>31428<====>Tourmaline Tourmaline (   ) is a crystalline boron silicate mineral compounded with elements such as aluminium, iron, magnesium, sodium, lithium, or potassium.  Tourmaline is classified as a semi-precious stone and the gemstone comes in a wide variety of colors.  According to the Madras Tamil Lexion   the name comes from the Sinhalese word  "Thoramalli" (තෝරමල්ලි) or "tōra- molli", which is applied to a group of gemstones found in Sri Lanka.  According to the Madras Tamil Lexicon, the Tamil "tuvara-malli" (துவரைமல்லி) and Toramalli are also derived from the Sinhalese root word.  This etymology is also given in other standard dictionaries including the Oxford dictionary. 

Twin paradox<====>31429<====>Twin paradox In physics, the twin paradox is a thought experiment in special relativity involving identical twins, one of whom makes a journey into space in a high-speed rocket and returns home to find that the twin who remained on Earth has aged more.  This result appears puzzling because each twin sees the other twin as moving, and so, according to an incorrect   and naive   application of time dilation and the principle of relativity, each should paradoxically find the other to have aged less.  However, this scenario can be resolved within the standard framework of special relativity: the travelling twin's trajectory involves two different inertial frames, one for the outbound journey and one for the inbound journey, and so there is no symmetry between the spacetime paths of the twins. 

Summary of Decameron tales<====>31430<====>Summary of Decameron talesDISPLAYTITLEThis article contains summaries and commentaries of the 100 stories within Giovanni Boccaccio's The Decameron. Each story of the Decameron begins with a short heading explaining the plot of the story.  The 1903 J.  M.  Rigg English translation headings are used in many of these summaries.  Commentary on the tale itself follows.  First dayBefore beginning the story-telling sessions, the ten young Florentines, seven women and three men, referred to as the Brigata,  gather at the Basilica di Santa Maria Novella and together decide to escape the Black Death by leaving the city to stay in a villa in the countryside for the next two weeks. 

The Book of the City of Ladies<====>31431<====>The Book of the City of Ladies  The Book of the City of Ladies or Le Livre de la Cité des Dames  (finished by 1405), is perhaps Christine de Pizan's most famous literary work, and it is her second work of lengthy prose.  Pizan uses the vernacular French language to compose the book, but she often uses Latin-style syntax and conventions within her French prose.  Forhan, Kate Langdon.  The Political Theory of Chrisine Pizan.  Burlington: Ashgate: 2002.  Print.  Women and Gender in the Early Mod.  World.   The book serves as her formal response to Jean de Meun's popular Roman de la Rose. 

Thorne Smith<====>31433<====>Thorne SmithJames Thorne Smith, Jr.  (March 27, 1892 – June 21, 1934) was an American writer of humorous supernatural fantasy fiction under the byline Thorne Smith.  He is best known today for the two Topper novels, comic fantasy fiction involving sex, much drinking and supernatural transformations.  With racy illustrations, these sold millions of copies in the 1930s and were equally popular in paperbacks of the 1950s. Smith drank as steadily as his characters; his appearance in James Thurber's The Years with Ross involves an unexplained week-long disappearance.   Smith was born in Annapolis, Maryland, the son of a Navy commodore, and attended Dartmouth College. 

The Sentinel (short story)<====>31434<====>The Sentinel (short story) "The Sentinel" is a short story  by British author Arthur C.  Clarke, written in 1948 and first published in 1951 as "Sentinel of Eternity", which was used as a starting point for the novel and film 2001: A Space Odyssey, where it was modified and fused with other ideas.  Clarke expressed impatience with its common description as the story on which the novel and movie are based.  He explained: "I am continually annoyed by careless references to 'The Sentinel' as 'the story on which 2001 is based'; it bears about as much relation to the movie as an acorn to the resultant full-grown oak. 

The Fountains of Paradise<====>31435<====>The Fountains of Paradise The Fountains of Paradise is a novel by British writer Arthur C.  Clarke.  Set in the 22nd century, it describes the construction of a space elevator.  This "orbital tower" is a giant structure rising from the ground and linking with a satellite in geostationary orbit at the height of approximately 36,000 kilometers (approx.  22,300 miles).  Such a structure would be used to raise payloads to orbit without the expense of using rockets.  The novel won both the  Hugo    and Nebula    Awards for Best Novel. 

Tagalog language<====>31438<====>Tagalog language Tagalog ( ;   ) is an Austronesian language spoken as a first language by a quarter of the population of the Philippines and as a second language by the majority.  Its standardized form, officially named Filipino, is  the national language of the Philippines, and is one of two official languages alongside English. It is related to other Philippine languages, such as the Bikol languages, Ilocano, the Visayan languages, Kapampangan, and Pangasinan, and more distantly to other Austronesian languages, such as the Formosan languages of Taiwan, Malay (Malaysian and Indonesian), Hawaiian, Māori, and Malagasy. History The word Tagalog is derived from the endonym taga-log ("river dweller"), composed of tagá- ("native of" or "from") and ilog ("river"). 

Tokamak<====>31439<====>Tokamak A tokamak  ( ) is a device that uses a powerful magnetic field to confine plasma in the shape of a torus.   The tokamak is one of the several types of magnetic confinement devices being developed to contain the hot plasma needed for producing controlled thermonuclear fusion power.   , it is the leading candidate for a practical fusion reactor. Tokamaks were invented in the 1950s by Soviet physicists Igor Tamm and Andrei Sakharov, inspired by an original idea of Oleg Lavrentiev.   In Russian, the word "tokamak" is an abbreviation for "toroidal chamber with magnetic coils" ( ). 

Turbopump<====>31440<====>Turbopump A turbopump is a propellant pump with two main components: a rotodynamic pump and a driving gas turbine, usually both mounted on the same shaft, or sometimes geared together.  The purpose of a turbopump is to produce a high-pressure fluid for feeding a combustion chamber or other use. There are two types of turbopumps: a centrifugal pump, where the pumping is done by throwing fluid outward at high speed, or an axial-flow pump, where alternating rotating and static blades progressively raise the pressure of a fluid. Axial-flow pumps have small diameters but give relatively modest pressure increases.  Although multiple compression stages are needed, axial flow pumps work well with low-density fluids. 

Tragedy of the anticommons<====>31441<====>Tragedy of the anticommonsThe tragedy of the anticommons is a type of coordination breakdown, in which a single resource has numerous rightsholders who prevent others from using it, frustrating what would be a socially desirable outcome.  It is a mirror-image of the older concept of tragedy of the commons, in which numerous rightsholders' combined use exceeds the capacity of a resource and depletes or destroys it.   The "tragedy of the anticommons" covers a range of coordination failures including patent thickets, and submarine patents.  Overcoming these breakdowns can be difficult, but there are assorted means, including eminent domain, laches, patent pools, or other licensing organizations. 

Thealogy<====>31444<====>Thealogy  Thealogy (a neologism derived from Ancient Greek   meaning "Goddess" and  , -logy, meaning "study of") is generally understood as a discourse that reflects upon the meaning of Goddess (thea) in contrast to God (theo).   As such, it is the study and reflection upon the feminine divine from a feminist perspective.  Thealogy is distinguished from feminist theology, which is the study of God from a feminist perspective,    but the two fields can be seen as related and interdependent.  History of the term The term's origin and initial use is open to continuing debate. 

Torpedo boat<====>31446<====>Torpedo boatA torpedo boat is a relatively small and fast naval ship designed to carry torpedoes into battle.  The first designs rammed enemy ships with explosive spar torpedoes, and later designs launched self-propelled Whitehead torpedoes.  They were created to counter battleships and other slow and heavily armed ships by using speed, agility, and the power of their torpedo weapons.   A number of inexpensive torpedo boats attacking en masse could overwhelm a larger ship's ability to fight them off using its large but cumbersome guns.  An inexpensive fleet of torpedo boats could pose a threat to much larger and more expensive fleets of capital ships, albeit only in the coastal areas to which their small size and limited fuel load restricted them. 

The Book of the Courtier<====>31447<====>The Book of the Courtier{{Infobox book<!--}} The Book of the Courtier (   ) is a courtesy book.  It was written by Baldassare Castiglione over the course of many years, beginning in 1508, and published in 1528 by the Aldine Press in Venice just before his death; an English edition was published in 1561.  It addresses the constitution of a perfect courtier, and in its last installment, a perfect lady. The Book of the Courtier is an example of the Renaissance dialogue, a literary form that incorporated elements of drama, conversation, philosophy, and essay.   Considered the definitive account of Renaissance court life, it is cited frequently along with Stefano Guazzo's The civil conversation (1574) and Giovanni Della Casa's Galateo (1558). 

Traceroute<====>31448<====>Traceroute In computing, traceroute is a computer network diagnostic tool for displaying the route (path) and measuring transit delays of packets across an Internet Protocol (IP) network.  The history of the route is recorded as the round-trip times of the packets received from each successive host (remote node) in the route (path); the sum of the mean times in each hop is a measure of the total time spent to establish the connection.  Traceroute proceeds unless all (three) sent packets are lost more than twice, then the connection is lost and the route cannot be evaluated.   Ping, on the other hand, only computes the final round-trip times from the destination point. 

Time to live<====>31449<====>Time to live Time to live (TTL) or hop limit is a mechanism that limits the lifespan or lifetime of data in a computer or network.  TTL may be implemented as a counter or timestamp attached to or embedded in the data.  Once the prescribed event count or timespan has elapsed, data is discarded.  In computer networking, TTL prevents a data packet from circulating indefinitely.  In computing applications, TTL is used to improve performance of caching. IP packetsUnder the Internet Protocol, TTL is an 8-bit field.  In the IPv4 header, TTL is the 9th octet of 20. 

Tel Aviv<====>31453<====>Tel Aviv    Tel Aviv ( ,  ,  ) is a major city in Israel, located on the country's Mediterranean coastline.  It is the financial center and the technology hub of Israel, with a population of  , making it Israel's second-largest city.   Tel Aviv is the largest city in its conurbation called Gush Dan (Dan's bloc) and its metropolitan area, which are Israel's largest and most populous by far.  Tel Aviv is also a focal point in the high-tech concentration known as the Silicon Wadi. Tel Aviv is governed by the Tel Aviv-Yafo Municipality, headed by Ron Huldai, and is home to many foreign embassies. 

Clangers<====>31454<====>Clangers    Clangers is a British stop-motion children's television series, comprising short films about a race (or perhaps a family) of creatures who live on, and inside, a small moon-like planet.  They speak only in whistles, and eat only green soup (supplied by the Soup Dragon) and blue string pudding.  The programmes were originally broadcast on BBC1 between 1969 and 1972, followed by a special episode which was broadcast in 1974. The series was made by Smallfilms, the company set up by Oliver Postgate (who was the show's writer, animator and narrator) and Peter Firmin (who was its modelmaker and illustrator).

He writes mainly epic fantasy, and has also written two movie novelizations.  He has written 23 New York Times bestsellers during his writing career,    and has over 21 million copies of his books in print.   He is one of the biggest-selling living fantasy writers.  Early lifeBrooks was born in the rural Midwestern town of Sterling, Illinois, and spent a large part of his life living there.He is an alumnus of Hamilton College, earning his B. 

Truck<====>31456<====>Truck    A truck or lorry is a motor vehicle designed to transport cargo.  Trucks vary greatly in size, power, and configuration; smaller varieties may be mechanically similar to some automobiles.  Commercial trucks can be very large and powerful, and may be configured to mount specialized equipment, such as in the case of fire trucks and concrete mixers and suction excavators. Modern trucks are largely powered by diesel engines, although small to medium size trucks with gasoline engines exist in the US, Canada, and Mexico.  In the European Union, vehicles with a gross combination mass of up to   are known as light commercial vehicles, and those over as large goods vehicles. 

Tamasay<====>31457<====>Tamasay A tamasay (or tamasai) is a bead necklace worn by Ainu women for special occasions. The necklace is called a shitoki if it has a medallion.   They are made with large glass beads the Ainu obtained through trading with Chinese merchants.   The Ainu also obtained glass beads secretly made by the Matsumae Clan.   The shitoki medallion often represents the white-tailed sea eagles that the Ainu hunt.   The more strands and beads a necklace has, the more valuable it is.   The necklaces are passed down through generations and are highly treasured by their owners. 

Thomas the Apostle<====>31459<====>Thomas the Apostle  Thomas the Apostle (called Didymus which means "the twin,” or Mar Thoma in Syriac) was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus, according to the New Testament. He is informally called Doubting Thomas because he doubted Jesus' resurrection when first told (in the Gospel of John account only), followed later by his confession of faith, "My Lord and my God,” on seeing Jesus' wounded body. Traditionally, he is said to have travelled outside the Roman Empire to preach the Gospel, travelling as far as Tamilakam which are the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala in present-day India.

The Smashing Pumpkins<====>31463<====>The Smashing Pumpkins  The Smashing Pumpkins (or Smashing Pumpkins)  are an American alternative rock band from Chicago, Illinois, formed in 1988.  Formed by frontman Billy Corgan (lead vocals, guitar) and James Iha (guitar), the band included D'arcy Wretzky (bass guitar) and Jimmy Chamberlin (drums) in its original incarnation.  It has undergone many line-up changes over the course of its existence, with the current lineup being Corgan and rhythm guitarist Jeff Schroeder. Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries,  they have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal,    dream pop, psychedelic rock,  progressive rock, shoegazing, and electronica in later recordings. 

Thomas Robert Malthus<====>31468<====>Thomas Robert Malthus    Thomas Robert Malthus   ( ; 13 February 1766 – 23 December 1834)  was an English cleric and scholar, influential in the fields of political economy and demography.  Petersen, William.  1979.  Malthus.  Heinemann, London.  2nd ed 1999.   Malthus himself used only his middle name, Robert.    In his 1798 book An Essay on the Principle of Population, Malthus observed that an increase in a nation's food production improved the well-being of the populace, but the improvement was temporary because it led to population growth, which in turn restored the original per capita production level. 

Tengwar<====>31469<====>Tengwar   The Tengwar  are an artificial script created by J.  R.  R.  Tolkien.  Within the fictional context of Tolkien's legendarium, the tengwar were invented by the Elf Fëanor, and used first to write the Elven tongues Quenya and Telerin.  Later a great number of languages of Middle-earth were written using the tengwar, including Sindarin.  Tolkien used tengwar to write English: most of Tolkien's tengwar samples are actually in English. Fictional history and terminologyAccording to The War of the Jewels (Appendix D to Quendi and Eldar), Fëanor, when he created his script, introduced a change in terminology. 

Tori Amos<====>31471<====>Tori Amos  Tori Amos (born Myra Ellen Amos,  August 22, 1963 ) is an American singer-songwriter, pianist and composer.  She is a classically trained musician with a mezzo-soprano vocal range.  Having already begun composing instrumental pieces on piano, Amos won a full scholarship to the Peabody Institute at Johns Hopkins University at the age of five, the youngest person ever to have been admitted.  She was expelled at the age of eleven for what Rolling Stone described as "musical insubordination. "  Amos was the lead singer of the short-lived 1980s pop group Y Kant Tori Read before achieving her breakthrough as a solo artist in the early 1990s. 

Transcription factor<====>31474<====>Transcription factor   In molecular biology, a transcription factor (TF) (or sequence-specific DNA-binding factor) is a protein that controls the rate of transcription of genetic information from DNA to messenger RNA, by binding to a specific DNA sequence.   The function of TFs is to regulate - turn on and off - genes in order to make sure that they are expressed in the right cell at the right time and in the right amount throughout the life of the cell and the organism.  Groups of TFs function in a coordinated fashion to direct cell division, cell growth, and cell death throughout life; cell migration and organization (body plan) during embryonic development; and intermittently in response to signals from outside the cell, such as a hormone.

It also ranks her fifth on the all-time list. CareerHattestad made her international debut at the 1981 European Junior Championships, finishing fifth.  The following year, at the age of just 16, she competed in the European Championships for seniors. 

Thebaine<====>31479<====>Thebaine Thebaine (paramorphine), also known as codeine methyl enol ether, is an opiate alkaloid, its name coming from the Greek Θῆβαι, Thēbai (Thebes), an ancient city in Upper Egypt.  A minor constituent of opium, thebaine is chemically similar to both morphine and codeine, but has stimulatory rather than depressant effects.   At high doses, it causes convulsions similar to strychnine poisoning.  The synthetic enantiomer (+)-thebaine does show analgesic effects apparently mediated through opioid receptors, unlike the inactive natural enantiomer (−)-thebaine.While thebaine is not used therapeutically, it is the main alkaloid extracted from Papaver bracteatum (Iranian poppy) and can be converted industrially into a variety of compounds, including oxycodone, oxymorphone, nalbuphine, naloxone, naltrexone, buprenorphine and etorphine. 

Theosophy<====>31480<====>Theosophy Theosophy is a collection of mystical and occultist philosophies  concerning, or seeking direct knowledge of the presumed mysteries of life and nature, particularly of the nature of divinity and the origin and purpose of the universe.   Theosophy is considered part of Western esotericism, which believes that hidden knowledge or wisdom from the ancient past offers a path to enlightenment and salvation. From the   the term theosophy has generally been used to refer to the religio-philosophic doctrines of the Theosophical Society, founded in New York City in 1875 by Helena Blavatsky, William Quan Judge, and Henry Steel Olcott. 

Tangent<====>31482<====>Tangent In geometry, the tangent line (or simply tangent) to a plane curve at a given point is the straight line that "just touches" the curve at that point.  Leibniz defined it as the line through a pair of infinitely close points on the curve.   More precisely, a straight line is said to be a tangent of a curve   at a point   on the curve if the line passes through the point   on the curve and has slope   where f   is the derivative of f.  A similar definition applies to space curves and curves in n-dimensional Euclidean space. 

Stonewall Jackson<====>31485<====>Stonewall Jackson   Thomas Jonathan "Stonewall" Jackson (January 21, 1824 – May 10, 1863) was a Confederate general during the American Civil War, and the best-known Confederate commander after General Robert E.  Lee.   Jackson played a prominent role in nearly all military engagements in the Eastern Theater of the war until his death, and played an important part in winning many significant battles. Jackson was born in what was then part of Virginia.  He received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point.  He served in the U. S.  Army during the Mexican–American War and distinguished himself at Chapultepec. 

Tertiary education<====>31486<====>Tertiary educationTertiary education, also referred to as third stage, third level, and post-secondary education, is the educational level following the completion of a school providing a secondary education.  The World Bank, for example, defines tertiary education as including universities as well as trade schools and colleges .  Higher education is taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education, while vocational education and training beyond secondary education is known as further education in the United Kingdom, or continuing education in the United States. Tertiary education generally culminates in the receipt of certificates, diplomas, or academic degrees. In the United Kingdom"Tertiary education" includes further education (FE), as well as higher education (HE). 

Trimix (breathing gas)<====>31489<====>Trimix (breathing gas) Trimix is a breathing gas consisting of oxygen, helium and nitrogen and is often used in deep commercial diving, during the deep phase of dives carried out using technical diving techniques,   and in advanced recreational diving.   The helium is included as a substitute for some of the nitrogen, to reduce the narcotic effect of the breathing gas at depth.  With a mixture of three gases it is possible to create mixes suitable for different depths or purposes by adjusting the proportions of each gas.  Oxygen content can be optimised for the depth to limit the risk of toxicity, and the inert component balanced between nitrogen (which is cheap but narcotic) and helium (which is not narcotic and reduces work of breathing, but is more expensive and increases heat loss). 

Theoretical chemistry<====>31491<====>Theoretical chemistry Theoretical chemistry is a branch of chemistry, which develops theoretical generalizations that are part of the theoretical arsenal of modern chemistry, for example, the concept of chemical bonding, chemical reaction, valence, the surface of potential energy, molecular orbitals, orbital interactions, molecule activation etc.  OverviewTheoretical chemistry unites principles and concepts common to all branches of chemistry.  Within the framework of theoretical chemistry, there is a systematization of chemical laws, principles and rules, their refinement and detailing, the construction of a hierarchy.  The central place in theoretical chemistry is occupied by the doctrine of the interconnection of the structure and properties of molecular systems. 

The Skeptical Environmentalist<====>31492<====>The Skeptical Environmentalist The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World ( , literal translation: The True State of the World) is a book by Danish environmentalist author Bjørn Lomborg, controversial for its claims that overpopulation, declining energy resources, deforestation, species loss, water shortages, certain aspects of global warming, and an assortment of other global environmental issues are unsupported by statistical analysis of the relevant data.  It was first published in Danish in 1998, while the English edition was published as a work in environmental economics by Cambridge University Press in 2001.  Due to the scope of the project, comprising the range of topics addressed, the diversity of data and sources employed, and the many types of conclusions and comments advanced, The Skeptical Environmentalist does not fit easily into a particular scientific discipline or methodology. 

Tricyclic antidepressant<====>31494<====>Tricyclic antidepressant Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are a class of medications that are used primarily as antidepressants.  TCAs were first discovered in the early 1950s and were marketed later in the decade.   They are named after their chemical structure, which contains three rings of atoms.  Tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs), which contain four rings of atoms, are a closely related group of antidepressant compounds. Although TCAs are sometimes prescribed for depressive disorders, they have been largely replaced in clinical use in most parts of the world by newer antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs). 

Ted Williams<====>31496<====>Ted Williams  Theodore Samuel Williams (August 30, 1918 – July 5, 2002) was an American professional baseball player and manager.  He played his entire 19-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career as a left fielder for the Boston Red Sox from 1939 to 1960, only interrupted by service time during World War II and the Korean War.  Nicknamed "The Kid", "The Splendid Splinter", "Teddy Ballgame", "The Thumper", and "The Greatest Hitter Who Ever Lived", Williams is regarded as one of the greatest players in baseball history.  Williams was also an outstanding fielder, especially in the difficult left field of Fenway Park in Boston. 

The Slits<====>31498<====>The Slits    The Slits were a British punk rock band formed in London in 1976 by members of the groups The Flowers of Romance and The Castrators.  The group's early line-up consisted of Ari Up (Ariane Forster) and Palmolive (a. k. a.  Paloma Romero, who played briefly with Spizzenergi and later left to join The Raincoats), with Viv Albertine and Tessa Pollitt replacing founding members Kate Korus and Suzy Gutsy.   Their 1979 debut album, Cut, has been called one of the defining releases of the post-punk era.  Career1976–1982The group supported The Clash on their 1977 White Riot tour along with Buzzcocks, The Prefects and Subway Sect. 

Turners<====>31500<====>Turners Turners ( ) are members of German-American gymnastic clubs. A German gymnastic movement was started by Turnvater ("father of gymnastics") Friedrich Ludwig Jahn in the early 19th century when Germany was occupied by Napoleon.  The Turnvereine ("gymnastic unions") were not only athletic, but also political, reflecting their origin in similar "nationalistic gymnastic" organizations in Europe.  The Turner movement in Germany was generally liberal in nature, and many Turners took part in the Revolution of 1848.   After its defeat, the movement was suppressed and many Turners left Germany, some emigrating to the United States.  Several of these Forty-Eighters went on to become Civil War soldiers, the great majority in the Union Army, and American politicians. 

Tim Burton<====>31501<====>Tim Burton   Timothy Walter Burton Tim Burton's middle name is cited as Walter by the Museum of Modern Art on its web appearance for a 2009 exhibition on Burton's artwork and a book covering Burton's career as an artist and filmmaker, though it is cited as William by other sources, such as the Tim Burton Collective.   ( ; born August 25, 1958) is an American film director, producer, artist, writer, and animator.  He is known for his dark, gothic, and eccentric horror and fantasy films such as Beetlejuice (1988), Edward Scissorhands (1990), The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), Ed Wood (1994), Sleepy Hollow (1999), Corpse Bride (2005), Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), Dark Shadows (2012), and Frankenweenie (2012).

Beyonder<====>31514<====>Beyonder  The Beyonder is a fictional cosmic entity appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.  Created by writer Jim Shooter    and artist Mike Zeck, the Beyonder first appeared in Secret Wars #1 (May 1984) as an unseen, nearly omnipotent being who kidnapped the heroes and villains of the Marvel Universe and had them do battle on another planet called Battleworld.  He later appeared in a more antagonistic role in the 1985 sequel Secret Wars II, in which he took human form, and threatened to destroy the Marvel multiverse.  Although he first took on a physical, humanoid form in Secret Wars II #2, it was in Secret Wars II #3 that he took on the permanent form in which he remained for the rest of his existence, that of a Caucasian human male with curly black hair. 

Tibet<====>31516<====>Tibet               "Greater Tibet" as claimed by Tibetan exile groups      Tibetan autonomous areas, as designated by China     Tibet Autonomous Region, within China    Chinese-controlled, claimed by India as part of Aksai ChinIndian-controlled, parts claimed by China as South TibetOther areas historically within the Tibetan cultural sphere    Tibet ( ;  , Tibetan Pinyin: boe w ,  ;   /ɕi⁵⁵ t͡sɑŋ⁵¹/) is a region on the Tibetan Plateau in Central Asia, spanning about 2.4 million km 2  and nearly a quarter of China's territory.  It is the traditional homeland of the Tibetan people as well as some other ethnic groups such as Monpa, Qiang, and Lhoba peoples and is now also inhabited by considerable numbers of Han Chinese and Hui people. Tibet is the highest region on Earth, with an average elevation of  .  The highest elevation in Tibet is Mount Everest, Earth's highest mountain, rising 8,848 m (29,029 ft) above sea level.The Tibetan Empire emerged in the 7th century, but with the fall of the empire the region soon divided into a variety of territories. The bulk of western and central Tibet (Ü-Tsang) was often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in Lhasa, Shigatse, or nearby locations; these governments were at various times under Mongol and Chinese overlordship. Thus Tibet remained a suzerainty of the Mongol and later Chinese rulers in Nanjing and Beijing, with reasonable autonomy given to the Tibetan leaders.    The eastern regions of Kham and Amdo often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure, being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups, while also often falling more directly under Chinese rule after the Battle of Chamdo. Most of this area was eventually incorporated into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai. The current borders of Tibet were generally established in the 18th century. Following the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing dynasty in 1912, Qing soldiers were disarmed and escorted out of Tibet Area (Ü-Tsang). The region subsequently declared its independence in 1913 without recognition by the subsequent Chinese Republican government.  Later, Lhasa took control of the western part of Xikang, China. The region maintained its autonomy until 1951 when, following the Battle of Chamdo, Tibet became incorporated into the People's Republic of China, and the previous Tibetan government was abolished in 1959 after a failed uprising.  Today, China governs western and central Tibet as the Tibet Autonomous Region while the eastern areas are now mostly ethnic autonomous prefectures within Sichuan, Qinghai and other neighbouring provinces. There are tensions regarding Tibet's political status    and dissident groups that are active in exile. Tibetan activists in Tibet have been arrested or tortured. The economy of Tibet is dominated by subsistence agriculture, though tourism has become a growing industry in recent decades. The dominant religion in Tibet is Tibetan Buddhism; in addition there is Bön, which is similar to Tibetan Buddhism,  and there are also Tibetan Muslims and Christian minorities. Tibetan Buddhism is a primary influence on the art, music, and festivals of the region. Tibetan architecture reflects Chinese and Indian influences. Staple foods in Tibet are roasted barley, yak meat, and butter tea.Names The Tibetan name for their land,  Bod  , means "Tibet" or "Tibetan Plateau", although it originally meant the central region  around Lhasa, now known in Tibetan as Ü. The Standard Tibetan pronunciation of Bod,  , is transcribed Bhö in Tournadre Phonetic Transcription, Bö in the THL Simplified Phonetic Transcription and Poi in Tibetan pinyin. Some scholars believe the first written reference to Bod "Tibet" was the ancient Bautai people recorded in the Egyptian Greek works Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (1st century CE) and Geographia (Ptolemy, 2nd century CE),  itself from the Sanskrit form Bhauṭṭa of the Indian geographical tradition. The modern Standard Chinese exonym for the ethnic Tibetan region is Zangqu ( ), which derives by metonymy from the Tsang region around Shigatse plus the addition of a Chinese suffix, 区 qū, which means "area, district, region, ward". Tibetan people, language, and culture, regardless of where they are from, are referred to as Zang ( ) although the geographical term Xīzàng is often limited to the Tibet Autonomous Region. The term Xīzàng was coined during the Qing dynasty in the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor (1796–1820) through the addition of a prefix meaning "west" (西 xī) to Zang.The best-known medieval Chinese name for Tibet is Tubo (  also written as   or  ;   or  ). This name first appears in Chinese characters as   in the 7th century (Li Tai) and as   in the 10th-century (Old Book of Tang describing 608–609 emissaries from Tibetan King Namri Songtsen to Emperor Yang of Sui). In the Middle Chinese spoken during that period, as reconstructed by William H. Baxter,   was pronounced thu -phjon and   was pronounced thu -pjon (with the   representing tone).   Other pre-modern Chinese names for Tibet include Wusiguo ( ; cf. Tibetan dbus, Ü,  ), Wusizang ( , cf. Tibetan dbus-gtsang, Ü-Tsang), Tubote ( ), and Tanggute ( , cf. Tangut). American Tibetologist Elliot Sperling has argued in favor of a recent tendency by some authors writing in Chinese to revive the term Tubote ( ) for modern use in place of Xizang, on the grounds that Tubote more clearly includes the entire Tibetan plateau rather than simply the Tibet Autonomous Region. The English word Tibet or Thibet dates back to the 18th century.  Historical linguists generally agree that "Tibet" names in European languages are loanwords from Semitic   or  ( ) ( ), itself deriving from Turkic  , literally: "The Heights" (plural of  ). Language Linguists generally classify the Tibetan language as a Tibeto-Burman language of the Sino-Tibetan language family although the boundaries between 'Tibetan' and certain other Himalayan languages can be unclear. According to Matthew Kapstein: From the perspective of historical linguistics, Tibetan most closely resembles Burmese among the major languages of Asia. Grouping these two together with other apparently related languages spoken in the Himalayan lands, as well as in the highlands of Southeast Asia and the Sino-Tibetan frontier regions, linguists have generally concluded that there exists a Tibeto-Burman family of languages. More controversial is the theory that the Tibeto-Burman family is itself part of a larger language family, called Sino-Tibetan, and that through it Tibetan and Burmese are distant cousins of Chinese.  The language has numerous regional dialects which are generally not mutually intelligible. It is employed throughout the Tibetan plateau and Bhutan and is also spoken in parts of Nepal and northern India, such as Sikkim. In general, the dialects of central Tibet (including Lhasa), Kham, Amdo and some smaller nearby areas are considered Tibetan dialects. Other forms, particularly Dzongkha, Sikkimese, Sherpa, and Ladakhi, are considered by their speakers, largely for political reasons, to be separate languages. However, if the latter group of Tibetan-type languages are included in the calculation, then 'greater Tibetan' is spoken by approximately 6 million people across the Tibetan Plateau. Tibetan is also spoken by approximately 150,000 exile speakers who have fled from modern-day Tibet to India and other countries.Although spoken Tibetan varies according to the region, the written language, based on Classical Tibetan, is consistent throughout. This is probably due to the long-standing influence of the Tibetan empire, whose rule embraced (and extended at times far beyond) the present Tibetan linguistic area, which runs from northern Pakistan in the west to Yunnan and Sichuan in the east, and from north of Qinghai Lake south as far as Bhutan. The Tibetan language has its own script which it shares with Ladakhi and Dzongkha, and which is derived from the ancient Indian Brāhmī script. Starting in 2001, the local deaf sign languages of Tibet were standardized, and Tibetan Sign Language is now being promoted across the country.The first Tibetan-English dictionary and grammar book was written by Alexander Csoma de Kőrös in 1834. History   Early history Humans inhabited the Tibetan Plateau at least 21,000 years ago.    This population was largely replaced around 3,000 BP by Neolithic immigrants from northern China, but there is a partial genetic continuity between the Paleolithic inhabitants and contemporary Tibetan populations. The earliest Tibetan historical texts identify the Zhang Zhung culture as a people who migrated from the Amdo region into what is now the region of Guge in western Tibet. Norbu 1989, pp. 127–128  Zhang Zhung is considered to be the original home of the Bön religion. Helmut Hoffman in McKay 2003 vol. 1, pp. 45–68  By the 1st century BCE, a neighboring kingdom arose in the Yarlung valley, and the Yarlung king, Drigum Tsenpo, attempted to remove the influence of the Zhang Zhung by expelling the Zhang's Bön priests from Yarlung. Karmey 2001, p. 66ff  He was assassinated and Zhang Zhung continued its dominance of the region until it was annexed by Songtsen Gampo in the 7th century. Prior to Songtsen Gampo, the kings of Tibet were more mythological than factual, and there is insufficient evidence of their existence. Tibetan Empire The history of a unified Tibet begins with the rule of Songtsen Gampo (604–650 CE), who united parts of the Yarlung River Valley and founded the Tibetan Empire. He also brought in many reforms, and Tibetan power spread rapidly, creating a large and powerful empire. It is traditionally considered that his first wife was the Princess of Nepal, Bhrikuti, and that she played a great role in the establishment of Buddhism in Tibet. In 640 he married Princess Wencheng, the niece of the powerful Chinese emperor Taizong of Tang China. Under the next few Tibetan kings, Buddhism became established as the state religion and Tibetan power increased even further over large areas of Central Asia, while major inroads were made into Chinese territory, even reaching the Tang's capital Chang'an (modern Xi'an) in late 763.  However, the Tibetan occupation of Chang'an only lasted for fifteen days, after which they were defeated by Tang and its ally, the Turkic Uyghur Khaganate.The Kingdom of Nanzhao (in Yunnan and neighbouring regions) remained under Tibetan control from 750 to 794, when they turned on their Tibetan overlords and helped the Chinese inflict a serious defeat on the Tibetans. In 747, the hold of Tibet was loosened by the campaign of general Gao Xianzhi, who tried to re-open the direct communications between Central Asia and Kashmir. By 750, the Tibetans had lost almost all of their central Asian possessions to the Chinese. However, after Gao Xianzhi's defeat by the Arabs and Qarluqs at the Battle of Talas (751) and the subsequent civil war known as the An Lushan Rebellion (755), Chinese influence decreased rapidly and Tibetan influence resumed.At its height in the 780's to 790's the Tibetan Empire reached its highest glory when it ruled and controlled a territory stretching from modern day Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burma, China, India,  Nepal, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan.In 821/822 CE Tibet and China signed a peace treaty. A bilingual account of this treaty, including details of the borders between the two countries, is inscribed on a stone pillar which stands outside the Jokhang temple in Lhasa.  Tibet continued as a Central Asian empire until the mid-9th century, when a civil war over succession led to the collapse of imperial Tibet. The period that followed is known traditionally as the Era of Fragmentation, when political control over Tibet became divided between regional warlords and tribes with no dominant centralized authority. An Islamic invasion from Bengal took place in 1206.Yuan dynasty The Mongol Yuan dynasty, through the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs, or Xuanzheng Yuan, ruled Tibet through a top-level administrative department. One of the department's purposes was to select a dpon-chen ('great administrator'), usually appointed by the lama and confirmed by the Mongol emperor in Beijing. Dawa Norbu. China's Tibet Policy, pp. 139. Psychology Press.  The Sakya lama retained a degree of autonomy, acting as the political authority of the region, while the dpon-chen held administrative and military power. Mongol rule of Tibet remained separate from the main provinces of China, but the region existed under the administration of the Yuan dynasty. If the Sakya lama ever came into conflict with the dpon-chen, the dpon-chen had the authority to send Chinese troops into the region. Tibet retained nominal power over religious and regional political affairs, while the Mongols managed a structural and administrative  rule over the region, reinforced by the rare military intervention. This existed as a "diarchic structure" under the Yuan emperor, with power primarily in favor of the Mongols.  Mongolian prince Khuden gained temporal power in Tibet in the 1240s and sponsored Sakya Pandita, whose seat became the capital of Tibet. Drogön Chögyal Phagpa, Sakya Pandita's nephew became Imperial Preceptor of Kublai Khan, founder of the Yuan dynasty.Yuan control over the region ended with the Ming overthrow of the Yuan and Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen's revolt against the Mongols. Rossabi 1983, p. 194  Following the uprising, Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen founded the Phagmodrupa Dynasty, and sought to reduce Yuan influences over Tibetan culture and politics. Phagmodrupa, Rinpungpa and Tsangpa Dynasties  Between 1346 and 1354, Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen toppled the Sakya and founded the Phagmodrupa Dynasty. The following 80 years saw the founding of the Gelug school (also known as Yellow Hats) by the disciples of Je Tsongkhapa, and the founding of the important Ganden, Drepung and Sera monasteries near Lhasa. However, internal strife within the dynasty and the strong localism of the various fiefs and political-religious factions led to a long series of internal conflicts. The minister family Rinpungpa, based in Tsang (West Central Tibet), dominated politics after 1435. In 1565 they were overthrown by the Tsangpa Dynasty of Shigatse which expanded its power in different directions of Tibet in the following decades and favoured the Karma Kagyu sect.Rise of Ganden Phodrang  In 1578, Altan Khan of the Tümed Mongols gave Sonam Gyatso, a high lama of the Gelugpa school, the name Dalai Lama, Dalai being the Mongolian translation of the Tibetan name Gyatso "Ocean". The 5th Dalai Lama is known for unifying the Tibetan heartland under the control of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, after defeating the rival Kagyu and Jonang sects and the secular ruler, the Tsangpa prince, in a prolonged civil war. His efforts were successful in part because of aid from Güshi Khan, the Oirat leader of the Khoshut Khanate. With Güshi Khan as a largely uninvolved overlord, the 5th Dalai Lama and his intimates established a civil administration which is referred to by historians as the Lhasa state. This Tibetan regime or government is also referred to as the Ganden Phodrang.Qing dynasty Qing dynasty rule in Tibet began with their 1720 expedition to the country when they expelled the invading Dzungars. Amdo came under Qing control in 1724, and eastern Kham was incorporated into neighbouring Chinese provinces in 1728. Wang Jiawei, "The Historical Status of China's Tibet", 2000, pp. 162–6.  Meanwhile, the Qing government sent resident commissioners called Ambans to Lhasa. In 1750 the Ambans and the majority of the Han Chinese and Manchus living in Lhasa were killed in a riot, and Qing troops arrived quickly and suppressed the rebels in the next year. Like the preceding Yuan dynasty, the Manchus of the Qing dynasty exerted military and administrative control of the region, while granting it a degree of political autonomy. The Qing commander publicly executed a number of supporters of the rebels and, as in 1723 and 1728, made changes in the political structure and drew up a formal organization plan. The Qing now restored the Dalai Lama as ruler, leading the governing council called Kashag,  but elevated the role of Ambans to include more direct involvement in Tibetan internal affairs. At the same time the Qing took steps to counterbalance the power of the aristocracy by adding officials recruited from the clergy to key posts. For several decades, peace reigned in Tibet, but in 1792 the Qing Qianlong Emperor sent a large Chinese army into Tibet to push the invading Nepalese out. This prompted yet another Qing reorganization of the Tibetan government, this time through a written plan called the "Twenty-Nine Regulations for Better Government in Tibet". Qing military garrisons staffed with Qing troops were now also established near the Nepalese border.  Tibet was dominated by the Manchus in various stages in the 18th century, and the years immediately following the 1792 regulations were the peak of the Qing imperial commissioners' authority; but there was no attempt to make Tibet a Chinese province. In 1834 the Sikh Empire invaded and annexed Ladakh, a culturally Tibetan region that was an independent kingdom at the time. Seven years later a Sikh army led by General Zorawar Singh invaded western Tibet from Ladakh, starting the Sino-Sikh War. A Qing-Tibetan army repelled the invaders but was in turn defeated when it chased the Sikhs into Ladakh. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Chushul between the Chinese and Sikh empires. As the Qing dynasty weakened, its authority over Tibet also gradually declined, and by the mid-19th century its influence was minuscule. Qing authority over Tibet had become more symbolic than real by the late 19th century,although in the 1860s the Tibetans still chose for reasons of their own to emphasize the empire's symbolic authority and make it seem substantial. This period also saw some contacts with Jesuits and Capuchins from Europe, and in 1774 a Scottish nobleman, George Bogle, came to Shigatse to investigate prospects of trade for the British East India Company.  However, in the 19th century the situation of foreigners in Tibet grew more tenuous. The British Empire was encroaching from northern India into the Himalayas, the Emirate of Afghanistan and the Russian Empire were expanding into Central Asia and each power became suspicious of the others' intentions in Tibet.In 1904, a British expedition to Tibet, spurred in part by a fear that Russia was extending its power into Tibet as part of The Great Game, invaded the country, hoping that negotiations with the 13th Dalai Lama would be more effective than with Chinese representatives. Smith 1996, pp. 154–6  When the British-led invasion reached Tibet on December 12, 1903, an armed confrontation with the ethnic Tibetans resulted in the Massacre of Chumik Shenko, which resulted in 600 fatalities amongst the Tibetan forces, compared to only 12 on the British side.   Afterwards, in 1904 Francis Younghusband imposed a treaty known as the Treaty of Lhasa, which was subsequently repudiated and was succeeded by a 1906 treaty  signed between Britain and China.In 1910, the Qing government sent a military expedition of its own under Zhao Erfeng to establish direct Manchu-Chinese rule and, in an imperial edict, deposed the Dalai Lama, who fled to British India. Zhao Erfeng defeated the Tibetan military conclusively and expelled the Dalai Lama's forces from the province. His actions were unpopular, and there was much animosity against him for his mistreatment of civilians and disregard for local culture.Post-Qing period After the Xinhai Revolution (1911–12) toppled the Qing dynasty and the last Qing troops were escorted out of Tibet, the new Republic of China apologized for the actions of the Qing and offered to restore the Dalai Lama's title.  The Dalai Lama refused any Chinese title and declared himself ruler of an independent Tibet. Shakya 1999, pg. 5  In 1913, Tibet and Mongolia concluded a treaty of mutual recognition.  For the next 36 years, the 13th Dalai Lama and the regents who succeeded him governed Tibet. During this time, Tibet fought Chinese warlords for control of the ethnically Tibetan areas in Xikang and Qinghai (parts of Kham and Amdo) along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Wang Jiawei, "The Historical Status of China's Tibet", 2000, p. 150.  In 1914 the Tibetan government signed the Simla Accord with Britain, ceding the South Tibet region to British India. The Chinese government denounced the agreement as illegal.    When in the 1930s and 1940s the regents displayed negligence in affairs, the Kuomintang Government of the Republic of China took advantage of this to expand its reach into the territory. From 1950 to present Emerging with control over most of mainland China after the Chinese Civil War, the People's Republic of China incorporated Tibet in 1950 and negotiated the Seventeen Point Agreement with the newly enthroned 14th Dalai Lama's government, affirming the People's Republic of China's sovereignty but granting the area autonomy. Subsequently, on his journey into exile, the 14th Dalai Lama completely repudiated the agreement, which he has repeated on many occasions.   The Chinese used the Dalai Lama to be able to have control of the military's training and actions. The Dalai Lama had a strong following as many people from Tibet looked at him as their leader from not just a political point of view, but also from a spiritual perspective.  After the Dalai Lama's government fled to Dharamsala, India, during the 1959 Tibetan Rebellion, it established a rival government-in-exile. Afterwards, the Central People's Government in Beijing renounced the agreement and began implementation of the halted social and political reforms.  During the Great Leap Forward, between 200,000 and 1,000,000 Tibetans died,  and approximately 6,000 monasteries were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, thus the vast majority of historic Tibetan architecture was destroyed.    In 1962 China and India fought a brief war over the disputed South Tibet and Aksai Chin regions. Although China won the war, Chinese troops withdrew north of the McMahon Line, effectively ceding South Tibet to India. In 1980, General Secretary and reformist Hu Yaobang visited Tibet and ushered in a period of social, political, and economic liberalization.  At the end of the decade, however, before the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, monks in the Drepung and Sera monasteries started protesting for independence, and so the government halted reforms and started an anti-separatist campaign.    Human rights organisations have been critical of the Beijing and Lhasa governments' approach to human rights in the region when cracking down on separatist convulsions that have occurred around monasteries and cities, most recently in the 2008 Tibetan unrest.Geography All of modern China, including Tibet, is considered a part of East Asia.  Historically, some European sources also considered parts of Tibet to lie in Central Asia. Tibet is west of the Central China plain, and within mainland China Tibet is regarded as part of 西部 (Xībù), a term usually translated by Chinese media as "the Western section", meaning "Western China".Tibet has some of the world's tallest mountains, with several of them making the top ten list. Mount Everest, located on the border with Nepal, is, at  , the highest mountain on earth. Several major rivers have their source in the Tibetan Plateau (mostly in present-day Qinghai Province). These include the Yangtze, Yellow River, Indus River, Mekong, Ganges, Salween and the Yarlung Tsangpo River (Brahmaputra River).  The Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon, along the Yarlung Tsangpo River, is among the deepest and longest canyons in the world.Tibet has been called the "Water Tower" of Asia, and China is investing heavily in water projects in Tibet.  The Indus and Brahmaputra rivers originate from a lake (Tib: Tso Mapham) in Western Tibet, near Mount Kailash. The mountain is a holy pilgrimage site for both Hindus and Tibetans. The Hindus consider the mountain to be the abode of Lord Shiva. The Tibetan name for Mt. Kailash is Khang Rinpoche. Tibet has numerous high-altitude lakes referred to in Tibetan as tso or co. These include Qinghai Lake, Lake Manasarovar, Namtso, Pangong Tso, Yamdrok Lake, Siling Co, Lhamo La-tso, Lumajangdong Co, Lake Puma Yumco, Lake Paiku, Como Chamling, Lake Rakshastal, Dagze Co and Dong Co. The Qinghai Lake (Koko Nor) is the largest lake in the People's Republic of China.The atmosphere is severely dry nine months of the year, and average annual snowfall is only  , due to the rain shadow effect. Western passes receive small amounts of fresh snow each year but remain traversible all year round. Low temperatures are prevalent throughout these western regions, where bleak desolation is unrelieved by any vegetation bigger than a low bush, and where wind sweeps unchecked across vast expanses of arid plain. The Indian monsoon exerts some influence on eastern Tibet. Northern Tibet is subject to high temperatures in the summer and intense cold in the winter.Cultural Tibet consists of several regions. These include Amdo (A mdo) in the northeast, which is administratively part of the provinces of Qinghai, Gansu and Sichuan. Kham (Khams) in the southeast encompasses parts of western Sichuan, northern Yunnan, southern Qinghai and the eastern part of the Tibet Autonomous Region. Ü-Tsang (dBus gTsang) (Ü in the center, Tsang in the center-west, and Ngari (mNga' ris) in the far west) covered the central and western portion of Tibet Autonomous Region. Tibetan cultural influences extend to the neighboring states of Bhutan, Nepal, regions of India such as Sikkim, Ladakh, Lahaul, and Spiti, Northern Pakistan baltistan or Balti-yul in addition to designated Tibetan autonomous areas in adjacent Chinese provinces.Cities, towns and villages There are over 800 settlements in Tibet. Lhasa is Tibet's traditional capital and the capital of Tibet Autonomous Region. It contains two world heritage sites – the Potala Palace and Norbulingka, which were the residences of the Dalai Lama. Lhasa contains a number of significant temples and monasteries, including Jokhang and Ramoche Temple.Shigatse is the second largest city in the Tibet AR, west of Lhasa. Gyantse and Qamdo are also amongst the largest.Other cities and towns in cultural Tibet include Shiquanhe (Ali), Nagchu, Bamda, Rutog, Nyingchi, Nedong, Coqên, Barkam, Sakya, Gartse, Pelbar, Lhatse, and Tingri; in Sichuan, Kangding (Dartsedo); in Qinghai, Jyekundo (Yushu), Machen, and Golmud; in India, Tawang, Leh, and Gangtok , In Pakistan Skardu , khapuluGovernment The central region of Tibet is an autonomous region within China, the Tibet Autonomous Region. The Tibet Autonomous Region is a province-level entity of the People's Republic of China. It is governed by a People's Government, led by a Chairman. In practice, however, the Chairman is subordinate to the branch secretary of the Communist Party of China. As a matter of convention, the Chairman has almost always been an ethnic Tibetan, while the party secretary has always been ethnically non-Tibetan. Economy  The Tibetan economy is dominated by subsistence agriculture. Due to limited arable land, the primary occupation of the Tibetan Plateau is raising livestock, such as sheep, cattle, goats, camels, yaks, dzo, and horses. The main crops grown are barley, wheat, buckwheat, rye, potatoes, and assorted fruits and vegetables. Tibet is ranked the lowest among China’s 31 provinces  on the Human Development Index according to UN Development Programme data.   In recent years, due to increased interest in Tibetan Buddhism, tourism has become an increasingly important sector, and is actively promoted by the authorities.  Tourism brings in the most income from the sale of handicrafts. These include Tibetan hats, jewelry (silver and gold), wooden items, clothing, quilts, fabrics, Tibetan rugs and carpets. The Central People's Government exempts Tibet from all taxation and provides 90% of Tibet's government expenditures.However most of this investment goes to pay migrant workers who do not settle in Tibet and send much of their income home to other provinces. 40% of the rural cash income in the Tibet Autonomous Region is derived from the harvesting of the fungus Cordyceps sinensis; contributing at least 1.8 billion yuan, (225 million USD) to the region’s GDP. The Qingzang railway linking the Tibet Autonomous Region to Qinghai Province was opened in 2006, but not without controversy.In January 2007, the Chinese government issued a report outlining the discovery of a large mineral deposit under the Tibetan Plateau.The deposit has an estimated value of $128 billion and may double Chinese reserves of zinc, copper, and lead. The Chinese government sees this as a way to alleviate the nation's dependence on foreign mineral imports for its growing economy. However, critics worry that mining these vast resources will harm Tibet's fragile ecosystem and undermine Tibetan culture. On January 15, 2009, China announced the construction of Tibet’s first expressway, a   stretch of controlled-access highway in southwestern Lhasa. The project will cost 1.55 billion yuan (US$227 million). From January 18–20, 2010 a national conference on Tibet and areas inhabited by Tibetans in Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu and Qinghai was held in China and a substantial plan to improve development of the areas was announced. The conference was attended by General secretary Hu Jintao, Wu Bangguo, Wen Jiabao, Jia Qinglin, Li Changchun, Xi Jinping, Li Keqiang, He Guoqiang and Zhou Yongkang, all members of CPC Politburo Standing Committee signaling the commitment of senior Chinese leaders to development of Tibet and ethnic Tibetan areas. The plan calls for improvement of rural Tibetan income to national standards by 2020 and free education for all rural Tibetan children. China has invested 310 billion yuan (about 45.6 billion U.S. dollars) in Tibet since 2001. "Tibet's GDP was expected to reach 43.7 billion yuan in 2009, up 170 percent from that in 2000 and posting an annual growth of 12.3 percent over the past nine years." Development zoneThe State Council approved Tibet Lhasa Economic and Technological Development Zone as a state-level development zone in 2001. It is located in the western suburbs of Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region. It is   away from the Gonggar Airport, and   away from Lhasa Railway Station and    away from 318 national highway.The zone has a planned area of   and is divided into two zones. Zone A developed a land area of   for construction purposes. It is a flat zone, and has the natural conditions for good drainage. Demographics Historically, the population of Tibet consisted of primarily ethnic Tibetans and some other ethnic groups. According to tradition the original ancestors of the Tibetan people, as represented by the six red bands in the Tibetan flag, are: the Se, Mu, Dong, Tong, Dru and Ra. Other traditional ethnic groups with significant population or with the majority of the ethnic group residing in Tibet (excluding a disputed area with India) include Bai people, Blang, Bonan, Dongxiang, Han, Hui people, Lhoba, Lisu people, Miao, Mongols, Monguor (Tu people), Menba (Monpa), Mosuo, Nakhi, Qiang, Nu people, Pumi, Salar, and Yi people.The proportion of the non-Tibetan population in Tibet is disputed. On the one hand, the Central Tibetan Administration of the Dalai Lama accuses China of actively swamping Tibet with migrants in order to alter Tibet's demographic makeup.On the other hand, according to the 2010 Chinese census ethnic Tibetans comprise 90% of a total population of 3 million in the Tibet Autonomous Region.  Exact population numbers probably depend on how temporary migrants are counted. Culture Religion Buddhism Religion is extremely important to the Tibetans and has a strong influence over all aspects of their lives. Bön is the indigenous religion of Tibet, but has been almost eclipsed by Tibetan Buddhism, a distinctive form of Mahayana and Vajrayana, which was introduced into Tibet from the Sanskrit Buddhist tradition of northern India.  Tibetan Buddhism is practiced not only in Tibet but also in Mongolia, parts of northern India, the Buryat Republic, the Tuva Republic, and in the Republic of Kalmykia and some other parts of China. During China's Cultural Revolution, nearly all Tibet's monasteries were ransacked and destroyed by the Red Guards. Tibetan monks: A controlled life. BBC News. March 20, 2008.    A few monasteries have begun to rebuild since the 1980s (with limited support from the Chinese government) and greater religious freedom has been granted – although it is still limited. Monks returned to monasteries across Tibet and monastic education resumed even though the number of monks imposed is strictly limited.    Before the 1950s, between 10 and 20% of males in Tibet were monks. Tibetan Buddhism has four main traditions (the suffix pa is comparable to "er" in English):Gelug(pa), Way of Virtue, also known casually as Yellow Hat, whose spiritual head is the Ganden Tripa and whose temporal head is the Dalai Lama. Successive Dalai Lamas ruled Tibet from the mid-17th to mid-20th centuries. This order was founded in the 14th to 15th centuries by Je Tsongkhapa, based on the foundations of the Kadampa tradition. Tsongkhapa was renowned for both his scholasticism and his virtue. The Dalai Lama belongs to the Gelugpa school, and is regarded as the embodiment of the Bodhisattva of Compassion. Kagyu(pa), Oral Lineage. This contains one major subsect and one minor subsect. The first, the Dagpo Kagyu, encompasses those Kagyu schools that trace back to Gampopa. In turn, the Dagpo Kagyu consists of four major sub-sects: the Karma Kagyu, headed by a Karmapa, the Tsalpa Kagyu, the Barom Kagyu, and Pagtru Kagyu. The once-obscure Shangpa Kagyu, which was famously represented by the 20th-century teacher Kalu Rinpoche, traces its history back to the Indian master Niguma, sister of Kagyu lineage holder Naropa. This is an oral tradition which is very much concerned with the experiential dimension of meditation. Its most famous exponent was Milarepa, an 11th-century mystic.Nyingma(pa), The Ancient Ones. This is the oldest, the original order founded by Padmasambhava.Sakya(pa), Grey Earth, headed by the Sakya Trizin, founded by Khon Konchog Gyalpo, a disciple of the great translator Drokmi Lotsawa. Sakya Pandita 1182–1251 CE was the great grandson of Khon Konchog Gyalpo. This school emphasizes scholarship.ChristianityThe first Christians documented to have reached Tibet were the Nestorians, of whom various remains and inscriptions have been found in Tibet. They were also present at the imperial camp of Möngke Khan at Shira Ordo, where they debated in 1256 with Karma Pakshi (1204/6-83), head of the Karma Kagyu order.   Desideri, who reached Lhasa in 1716, encountered Armenian and Russian merchants. Roman Catholic Jesuits and Capuchins arrived from Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries. Portuguese missionaries Jesuit Father António de Andrade and Brother Manuel Marques first reached the kingdom of Gelu in western Tibet in 1624 and was welcomed by the royal family who allowed them to build a church later on.   By 1627, there were about a hundred local converts in the Guge kingdom.  Later on, Christianity was introduced to Rudok, Ladakh and Tsang and was welcomed by the ruler of the Tsang kingdom, where Andrade and his fellows established a Jesuit outpost at Shigatse in 1626. In 1661 another Jesuit, Johann Grueber, crossed Tibet from Sining to Lhasa (where he spent a month), before heading on to Nepal.  He was followed by others who actually built a church in Lhasa. These included the Jesuit Father Ippolito Desideri, 1716–1721, who gained a deep knowledge of Tibetan culture, language and Buddhism, and various Capuchins in 1707–1711, 1716–1733 and 1741–1745, Stein 1972, p. 85  Christianity was used by some Tibetan monarchs and their courts and the Karmapa sect lamas to counterbalance the influence of the Gelugpa sect in the 17th century until in 1745 when all the missionaries were expelled at the lama's insistence.   In 1877, the Protestant James Cameron from the China Inland Mission walked from Chongqing to Batang in Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan province, and "brought the Gospel to the Tibetan people."  Beginning in the 20th century, in Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan, a large number of Lisu people and some Yi and Nu people converted to Christianity. Famous earlier missionaries include James O. Fraser, Alfred James Broomhall and Isobel Kuhn of the China Inland Mission, among others who were active in this area.  Proselytising has been illegal in China since 1949. But  , many Christian missionaries were reported to be active in Tibet with the tacit approval of Chinese authorities, who view the missionaries as a counterforce to Tibetan Buddhism or as a boon to the local economy. Islam Muslims have been living in Tibet since as early as the 8th or 9th century. In Tibetan cities, there are small communities of Muslims, known as Kachee (Kache), who trace their origin to immigrants from three main regions: Kashmir (Kachee Yul in ancient Tibetan), Ladakh and the Central Asian Turkic countries. Islamic influence in Tibet also came from Persia. A Muslim Sufi Syed Ali Hamdani  preached the people of Baltistan then known as little Tibet . Which became main cause of the cultural separation of the people of Baltistan from the mainstream Tibet . After 1959 a group of Tibetan Muslims made a case for Indian nationality based on their historic roots to Kashmir and the Indian government declared all Tibetan Muslims Indian citizens later on that year.  Other Muslim ethnic groups who have long inhabited Tibet include Hui, Salar, Dongxiang and Bonan. There is also a well established Chinese Muslim community (gya kachee), which traces its ancestry back to the Hui ethnic group of China.Tibetan art Tibetan representations of art are intrinsically bound with Tibetan Buddhism and commonly depict deities or variations of Buddha in various forms from bronze Buddhist statues and shrines, to highly colorful thangka paintings and mandalas.Architecture Tibetan architecture contains Chinese and Indian influences, and reflects a deeply Buddhist approach. The Buddhist wheel, along with two dragons, can be seen on nearly every Gompa in Tibet. The design of the Tibetan Chörtens can vary, from roundish walls in Kham to squarish, four-sided walls in Ladakh.The most distinctive feature of Tibetan architecture is that many of the houses and monasteries are built on elevated, sunny sites facing the south, and are often made out of a mixture of rocks, wood, cement and earth. Little fuel is available for heat or lighting, so flat roofs are built to conserve heat, and multiple windows are constructed to let in sunlight. Walls are usually sloped inwards at 10 degrees as a precaution against the frequent earthquakes in this mountainous area.Standing at   in height and   in width, the Potala Palace is the most important example of Tibetan architecture. Formerly the residence of the Dalai Lama, it contains over one thousand rooms within thirteen stories, and houses portraits of the past Dalai Lamas and statues of the Buddha. It is divided between the outer White Palace, which serves as the administrative quarters, and the inner Red Quarters, which houses the assembly hall of the Lamas, chapels, 10,000 shrines, and a vast library of Buddhist scriptures. The Potala Palace is a World Heritage Site, as is Norbulingka, the former summer residence of the Dalai Lama.Music The music of Tibet reflects the cultural heritage of the trans-Himalayan region, centered in Tibet but also known wherever ethnic Tibetan groups are found in India, Bhutan, Nepal and further abroad. First and foremost Tibetan music is religious music, reflecting the profound influence of Tibetan Buddhism on the culture.Tibetan music often involves chanting in Tibetan or Sanskrit, as an integral part of the religion. These chants are complex, often recitations of sacred texts or in celebration of various festivals. Yang chanting, performed without metrical timing, is accompanied by resonant drums and low, sustained syllables. Other styles include those unique to the various schools of Tibetan Buddhism, such as the classical music of the popular Gelugpa school, and the romantic music of the Nyingmapa, Sakyapa and Kagyupa schools. Nangma dance music is especially popular in the karaoke bars of the urban center of Tibet, Lhasa. Another form of popular music is the classical gar style, which is performed at rituals and ceremonies. Lu are a type of songs that feature glottal vibrations and high pitches. There are also epic bards who sing of Gesar, who is a hero to ethnic Tibetans.Festivals Tibet has various festivals that are commonly performed to worship the Buddha  throughout the year. Losar is the Tibetan New Year Festival. Preparations for the festive event are manifested by special offerings to family shrine deities, painted doors with religious symbols, and other painstaking jobs done to prepare for the event. Tibetans eat Guthuk (barley noodle soup with filling) on New Year's Eve with their families. The Monlam Prayer Festival follows it in the first month of the Tibetan calendar, falling between the fourth and the eleventh days of the first Tibetan month. It involves dancing and participating in sports events, as well as sharing picnics. The event was established in 1049 by Tsong Khapa, the founder of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama's order.Cuisine  The most important crop in Tibet is barley, and dough made from barley flour—called tsampa—is the staple food of Tibet. This is either rolled into noodles or made into steamed dumplings called momos. Meat dishes are likely to be yak, goat, or mutton, often dried, or cooked into a spicy stew with potatoes. Mustard seed is cultivated in Tibet, and therefore features heavily in its cuisine. Yak yogurt, butter and cheese are frequently eaten, and well-prepared yogurt is considered something of a prestige item. Butter tea is very popular to drink.See also Central Tibetan AdministrationHuman rights in TibetIndex of Tibet-related articlesMajor national historical and cultural sites in TibetOutline of TibetTibet Area (administrative division)Tibetan independence movementTibet flag caseNotes References Beckwith, Christopher I.

Flash (comics)<====>31519<====>Flash (comics)    {{Infobox comics set index }}The Flash (or simply Flash) is the name of several superheroes appearing in comic books published by DC Comics.  Created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Harry Lampert, the original Flash first appeared in Flash Comics #1 (cover date January 1940/release month November 1939).Nicknamed the "Scarlet Speedster", all incarnations of the Flash possess "super speed", which includes the ability to run, move, and think extremely fast, use superhuman reflexes, and seemingly violate certain laws of physics. Thus far, at least four different characters—each of whom somehow gained the power of "the speed force"—have assumed the mantle of the Flash in DC's history: college athlete Jay Garrick (1940–1951, 1961–2011, 2017–present), forensic scientist Barry Allen (1956–1985, 2008–present), Barry's nephew Wally West (1986–2011, 2016–present), and Barry's grandson Bart Allen (2006–2007). 

Hellfire Club<====>31520<====>Hellfire Club  Hellfire Club was a name for several exclusive clubs for high society rakes established in Britain and Ireland in the 18th century.  The name is most commonly used to refer to Sir Francis Dashwood's Order of the Friars of St.  Francis of Wycombe.   Such clubs were rumoured to be the meeting places of "persons of quality" Ashe p. 48  who wished to take part in socially perceived immoral acts, and the members were often involved in politics.  Neither the activities nor membership of the club are easy to ascertain, for the clubs were rumoured to have distant ties to an elite society known only as The Order of the Second Circle. 

Thomas Hunt Morgan<====>31522<====>Thomas Hunt Morgan   Thomas Hunt Morgan (September 25, 1866 – December 4, 1945)    was an American evolutionary biologist, geneticist, embryologist, and science author who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in  1933 for discoveries elucidating the role that the chromosome plays in heredity.    Morgan received his Ph. D.  from Johns Hopkins University in zoology in 1890 and researched embryology during his tenure at Bryn Mawr.  Following the rediscovery of Mendelian inheritance in 1900, Morgan began to study the genetic characteristics of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.  In his famous Fly Room at Columbia University, Morgan demonstrated that genes are carried on chromosomes and are the mechanical basis of heredity. 

The Avengers (TV series)<====>31523<====>The Avengers (TV series)  The Avengers is an espionage British television series created in 1961.  It initially focused on Dr.  David Keel (Ian Hendry),    aided by John Steed (Patrick Macnee).  Hendry left after the first series; Steed then became the main character, partnered by a succession of assistants.  His most famous assistants were intelligent, stylish and assertive women: Cathy Gale (Honor Blackman), Emma Peel (Diana Rigg), and Tara King (Linda Thorson).  The series ran from 1961 until 1969, screening as one-hour episodes for its entire run.  The pilot episode, "Hot Snow", aired on 7 January 1961. 

Triathlon<====>31524<====>Triathlon  A triathlon is a multiple-stage competition involving the completion of three continuous and sequential endurance disciplines.While many variations of the sport exist, triathlon, in its most popular form, involves swimming, cycling, and running in immediate succession over various distances.  Triathletes compete for fastest overall course completion time, including timed "transitions" between the individual swim, cycle, and run components.   The word "triathlon" is of Greek origin from τρεῖς or treis ("three") and ἆθλος or athlos ("competition").  A transition area is set up where the athletes change gear for different segments of the race. 

Germs (band)<====>31525<====>Germs (band) The Germs were an American punk rock band from Los Angeles, California, United States, originally active from 1977 to 1980.  The band's main early lineup consisted of singer Darby Crash, guitarist Pat Smear, bassist Lorna Doom and drummer Don Bolles.  They released only one album, 1979's (GI), produced by Joan Jett, and were featured the following year in Penelope Spheeris' documentary film The Decline of Western Civilization, which chronicled the Los Angeles punk movement. The Germs disbanded following Crash's suicide on December 7, 1980.  Their music was influential to many later punk rock acts.  Smear went on to achieve greater fame performing with Nirvana and Foo Fighters. 

Thuggee<====>31526<====>Thuggee  Thuggee or tuggee ( ;  ; Nepali: ठग्गी ṭhaggī;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) refers to the acts of Thugs, an organised gang of professional robbers and murderers. Thugs travelled in groups across the Indian sub-continent for six hundred years.  "Tracing India's cult of Thugs".  3 August 2003.  Los Angeles Times.   Although the Thugs traced their origin to seven Muslim tribes, Hindus appear to have been associated with them at an early period.  The earliest authenticated mention of thugs appears in Ziyā-ud-Dīn Baranī's History of Fīrūz Shāh, dated around 1356. 

Tape-out<====>31527<====>Tape-outIn electronics design, Tapeout is the final result of the design process for integrated circuits or printed circuit boards before they are sent for manufacturing.  The Tapeout is specifically the point at which the graphic for the photomask of the circuit is sent to the fabrication facility.    Historically, the term references the early days of printed circuit design, when the enlarged (for higher precision) "artwork" for the photomask was manually "taped out" using black line tape (commonly Bishop Graphics crepe).   In the post-war era of the 1940-50s, the techniques developed for rapid and low-cost circuit reproduction evolved to photographically replicated 2D manufacturing.

Transuranium element<====>31537<====>Transuranium element The transuranium elements (also known as transuranic elements) are the chemical elements with atomic numbers greater than 92 (the atomic number of uranium).  All of these elements are unstable and decay radioactively into other elements. Overview Of the elements with atomic numbers 1 to 92, most can be found in nature, having stable (such as hydrogen), or very long half-life (such as uranium) isotopes, or are created as common products of the decay of uranium and thorium (such as radon).  The exceptions are elements 43, 61, 85, and 87; all four occur in nature, but only in very minor branches of the uranium and thorium decay chains, and thus all save element 87 were first discovered by synthesis in the laboratory rather than in nature (and even element 87 was discovered from purified samples of its parent, not directly from nature).

Twin cities<====>31542<====>Twin cities  Twin cities are a special case of two cities or urban centres that are founded in close geographic proximity and then grow into each other over time, losing most of their mutual buffer zone. There are no precise criteria for twin-cityhood, but to be considered twin cities, the cities involved have to have a similar administrative status and somewhat comparable sizes; a suburb of a much larger population center is usually not considered to form a twin city with it.  For example, South San Francisco (population about 65,000) is not considered a twin city with San Francisco (population about 850,000).

TRS-80 Color Computer<====>31562<====>TRS-80 Color Computer  The RadioShack TRS-80 Color Computer (also marketed as the Tandy Color Computer and affectionately nicknamed CoCo) is a line of home computers based on the Motorola 6809 processor.  The Color Computer was launched in 1980, and lasted through three generations of hardware until being discontinued in 1991. SummaryDespite bearing the TRS-80 name, the "Color Computer" is a radical departure from the earlier TRS-80; in particular it has a Motorola 6809E processor, rather than the TRS-80's Zilog Z80.  Thus, despite the similar name, the new machine is not compatible with software made for the old TRS-80.

Transient ischemic attack<====>31621<====>Transient ischemic attack A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a brief episode of neurological dysfunction caused by loss of blood flow (ischemia) in the brain, spinal cord, or retina, without tissue death (infarction).TIAs have the same underlying mechanism as ischemic strokes.  Both are caused by a disruption in blood flow to the brain, or cerebral blood flow (CBF).  The definition of TIA was classically based on duration of neurological symptoms.  The current widely-accepted definition is called "tissue-based" because it is based on imaging, not time.  The American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) now define TIA as a brief episode of neurological dysfunction with a vascular cause, with clinical symptoms typically lasting less than one hour, and without evidence of infarction on imaging. 

Transverse myelitis<====>31622<====>Transverse myelitis Transverse myelitis is a neurological condition in which the spinal cord is inflamed.  The inflammation damages nerve fibers, and causes them to lose their myelin coating leading to decreased electrical conductivity in the central nervous system.   Transverse implies that the inflammation extends across the entire width of the spinal cord.   Partial transverse myelitis and partial myelitis are terms used to define inflammation of the spinal cord that affects part of the width of the spinal cord.  Signs and symptomsThere are disturbances in sensory nerves and motor nerves and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system at the level of the lesion or below.

United States Constitution<====>31644<====>United States Constitution  The United States Constitution is the supreme law of the United States.   The Constitution, originally comprising seven articles, delineates the national frame of government.  Its first three articles entrench the doctrine of the separation of powers, whereby the federal government is divided into three branches: the legislative, consisting of the bicameral Congress; the executive, consisting of the President; and the judicial, consisting of the Supreme Court and other federal courts.  Articles Four, Five and Six entrench concepts of federalism, describing the rights and responsibilities of state governments and of the states in relationship to the federal government. 

Article One of the United States Constitution<====>31646<====>Article One of the United States Constitution   Article One of the United States Constitution establishes the legislative branch of the federal government, the United States Congress.   The Congress is a bicameral legislature consisting of a House of Representatives and a Senate.  Section 1: Legislative power vested in Congress  Section 1 is a vesting clause that bestows federal legislative power exclusively to Congress.  Similar clauses are found in Articles II and III.  The former confers executive power upon the President alone, and the latter grants judicial power solely to the federal judiciary.  These three articles create a separation of powers among the three branches of the federal government. 

Article Two of the United States Constitution<====>31647<====>Article Two of the United States Constitution Article Two of the United States Constitution establishes the executive branch of the federal government, which carries out and enforces federal laws.  The executive branch includes the President, the Vice President, the Cabinet, executive departments, independent agencies, and other boards, commissions, and committees.  Section 1: President and Vice President Clause 1: Executive Power Section 1 begins with a vesting clause that confers federal executive power upon the President.  Similar clauses are found in Article I and Article III.  The former bestows federal legislative power exclusively to Congress, and the latter grants judicial power solely to the Supreme Court. 

Article Three of the United States Constitution<====>31648<====>Article Three of the United States Constitution  Article Three of the United States Constitution establishes the judicial branch of the federal government.  The judicial branch comprises the Supreme Court of the United States and lower courts as created by Congress. Section 1: Federal courts Section 1 vests the judicial power of the United States in federal courts, requires a supreme court, allows inferior courts, requires good behavior tenure for judges, and prohibits decreasing the salaries of judges.  Number of courtsArticle III authorizes one Supreme Court, but does not set the number of justices that must be appointed to it. 

Article Four of the United States Constitution<====>31649<====>Article Four of the United States Constitution  Article Four of the United States Constitution outlines the relationship between each state and the others, and the several States and the federal government.  Section 1: Full faith and credit  The first section requires states to extend "full faith and credit" to the public acts, records and court proceedings of other states.  Congress may regulate the manner in which proof of such acts, records or proceedings may be admitted. In Mills v.  Duryee,  , the United States Supreme Court ruled that the merits of a case, as settled by courts of one state, must be recognized by the courts of other states; state courts may not reopen cases which have been conclusively decided by the courts of another state. 

Article Five of the United States Constitution<====>31650<====>Article Five of the United States Constitution  Article Five of the United States Constitution describes the process whereby the Constitution, the nation's frame of government, may be altered.  Altering the Constitution consists of proposing an amendment or amendments and subsequent ratification.  Amendments may be proposed either by the Congress with a two-thirds vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate or by a convention of states called for by two-thirds of the state legislatures.To become part of the Constitution, an amendment must be ratified by either—as determined by Congress—the legislatures of three-quarters of the states or state ratifying conventions in three-quarters of the states. 

Article Six of the United States Constitution<====>31651<====>Article Six of the United States Constitution   Article Six of the United States Constitution establishes the laws and treaties of the United States made in accordance with it as the supreme law of the land, forbids a religious test as a requirement for holding a governmental position and holds the United States under the Constitution responsible for debts incurred by the United States under the Articles of Confederation. Text  DebtsThe first clause of the Article provides that debts contracted prior to the adoption of the Constitution remain valid, as they were under the Articles of Confederation. Supremacy Clause two provides that the Constitution, federal laws made pursuant to it and treaties made under its authority, constitute the supreme law of the land. 

First Amendment to the United States Constitution<====>31653<====>First Amendment to the United States Constitution The First Amendment (Amendment I) to the United States Constitution prevents Congress from making any law respecting an establishment of religion, prohibiting the free exercise of religion, or abridging the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press, the right to peaceably assemble, or to petition for a governmental redress of grievances.  It was adopted on December 15, 1791, as one of the ten amendments that constitute the Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights was originally proposed to assuage Anti-Federalist opposition to Constitutional ratification.  Initially, the First Amendment applied only to laws enacted by the Congress, and many of its provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are today. 

Third Amendment to the United States Constitution<====>31654<====>Third Amendment to the United States Constitution  The Third Amendment (Amendment III) to the United States Constitution places restrictions on the quartering of soldiers in private homes without the owner's consent, forbidding the practice in peacetime.  The amendment is a response to Quartering Acts passed by the British parliament during the buildup to the American Revolutionary War, which had allowed the British Army to lodge soldiers in private residences. The Third Amendment was introduced in Congress in 1789 by James Madison as a part of the United States Bill of Rights, in response to Anti-Federalist objections to the new Constitution. 

Second Amendment to the United States Constitution<====>31655<====>Second Amendment to the United States Constitution    The Second Amendment (Amendment II) to the United States Constitution protects the right of the people to keep and bear arms and was adopted on December 15, 1791, as part of the first ten amendments contained in the Bill of Rights. The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that the right belongs to individuals,  while also ruling that the right is not unlimited and does not prohibit all regulation of either firearms or similar devices.   State and local governments are limited to the same extent as the federal government from infringing this right per the incorporation of the Bill of Rights. 

Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution<====>31656<====>Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution   The Fourth Amendment (Amendment IV) to the United States Constitution prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures.  It requires governmental searches and seizures to be conducted only upon issuance of a warrant, judicially sanctioned by probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.  It is part of the Bill of Rights and was adopted in response to the abuse of the writ of assistance, a type of general search warrant issued by the British government, and a major source of tension in pre-Revolutionary America. 

Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution<====>31658<====>Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution  The Sixth Amendment (Amendment VI) to the United States Constitution is the part of the United States Bill of Rights that sets forth rights related to criminal prosecutions.  The Supreme Court has applied the protections of this amendment to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. TextThe amendment as proposed by Congress in 1789 reads as follows:  Rights securedSpeedy trial Criminal defendants have the right to a speedy trial.  In Barker v.  Wingo,  , the Supreme Court laid down a four-part case-by-case balancing test for determining whether the defendant's speedy trial right has been violated. 

Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution<====>31659<====>Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution The Seventh Amendment (Amendment VII) to the United States Constitution is part of the Bill of Rights.  This amendment codifies the right to a jury trial in certain civil cases, and inhibits courts from overturning a jury's findings of fact. An early version of the Seventh Amendment was introduced in Congress in 1789 by James Madison, along with the other amendments, in response to Anti-Federalist objections to the new Constitution.  Congress proposed a revised version of the Seventh Amendment to the states on September 28, 1789, and by December 15, 1791, the necessary three-quarters of the states had ratified it. 

Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution<====>31660<====>Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution   The Eighth Amendment (Amendment VIII) of the United States Constitution prohibits the federal government from imposing excessive bail, excessive fines, or cruel and unusual punishment.  The U. S.  Supreme Court has ruled that this amendment's Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause also applies to the states.  The phrases in this amendment originated in the English Bill of Rights of 1689.  This amendment was adopted on December 15, 1791, along with the rest of the United States Bill of Rights.  Text  BackgroundThe Eighth Amendment was adopted, as part of the Bill of Rights, in 1791. 

Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution<====>31661<====>Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution The Ninth Amendment (Amendment IX) to the United States Constitution addresses rights, retained by the people, that are not specifically enumerated in the Constitution.  It is part of the Bill of Rights. TextThe amendment as proposed by Congress in 1789 reads as follows:  Background before adoptionWhen the U. S.  Constitution was put to the states for ratification after being signed on September 17, 1787, the Anti-Federalists argued that a Bill of Rights should be added.  One of the arguments the Federalists gave against the addition of a Bill of Rights, during the debates about ratification of the Constitution, was that a listing of rights could problematically enlarge the powers specified in Article One, Section 8 of the new Constitution by implication. 

Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution<====>31662<====>Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution The Tenth Amendment (Amendment X) to the United States Constitution, which is part of the Bill of Rights, was ratified on December 15, 1791.    It expresses the principle of federalism and states' rights, which strictly supports the entire plan of the original Constitution for the United States of America, by stating that the federal government possesses only those powers delegated to it by the United States  Constitution.   All remaining powers are reserved for the states or the people. The amendment was proposed by Congress in 1789 during its first term following the Constitutional Convention and ratification of the Constitution. 

Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution<====>31663<====>Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution The Eleventh Amendment (Amendment XI) to the United States Constitution, which was passed by Congress on March 4, 1794, and ratified by the states on February 7, 1795, deals with each state's sovereign immunity and was adopted to overrule the U. S.  Supreme Court's decision in Chisholm v.  Georgia,  .  Text Background The Eleventh Amendment was the first Constitutional amendment adopted after the Bill of Rights.  The amendment was adopted following the Supreme Court's ruling in Chisholm v.  Georgia,  .  In Chisholm, the Court ruled that federal courts had the authority to hear cases in law and equity brought by private citizens against states and that states did not enjoy sovereign immunity from suits made by citizens of other states in federal court. 

Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution<====>31664<====>Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution  The Twelfth Amendment (Amendment XII) to the United States Constitution provides the procedure for electing the President and Vice President.  It replaced the procedure provided in Article II, Section 1, Clause 3, by which the Electoral College originally functioned.  Problems with the original procedure arose in the elections of 1796 and 1800.  The Twelfth Amendment refined the process whereby a President and a Vice President are elected by the Electoral College.  The amendment was proposed by the Congress on December 9, 1803, and was ratified by the requisite three-fourths of state legislatures on June 15, 1804. 

Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution<====>31665<====>Thirteenth Amendment to the United States ConstitutionThe Thirteenth Amendment (Amendment XIII) to the United States Constitution abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime.  In Congress, it was passed by the Senate on April 8, 1864, and by the House on January 31, 1865.  The amendment was ratified by the required number of states on December 6, 1865.  On December 18, 1865, Secretary of State William H.  Seward proclaimed its adoption.  It was the first of the three Reconstruction Amendments adopted following the American Civil War. Since the American Revolution, states had divided into states that allowed and states that prohibited slavery. 

Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution<====>31666<====>Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution    The Fourteenth Amendment (Amendment XIV) to the United States Constitution was adopted on July 9, 1868, as one of the Reconstruction Amendments.  The amendment addresses citizenship rights and equal protection of the laws and was proposed in response to issues related to former slaves following the American Civil War.  The amendment was bitterly contested, particularly by the states of the defeated Confederacy, which were forced to ratify it in order to regain representation in Congress. The Fourteenth Amendment, particularly its first section, is one of the most litigated parts of the Constitution, forming the basis for landmark decisions such as Brown v. 

Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution<====>31667<====>Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution  The Fifteenth Amendment (Amendment XV) to the United States Constitution prohibits the federal and state governments from denying a citizen the right to vote based on that citizen's "race, color, or previous condition of servitude".  It was ratified on February 3, 1870, as the third and last of the Reconstruction Amendments.  In the final years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era that followed, Congress repeatedly debated the rights of the millions of black former slaves.  By 1869, amendments had been passed to abolish slavery and provide citizenship and equal protection under the laws, but the election of Ulysses S. 

Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution<====>31668<====>Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution   The Sixteenth Amendment (Amendment XVI) to the United States Constitution allows the Congress to levy an income tax without apportioning it among the states or basing it on the United States Census.  This amendment exempted income taxes from the constitutional requirements regarding direct taxes, after income taxes on rents, dividends, and interest were ruled to be direct taxes in the court case of Pollock v.  Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.  (1895).  The amendment was adopted on February 3, 1913. Text Other Constitutional provisions regarding taxesArticle I, Section 2, Clause 3: Article I, Section 8, Clause 1: Article I, Section 9, Clause 4: This clause basically refers to a tax on property, such as a tax based on the value of land, Hylton v. 

Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution<====>31669<====>Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution  The Seventeenth Amendment (Amendment XVII) to the United States Constitution established the popular election of United States Senators by the people of the states.  The amendment supersedes Article I, §3, Clauses 1 and 2 of the Constitution, under which senators were elected by state legislatures.  It also alters the procedure for filling vacancies in the Senate, allowing for state legislatures to permit their governors to make temporary appointments until a special election can be held. The amendment was proposed by the 62nd Congress in 1912 and adopted in 1913 upon being ratified by three-fourths (36) of the state legislatures. 

Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution<====>31670<====>Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution  The Nineteenth Amendment (Amendment XIX) to the United States Constitution prohibits the states and the federal government from denying the right to vote to citizens of the United States on the basis of sex.  It was adopted on August 18, 1920.  Until the 1910s, most states did not give women the right to vote.  The amendment was the culmination of the women's suffrage movement in the United States, which fought at both state and national levels to achieve the vote.  It effectively overruled Minor v.  Happersett, in which a unanimous Supreme Court ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment did not give women the right to vote. 

Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution<====>31671<====>Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution  The Eighteenth Amendment (Amendment XVIII) of the United States Constitution effectively established the prohibition of alcoholic beverages in the United States by declaring the production, transport, and sale of alcohol (though not the consumption or private possession) illegal.  The separate Volstead Act set down methods for enforcing the Eighteenth Amendment, and defined which "intoxicating liquors" were prohibited, and which were excluded from prohibition (e. g. , for medical and religious purposes).  The Amendment was the first to set a time delay before it would take effect following ratification, and the first to set a time limit for its ratification by the states. 

Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution<====>31672<====>Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution The Twentieth Amendment (Amendment XX) to the United States Constitution moved the beginning and ending of the terms of the president and vice president from March 4 to January 20, and of members of Congress from March 4 to January 3.  It also has provisions that determine what is to be done when there is no president-elect.  The Twentieth Amendment was adopted on January 23, 1933.  Text Historical backgroundArticle I, Section 4, Clause 2 of the Constitution states that Congress must meet at least once per year, on the first Monday in December, though Congress could by law set another date and the president could summon special sessions.

Uralic languages<====>31715<====>Uralic languages   The Uralic languages ( ; sometimes called Uralian languages  ) constitute a language family of 38  languages spoken by approximately 25 million people, predominantly in Northern Eurasia.  The Uralic languages with the most native speakers are Hungarian, Finnish, and Estonian, which are official languages of Hungary, Finland, and Estonia, respectively, and of the European Union.  Other Uralic languages with significant numbers of speakers are Erzya, Moksha, Mari, Udmurt, and Komi, which are officially recognized languages in various regions of Russia. The name "Uralic" derives from the fact that the areas where the languages are spoken are found on both sides of the Ural Mountains. 

Utah<====>31716<====>UtahUtah (  or  ) is a state in the western United States.  It became the 45th state admitted to the U. S.  on January 4, 1896.  Utah is the 13th-largest by area, 31st-most-populous, and 10th-least-densely populated of the 50 United States.  Utah has a population of more than 3 million (Census estimate for July 1, 2016), approximately 80% of whom live along the Wasatch Front, centering on the state capital Salt Lake City.   Utah is bordered by Colorado to the east, Wyoming to the northeast, Idaho to the north, Arizona to the south, and Nevada to the west. 

United Kingdom<====>31717<====>United Kingdom  The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country  in western Europe.  Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, the United Kingdom includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland and many smaller islands.   Northern Ireland is the only part of the United Kingdom that shares a land border with another sovereign state the Republic of Ireland.  Although Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign state, two of its Overseas Territories also share land borders with other sovereign countries.

History of the United Kingdom<====>31723<====>History of the United Kingdom The history of the United Kingdom as a unified sovereign state began in 1707 with the political union of the kingdoms of England and Scotland,  into a united kingdom called Great Britain.  The terms United Kingdom and United Kingdom of Great Britain were used in the Treaty of Union and the Act of Union 1707.  However, the actual name of the new state was Great Britain.  The name Great Britain (then spelled Great Brittaine) was first used by James VI/I in October 1604, who indicated that henceforth he and his successors would be viewed as Kings of Great Britain, not Kings of England and Scotland.

It is the 22nd-largest in the world.  Its overall population density is 259 people per square kilometre (671 people per sq mi), with England having a significantly higher population density than Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.   Almost one-third of the population lives in England's southeast, which is predominantly urban and suburban, with about 8 million in the capital city of London, the population density of which is just over 5,200 per square kilometre (13,468 per sq mi). 

Politics of the United Kingdom<====>31726<====>Politics of the United Kingdom    The United Kingdom is a unitary state with devolution, that is governed within the framework of a parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch, currently Queen Elizabeth II, is the head of state while the prime minister of the United Kingdom, currently Theresa May, is the head of government.  Executive power is exercised by the British government, on behalf of and by the consent of the monarch, as well as by the devolved governments of Scotland and Wales, and the Northern Ireland Executive.  Legislative power is vested in the two chambers of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the House of Commons and the House of Lords, as well as in the Scottish parliament and Welsh and Northern Ireland assemblies. 

Economy of the United Kingdom<====>31727<====>Economy of the United KingdomThe economy of the United Kingdom is highly developed and market-oriented.    It is the fifth-largest national economy in the world measured by nominal gross domestic product (GDP), ninth-largest measured by purchasing power parity (PPP), and nineteenth-largest measured by GDP per capita, comprising 3. 9% of world GDP.   It is the second-largest economy in the European Union by both metrics.  In 2016, the UK was the tenth-largest goods exporter in the world and the fifth-largest goods importer.  It also had the second-largest inward foreign direct investment,  and the third-largest outward foreign direct investment. 

Telecommunications in the United Kingdom<====>31728<====>Telecommunications in the United Kingdom   Telecommuncations in the United Kingdom have evolved from the early days of the telegraph to modern broadband and mobile phone networks with Internet services. HistoryNational Telephone Company (NTC) was a British telephone company from 1881 until 1911 which brought together smaller local companies in the early years of the telephone.  Under the Telephone Transfer Act 1911 it was taken over by the General Post Office (GPO) in 1912. Until 1982, the main civil telecommunications system in the UK was a state monopoly known (since reorganisation in 1969) as Post Office Telecommunications.  Broadcasting of radio and television was a duopoly of the BBC and Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA): these two organisations controlled all broadcast services, and directly owned and operated the broadcast transmitter sites. 

Transport in the United Kingdom<====>31729<====>Transport in the United Kingdom  Transport in the United Kingdom is facilitated with road, air, rail, and water networks.  A radial road network totals   of main roads,   of motorways and   of paved roads.  The National Rail network of 10,072 route miles (16,116 km) in Great Britain and 189 route miles (303 route km) in Northern Ireland carries over 18,000 passenger and 1,000 freight trains daily.  Urban rail networks exist in London, Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Cardiff, Belfast, Leeds and Liverpool.

British Armed Forces<====>31730<====>British Armed Forces   The British Armed Forces,  also known as Her Majesty's Armed Forces or the Armed Forces of the Crown, are the military services responsible for the defence of the United Kingdom, its overseas territories and the Crown dependencies.  They also promote Britain's wider interests, support international peacekeeping efforts and provide humanitarian aid.  Since the formation of a Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707 (later succeeded by the United Kingdom),  the armed forces have seen action in a number of major wars involving the world's great powers, including the Seven Years' War, the Napoleonic Wars, the Crimean War, the First World War, and the Second World War. 

Foreign relations of the United Kingdom<====>31731<====>Foreign relations of the United Kingdom   The diplomatic foreign relations of the United Kingdom are conducted by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, headed by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs.  The Prime Minister and numerous other agencies play a role in setting policy, and many institutions and businesses have a voice and a role. Britain was the world's foremost power during the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, most notably during the so-called "Pax Britannica" a period of totally unrivaled supremacy and unprecedented international peace during the mid-to-late 1800s.  The country continued to be widely considered a 'superpower' until the Suez crisis of 1956, and this embarrassing incident coupled with the loss of the empire left the UK's dominant role in global affairs to be gradually diminished. 

Urea<====>31734<====>Urea Urea, also known as carbamide, is an organic compound with chemical formula CO(NH 2 ) 2 .  This amide has two –NH 2  groups joined by a carbonyl (C=O) functional group. Urea serves an important role in the metabolism of nitrogen-containing compounds by animals and is the main nitrogen-containing substance in the urine of mammals.  It is a colorless, odorless solid, highly soluble in water, and practically non-toxic (  is 15 g/kg for rats).   Dissolved in water, it is neither acidic nor alkaline.   The body uses it in many processes, most notably nitrogen excretion. 

Uric acid<====>31736<====>Uric acid Uric acid is a heterocyclic compound of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen with the formula C 5 H 4 N 4 O 3 .  It forms ions and salts known as urates and acid urates, such as ammonium acid urate.  Uric acid is a product of the metabolic breakdown of purine nucleotides, and it is a normal component of urine.  High blood concentrations of uric acid can lead to gout and are associated with other medical conditions including diabetes and the formation of ammonium acid urate kidney stones. ChemistryUric acid is a diprotic acid with pK a1  = 5. 

Supreme Court of the United States<====>31737<====>Supreme Court of the United States    The Supreme Court of the United States is the highest federal court of the United States.  Established pursuant to Article Three of the United States Constitution in 1789, it has ultimate (and largely discretionary) appellate jurisdiction over all federal courts and state court cases involving issues of federal law plus original jurisdiction over a small range of cases.  In the legal system of the United States, the Supreme Court is generally the final interpreter of federal law including the United States Constitution, but it may act only within the context of a case in which it has jurisdiction.

University of Michigan<====>31740<====>University of Michigan   The University of Michigan (UM, U-M, U of M, or UMich), often simply referred to as Michigan,  is a public research university in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  Founded in 1817 in Detroit as the Catholepistemiad, or University of Michigania, 20 years before the Michigan Territory became a state, the University of Michigan is the state's oldest university.  In 1821, the university was officially renamed the University of Michigan.   It moved to Ann Arbor in 1837 onto   of what is now known as Central Campus.  Since its establishment in Ann Arbor, the university campus has expanded to include more than 584 major buildings with a combined area of more than   spread out over a Central Campus and North Campus, two regional campuses in Flint and Dearborn, and a Center in Detroit. 

Unemployment<====>31741<====>Unemployment  The unemployment rate is a measure of the prevalence of unemployment and it is calculated as a percentage by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by all individuals currently in the labor force.  During periods of recession, an economy usually experiences a relatively high unemployment rate.   According to International Labour Organization report, more than 200 million people globally or 6% of the world's workforce were without a job in 2012.  The causes of unemployment are heavily debated.   Classical economics, new classical economics, and the Austrian School of economics argued that market mechanisms are reliable means of resolving unemployment. 

Unicode<====>31742<====>Unicode  Unicode is a computing industry standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems.  The latest version contains a repertoire of 136,755 characters covering 139 modern and historic scripts, as well as multiple symbol sets.   The Unicode Standard is maintained in conjunction with ISO/IEC 10646, and both are code-for-code identical. The Unicode Standard consists of a set of code charts for visual reference, an encoding method and set of standard character encodings, a set of reference data files, and a number of related items, such as character properties, rules for normalization, decomposition, collation, rendering, and bidirectional display order (for the correct display of text containing both right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic and Hebrew, and left-to-right scripts). 

Uranium<====>31743<====>Uranium    Uranium is a chemical element with symbol U and atomic number 92.  It is a silvery-white metal in the actinide series of the periodic table.  A uranium atom has 92 protons and 92 electrons, of which 6 are valence electrons.  Uranium is weakly radioactive because all isotopes of uranium are unstable, with half-lives varying between 159,200 years and 4. 5 billion years.  The most common isotopes in natural uranium are uranium-238 (which has 146 neutrons and accounts for over 99%) and uranium-235 (which has 143 neutrons).  Uranium has the highest atomic weight of the primordially occurring elements. 

Ungulate<====>31744<====>Ungulate  Ungulates (pronounced  ) are any members of a diverse group of primarily large mammals that includes odd-toed ungulates such as horses and rhinoceroses, and even-toed ungulates such as cattle, pigs, giraffes, camels, deer, and hippopotamuses.  Most terrestrial ungulates use the tips of their toes, usually hoofed, to sustain their whole body weight while moving. The term means, roughly, "being hoofed" or "hoofed animal".  As a descriptive term, "ungulate" normally excludes cetaceans (whales, dolphins, porpoises), as they do not possess most of the typical morphological characteristics of ungulates, but recent discoveries indicate that they are descended from early artiodactyls. 

Udo of Aachen<====>31745<====>Udo of AachenUdo of Aachen (c. 1200–1270) is a fictional monk, a creation of British technical writer Ray Girvan, who introduced him in an April Fool's hoax article in 1999.  According to the article, Udo was an illustrator and theologian who discovered the Mandelbrot set some 700 years before Benoît Mandelbrot. Additional details of the hoax include the rediscovery of Udo's works by the also-fictional Bob Schipke, a Harvard mathematician, who supposedly saw a picture of the Mandelbrot set in an illumination for a 13th-century carol.  Girvan also attributed Udo as a mystic and poet whose poetry was set to music by Carl Orff with the haunting O Fortuna in Carmina Burana. 

Ultra<====>31748<====>Ultra   Ultra was the designation adopted by British military intelligence in June 1941 for wartime signals intelligence obtained by breaking high-level encrypted enemy radio and teleprinter communications at the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park.   Ultra eventually became the standard designation among the western Allies for all such intelligence.  The name arose because the intelligence thus obtained was considered more important than that designated by the highest British security classification then used (Most Secret) and so was regarded as being Ultra secret.   Several other cryptonyms had been used for such intelligence. 

Ukraine<====>31750<====>Ukraine  Ukraine (   ;    ), sometimes called the Ukraine,  is a sovereign state in Eastern Europe,  bordered by Russia to the east and northeast; Belarus to the northwest; Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia to the west; Romania and Moldova to the southwest; and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south and southeast, respectively.  Ukraine is currently in a territorial dispute with Russia over the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014  but which Ukraine and most of the international community recognise as Ukrainian. 

Ulysses S. Grant<====>31752<====>Ulysses S.  Grant   Ulysses S.  Grant (born Hiram Ulysses Grant,  April 27, 1822 – July 23, 1885) was a prominent United States Army general during the American Civil War and Commanding General at the conclusion of that war.  He was elected as the 18th President of the United States in 1868, serving from 1869 to 1877.  As Commanding General, Grant worked closely with President Abraham Lincoln to lead the Union Army to victory over the Confederacy.  After Lincoln's assassination, Grant's assignment in implementing Reconstruction often put him at odds with President Andrew Johnson, Lincoln's successor.

Urban legend<====>31771<====>Urban legend  An urban legend, urban myth, urban tale, or contemporary legend is a form of modern folklore.  It usually consists of fictional stories, often presented as true, with macabre or humorous elements, rooted in local popular culture.  These legends can be used for entertainment purposes, as well as semi-serious explanations for random events such as disappearances and strange objects. Urban legends are spread by any media, including newspapers, e-mail and social media.  Some urban legends have passed through the years with only minor changes to suit regional variations.  More recent legends tend to reflect modern circumstances, like the story of people ambushed and anesthetized, who awaken minus one kidney, which was supposedly surgically removed for transplantation. 

Ursa Major<====>31772<====>Ursa Major  Ursa Major ( ; also known as the Great Bear) is a constellation in the northern sky, whose associated mythology likely dates back into prehistory.   Its Latin name means "greater (or larger) she-bear", standing as a reference to and in direct contrast with nearby Ursa Minor, the lesser bear.   In antiquity, it was one of the original 48 constellations listed by Ptolemy (2nd century AD), and is now the third largest constellation of the 88 modern constellations.  Ursa Major is primarily known from the asterism of its main seven relatively bright stars comprising the "Big Dipper", "the Wagon", "Charles's Wain"  or "the Plough"  (among others), with its stellar configuration mimicking the shape of the "Little Dipper". 

Ursa Minor<====>31773<====>Ursa Minor    Ursa Minor (Latin: "Lesser Bear", contrasting with Ursa Major), also known as the Little Bear, is a constellation in the Northern Sky.  Like the Great Bear, the tail of the Little Bear may also be seen as the handle of a ladle, hence the North American name, Little Dipper: seven stars with four in its bowl like its partner the Big Dipper.  It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations.  Ursa Minor has traditionally been important for navigation, particularly by mariners, because of Polaris being the North Star. 

Ultimate (sport)<====>31775<====>Ultimate (sport)    Ultimate, originally known as ultimate frisbee, is a non-contact team sport played by players with a flying disc (frisbee).  Ultimate was developed in 1968 by a group of students at Columbia High School in Maplewood, New Jersey.  Although ultimate resembles many traditional sports in its athletic requirements, it is unlike most sports due to its focus on self-officiating, even at the highest levels of competition.   The term frisbee, often used to generically describe all flying discs, is a registered trademark of the Wham-O toy company, and thus the sport is not formally called "ultimate frisbee", though this name is still in common casual use.

Ultrasound<====>31780<====>Ultrasound   Ultrasound is sound waves with frequencies higher than the upper audible limit of human hearing.  Ultrasound is no different from 'normal' (audible) sound in its physical properties, except in that humans cannot hear it.  This limit varies from person to person and is approximately 20 kilohertz (20,000 hertz) in healthy, young adults.  Ultrasound devices operate with frequencies from 20 kHz up to several gigahertz. Ultrasound is used in many different fields.  Ultrasonic devices are used to detect objects and measure distances.  Ultrasound imaging or sonography is often used in medicine.  In the nondestructive testing of products and structures, ultrasound is used to detect invisible flaws.

The level of safety, quality and efficiency of passenger and freight transport, as well as the infrastructure's amount of energy usage, and the technological burden it places on the environment do not meet modern-day requirements. Due to the low level of demand, the country's existing transit potential and advantageous geographical position is not fully utilised. 

Foreign relations of Ukraine<====>31833<====>Foreign relations of Ukraine  Ukraine has formal relations with many nations and in recent decades has been establishing diplomatic relations with an expanding circle of nations.  The foreign relations of Ukraine are guided by a number of key priorities outlined in the foreign policy of Ukraine. Western relationsUkraine considers Euro-Atlantic integration its primary foreign policy objective, but in practice balances its relationship with Europe and the United States with strong ties to Russia.

Uterus<====>31863<====>Uterus   The uterus (from Latin "uterus", plural uteri) or womb is a major female hormone-responsive reproductive sex organ of humans and most other mammals.  In the human, the lower end of the uterus, the cervix, opens into the vagina, while the other end, the fundus, is connected to the fallopian tubes.  It is within the uterus that the fetus develops during gestation.  In the embryo, the uterus develops from the paramesonephric ducts which fuse into the single organ known as a simplex uterus.  The uterus has different forms in many other animals and in some it exists as two separate uteri known as a duplex uterus.

Universal Copyright Convention<====>31879<====>Universal Copyright Convention The Universal Copyright Convention (UCC), adopted in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1952, is one of the two principal international conventions protecting copyright; the other is the Berne Convention. The UCC was developed by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as an alternative to the Berne Convention for those states which disagreed with aspects of the Berne Convention, but still wished to participate in some form of multilateral copyright protection.  These states included developing countries as well as the United States and most of Latin America.  The former thought that the strong copyright protections granted by the Berne Convention overly benefited Western, developed, copyright-exporting nations, whereas the latter two were already members of the Buenos Aires Convention, a Pan-American copyright convention that was weaker than the Berne Convention. 

Universe<====>31880<====>UniverseThe Universe is all of space and time (spacetime) and its contents,  which includes planets, moons, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space and all matter and energy.    While the size of the entire Universe is still unknown,    it is possible to measure the observable universe. The earliest scientific models of the Universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric, placing Earth at the centre of the Universe. Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the centre of the Solar System. 

Uncertainty principle<====>31883<====>Uncertainty principle  In quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle, also known as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle or Heisenberg's indeterminacy principle, is any of a variety of mathematical inequalitiesasserting a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, known as complementary variables, such as position x and momentum p, can be known. Introduced first in 1927, by the German physicist Werner Heisenberg, it states that the more precisely the position of some particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa.   .

U-boat<====>31888<====>U-boat  U-boat is the anglicised version of the German word U-Boot  , a shortening of Unterseeboot, literally "undersea boat".   While the German term refers to any submarine, the English one (in common with several other languages) refers specifically to military submarines operated by Germany, particularly in the First and Second World Wars.  Although at times they were efficient fleet weapons against enemy naval warships, they were most effectively used in an economic warfare role (commerce raiding) and enforcing a naval blockade against enemy shipping.  The primary targets of the U-boat campaigns in both wars were the merchant convoys bringing supplies from Canada and other parts of the British Empire, and the United States to the United Kingdom and (during the Second World War) to the Soviet Union and the Allied territories in the Mediterranean.

It then entered into force on 21 March 1994, after a sufficient number of countries had ratified it.  The UNFCCC objective is to "stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system".The framework sets non binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions for individual countries and contains no enforcement mechanisms. 

Universal Declaration of Human Rights<====>31899<====>Universal Declaration of Human Rights    The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is a historic document that was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly at its third session on 10 December 1948 as Resolution 217 at the Palais de Chaillot in Paris, France.

Universalism<====>31902<====>Universalism  Universalism is a theological and philosophical concept that some ideas have universal application or applicability.   A community that calls itself universalist may emphasize the universal principles of most religions and accept other religions in an inclusive manner, believing in a universal reconciliation between humanity and the divine.   For example, some forms of Abrahamic religions claim the universal value of their doctrine and moral principles, and "feel inclusive"  .  Christian Universalism is focused around the idea of universal reconciliation, also known as universal salvation — the doctrine that every human soul will ultimately be reconciled to God because of divine love and mercy. 

Unitarian Universalist Association<====>31903<====>Unitarian Universalist Association  Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) is a liberal religious association of Unitarian Universalist congregations.  It was formed in 1961 by the consolidation of the American Unitarian Association and the Universalist Church of America.   Both of these predecessor organizations began as Christian denominations of the Unitarian and Universalist varieties respectively.  However, modern Unitarian Universalists see themselves as a separate religion with its own beliefs and affinities.  They define themselves as non-creedal, and draw wisdom from various religions and philosophies, including humanism, pantheism, Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Judaism, Islam, and Earth-centered spirituality.Thus, the UUA is a syncretistic religious group with liberal leanings.

Ultrafilter<====>31911<====>Ultrafilter In the mathematical field of set theory, an ultrafilter on a given partially ordered set (poset) P is a maximal filter on P, that is, a filter on P that cannot be enlarged.  Filters and ultrafilters are special subsets of P.  If P happens to be a Boolean algebra, each ultrafilter is also a prime filter, and vice versa.  If X is an arbitrary set, its power set ℘(X), ordered by set inclusion, is always a Boolean algebra, and (ultra)filters on ℘(X) are usually called "(ultra)filters on X".  If X happens to be partially ordered, too, particular care is needed to understand from the context whether an (ultra)filter on ℘(X) or an (ultra)filter just on X is meant; both kinds of (ultra)filters are quite different. 

Útgarðar<====>31914<====>ÚtgarðarIn Norse mythology, Útgarðar (literal meaning:  "Outyards"; plural of Útgarðr; the word can be anglicized to Utgard, Utgardar and in other ways) surrounded a stronghold of the Ettings.   They are associated with Útgarða-Loki, a great and devious giant featured in one of the myths concerning Thor and the other Loki who compete in rigged competitions held in the Outyards.   These outdoor arenas contrast with the putrid, indoor cave where Útgarða-Loki is said to dwell, when chained, in the Gesta Danorum.  In another version of Norse mythology, Utgard is thought to be the final of the three worlds connected to  Yggdrasil being the home of the external cosmic forces.

Universal property<====>32245<====>Universal property In various branches of mathematics, a useful construction is often viewed as the “most efficient solution” to a certain problem.   The definition of a universal property uses the language of category theory to make this notion precise and to study it abstractly. This article gives a general treatment of universal properties.  To understand the concept, it is useful to study several examples first, of which there are many: all free objects, direct product and direct sum, free group, free lattice, Grothendieck group, Dedekind–MacNeille completion, product topology, Stone–Čech compactification, tensor product, inverse limit and direct limit, kernel and cokernel, pullback, pushout and equalizer. 

Uncountable set<====>32248<====>Uncountable set In mathematics, an uncountable set (or uncountably infinite set)  is an infinite set that contains too many elements to be countable.

CharacterizationsThere are many equivalent characterizations of uncountability.   A set X is uncountable if and only if any of the following conditions holds:There is no injective function from X to the set of natural numbers. X is nonempty and for every ω-sequence of elements of X, there exist at least one element of X not included in it.

Universal Networking Language<====>32321<====>Universal Networking LanguageUniversal Networking Language (UNL) is a declarative formal language specifically designed to represent semantic data extracted from natural language texts.  It can be used as a pivot language in interlingual machine translation systems or as a knowledge representation language in information retrieval applications.  Scope and goalsUNL is designed to establish a simple foundation for representing the most central aspects of information and meaning in a machine- and human-language-independent form.  As a language-independent formalism, UNL aims to code, store, disseminate and retrieve information independently of the original language in which it was expressed.  In this sense, UNL seeks to provide tools for overcoming the language barrier in a systematic way. 

Urea breath test<====>32323<====>Urea breath test The urea breath test is a rapid diagnostic procedure used to identify infections by Helicobacter pylori, a spiral bacterium implicated in gastritis, gastric ulcer, and peptic ulcer disease.  It is based upon the ability of H.  pylori to convert urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide.  Urea breath tests are recommended in leading society guidelines as a preferred non-invasive choice for detecting H.  pylori  before and after treatment.   Principles and mechanismPatients swallow urea labelled with an uncommon isotope, either radioactive carbon-14 or non-radioactive carbon-13.  In the subsequent 10–30 minutes, the detection of isotope-labelled carbon dioxide in exhaled breath indicates that the urea was split; this indicates that urease (the enzyme that  H. 

United States naval reactors<====>32325<====>United States naval reactors    United States naval reactors are  nuclear reactors used by the United States Navy aboard certain ships to generate the steam used to produce power for propulsion, electric power, catapulting airplanes in aircraft carriers, and a few more minor uses.   Such Naval nuclear reactors have a complete power plant associated with them.  All U. S.  Navy submarines and supercarriers built since 1975 are nuclear-powered by such reactors.  There are no commissioned conventional (non-nuclear) submarines or aircraft carriers left in the U. S.  Navy, since the last conventional carrier,  , was decommissioned in May 2009.

UEFA<====>32332<====>UEFA    The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA,  ;  ;   ) is the administrative body for association football in Europe, although several member states are primarily or entirely located in Asia.  It is one of six continental confederations of world football's governing body FIFA.  UEFA consists of 55 national association members. UEFA represents the national football associations of Europe, runs nation and club competitions including the UEFA European Championship, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, and UEFA Super Cup, and controls the prize money, regulations, and media rights to those competitions. 

Coins of the United States dollar<====>32333<====>Coins of the United States dollarCoins of the United States dollar were first minted in 1792.  New coins have been produced annually since then and they make up a valuable aspect of the United States currency system.   Today, circulating coins exist in denominations of 1¢ (i. e.  1 cent or $0. 01), 5¢, 10¢, 25¢, 50¢, and $1. 00.   Also minted are bullion (including gold, silver and platinum) and commemorative coins.   All of these are produced by the United States Mint.   The coins are then sold to Federal Reserve Banks which in turn are responsible for putting coins into circulation and withdrawing them as demanded by the country's economy. 

Unified Team at the Olympics<====>32336<====>Unified Team at the Olympics   The Unified Team was the name used for the sports team of the former Soviet Union (except the Baltic states) at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville and the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.  The IOC country code was EUN, after the French name, Équipe unifiée.  The Unified Team was sometimes informally called the CIS Team (Commonwealth of Independent States, as a counterpart of CIS national football team taking part in Euro 1992 of the same year), although Georgia did not join the CIS until 1993. During the Winter Olympics, the National Olympic Committees (NOCs) of the constituent countries had not yet been affiliated to the IOC, so the Olympic Flag was used in place of a national flag at the Opening Ceremony and at medals ceremonies, and the Olympic Hymn was played for gold medallists. 

Uniform continuity<====>32337<====>Uniform continuityIn mathematics, a function f is uniformly continuous if, roughly speaking, it is possible to guarantee that f(x) and f(y) be as close to each other as we please by requiring only that x and y are sufficiently close to each other; unlike ordinary continuity, the maximum distance between f(x) and f(y) cannot depend on x and y themselves.  For instance, any isometry (distance-preserving map) between metric spaces is uniformly continuous. Every uniformly continuous function between metric spaces is continuous.  Uniform continuity, unlike continuity, relies on the ability to compare the sizes of neighbourhoods of distinct points of a given space. 

Uniform space<====>32339<====>Uniform space In the mathematical field of topology, a uniform space is a set with a uniform structure.  Uniform spaces are topological spaces with additional structure that is used to define uniform properties such as completeness, uniform continuity and uniform convergence. The conceptual difference between uniform and topological structures is that, in a uniform space, one can formalize certain notions of relative closeness and closeness of points.   In other words, ideas like "x is closer to a than y is to b" make sense in uniform spaces.   By comparison, in a general topological space, given sets A,B it is meaningful to say that a point x is arbitrarily close to A (i. 

Variance<====>32344<====>Variance In probability theory and statistics, variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its mean.   Informally, it measures how far a set of (random) numbers are spread out from their average value.  Variance has a central role in statistics, where some ideas that use it include descriptive statistics, statistical inference, hypothesis testing, goodness of fit, and Monte Carlo sampling.  Variance is an important tool in the sciences, where statistical analysis of data is common.  The variance is the square of the standard deviation, the second central moment of a distribution, and the covariance of the random variable with itself, and it is often represented by  \sigma^2 ,  s^2 , or  \operatorname{Var}(X) . 

Vacuole<====>32347<====>Vacuole A vacuole ( ) is a membrane-bound organelle which is present in all plant and fungal cells and some protist, animal  and bacterial cells.Vacuoles are essentially enclosed compartments which are filled with water containing inorganic and organic molecules including enzymes in solution, though in certain cases they may contain solids which have been engulfed.  Vacuoles are formed by the fusion of multiple membrane vesicles and are effectively just larger forms of these.   The organelle has no basic shape or size; its structure varies according to the needs of the cell. 

Verlan<====>32351<====>VerlanVerlan ( ) is an argot in the French language, featuring inversion of syllables in a word, and is common in slang and youth language.   It rests on a long French tradition of transposing syllables of individual words to create slang words. The name verlan is an example: it is derived from inverting the sounds of the syllables in l'envers ( , "the inverse", frequently used in the sense of "back-to-front"). General characteristics and structureWord formation Words in verlan are formed by switching the order in which syllables from the original word are pronounced. 

Virtual machine<====>32353<====>Virtual machine In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system.   Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer.  Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination. There are different kinds of virtual machines, each with different functions:System virtual machines (also termed full virtualization VMs) provide a substitute for a real machine.  They provide functionality needed to execute entire operating systems.  A hypervisor uses native execution to share and manage hardware, allowing for multiple environments which are isolated from one another, yet exist on the same physical machine. 

Virtual memory<====>32354<====>Virtual memory In computing, virtual memory (also virtual storage) is a memory management technique that provides an "idealized abstraction of the storage resources that are actually available on a given machine"  which "creates the illusion to users of a very large (main) memory. " The computer's operating system, using a combination of hardware and software, maps memory addresses used by a program, called virtual addresses, into physical addresses in computer memory.  Main storage, as seen by a process or task, appears as a contiguous address space or collection of contiguous segments.  The operating system manages virtual address spaces and the assignment of real memory to virtual memory. 

Vexatious litigation<====>32356<====>Vexatious litigationVexatious litigation is legal action which is brought, regardless of its merits, solely to harass or subdue an  .  It may take the form of a primary frivolous lawsuit or may be the repetitive, burdensome, and unwarranted filing of meritless motions in a matter which is otherwise a meritorious cause of action.  Filing vexatious litigation is considered an abuse of the judicial process and may result in sanctions against the offender. A single action, even a frivolous one, is usually not enough to raise a litigant to the level of being declared vexatious.  Rather, a pattern of frivolous legal actions is typically required to rise to the level of vexatious. 

Virgil<====>32359<====>Virgil   Publius Vergilius Maro ( ; traditional dates October 15, 70 BC – September 21, 19 BC ), usually called Virgil or Vergil   in English, was an ancient Roman poet of the Augustan period.  He wrote three of the most famous poems in Latin literature: the Eclogues (or Bucolics), the Georgics, and the epic Aeneid.  A number of minor poems, collected in the Appendix Vergiliana, are sometimes attributed to him.   Virgil is traditionally ranked as one of Rome's greatest poets.  His Aeneid has been considered the national epic of ancient Rome since the time of its composition. 

Value theory<====>32361<====>Value theory Value theory is a range of approaches to understanding how, why, and to what degree persons value things; whether the object or subject of valuing is a person, idea, object, or anything else. This investigation began in ancient philosophy, where it is called axiology or ethics.  Early philosophical investigations sought to understand good and evil and the concept of "the good".  Today, much of value theory aspires to the scientifically empirical, recording what people do value and attempting to understand why they value it in the context of psychology, sociology, and economics.  At the general level, there is a difference between moral and natural goods. 

Vampire<====>32362<====>Vampire    A vampire is a being from folklore that subsists by feeding on the life essence (generally in the form of blood) of the living.  In European folklore, vampires were undead beings that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive.  They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century. Vampiric entities have been recorded in most cultures; the term vampire, previously an arcane subject, was popularised in the West in the early 19th century, after an influx of vampire superstition into Western Europe from areas where vampire legends were frequent, such as the Balkans and Eastern Europe; Silver, A. 

Vostok 1<====>32363<====>Vostok 1  Vostok 1 ( , East or Orient 1) was the first spaceflight of the Vostok programme and the first manned spaceflight in history.  The Vostok 3KA space capsule was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome on April 12, 1961, with Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin aboard, making him the first human to cross into outer space. The orbital spaceflight consisted of a single orbit around Earth which skimmed the upper atmosphere at   at its lowest point.  The flight took 108 minutes from launch to landing.  Gagarin parachuted to the ground separately from his capsule after ejecting at   altitude. 

Vagueness<====>32369<====>VaguenessIn analytic philosophy and linguistics, a concept may be considered vague if its extension is deemed lacking in clarity, if there is uncertainty about which objects belong to the concept or which exhibit characteristics that have this predicate (so-called "border-line cases"), or if the Sorites paradox applies to the concept or predicate.  Williamson, T.  1994.  Vagueness,  .  London: Routledge.   The history of the problem of vagueness is traced, from the first Sorites Paradox to contemporary attempts to deal with higher-order vagueness such as many-valued logic, supervaluationism, and fuzzy logic.  Technicalities are kept to a minimum to favour a clear account, extremely useful to both students and researchers. 

Vector space<====>32370<====>Vector space A vector space (also called a linear space) is a collection of objects called vectors, which may be added together and multiplied ("scaled") by numbers, called scalars.  Scalars are often taken to be real numbers, but there are also vector spaces with scalar multiplication by complex numbers, rational numbers, or generally any field.  The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, called axioms, listed below. Euclidean vectors are an example of a vector space.   They represent physical quantities such as forces: any two forces (of the same type) can be added to yield a third, and the multiplication of a force vector by a real multiplier is another force vector.

Politics of Vietnam<====>32380<====>Politics of Vietnam  The politics of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam are defined by a single-party socialist republic framework, where the President of Vietnam is the head of state and the Prime Minister of Vietnam is the head of government, in a one-party system led by the Communist Party of Vietnam.  Executive power is exercised by the government and the President of Vietnam.  Legislative power is vested in the National Assembly of Vietnam ( ).  The Judiciary is independent of the executive.  The parliament adopted the current Constitution of Vietnam; its fifth, on 28 November 2013. 

Economy of Vietnam<====>32381<====>Economy of Vietnam The economy of Vietnam is the 47th-largest economy in the world measured by nominal gross domestic product (GDP) and 35th-largest in the world measured by purchasing power parity (PPP).  The country is a member of APEC, ASEAN and the WTO. Since the mid-1980s, through the Doi Moi reform period, Vietnam has made a shift from a highly centralized planned economy to a mixed economy that uses both directive and indicative planning through five-year plans.  Over that period, the economy has experienced rapid growth.  In the twenty-first century, Vietnam is in a period of being integrated into the global economy. 

People's Army of Vietnam<====>32384<====>People's Army of Vietnam    The People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN;  ), also known as the Vietnamese People's Army (VPA), is the military force of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.  The PAVN is a part of the Vietnam People's Armed Forces and includes: Ground Force (including Strategic Rear Forces), Navy, Air Force, Border Defence Force, and Coast Guard.  However, Vietnam does not have a separate Ground Force or Army branch.  All ground troops, army corps, military districts and specialised arms belong to the Ministry of Defence, directly under the command of the Central Military Commission, the Minister of Defence, and the General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army. 

Foreign relations of Vietnam<====>32385<====>Foreign relations of Vietnam As of September 2016, Vietnam (officially the Socialist Republic of Vietnam) maintains diplomatic relationships with 188 nations throughout the world,  including permanent members of United Nations Security Council.

Puzzle video game<====>32393<====>Puzzle video game   Puzzle video games make up a unique genre of video games that emphasize puzzle solving.  The types of puzzles can test many problem-solving skills including logic, pattern recognition, sequence solving, and word completion.  The player may have unlimited time or infinite attempts to solve a puzzle, or there may be a time limit, or simpler puzzles may be made difficult by having to complete them in real time, as in Tetris. The genre is very broad, but it generally involves some level of abstraction and may make use of colors, shapes, numbers, physics, or complex rules. 

Platform game<====>32394<====>Platform game  A platform game (or platformer) is a  type of video game, and subgenre of action game.  It involves guiding a player character or avatar to jump between suspended platforms and/or over obstacles to traverse their environment.  The player controls the jumps to avoid letting their character fall to their death or miss necessary jumps.  The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button, but now there are other alternatives like swiping a touchscreen.  Other acrobatic maneuvers may factor into the gameplay as well, such as climbing, swinging from vines or extendable arms, as in Ristar or Bionic Commando, or bouncing from springboards or trampolines, as in Alpha Waves. 

Fighting game<====>32398<====>Fighting gameA fighting game is a video game genre in which the player controls an on-screen character and engages in close combat with an opponent, which can be either an AI or controlled by another player.The fight matches typically consist of several rounds and take place in an arena, while each character has widely differing abilities but each is relatively viable to choose.  Players must master techniques such as blocking, counter-attacking, and chaining attacks together into "combos".  Since the early 1990s, most fighting games allow the player to execute special attacks by performing specific input combinations. 

Video game developer<====>32399<====>Video game developer A video game developer is a software developer that specializes in video game development – the process and related disciplines of creating video games.    A game developer can range from one person who undertakes all tasks  to a large business with employee responsibilities split between individual disciplines, such as programming, design, art, testing, etc.  Most game development companies have video game publisher financial and usually marketing support.   Self-funded developers are known as independent or indie developers and usually make indie games.    A developer may specialize in a certain video game console (such as Nintendo's Nintendo Switch, Microsoft's Xbox One, Sony's PlayStation 4), or may develop for a number of systems (including personal computers and mobile devices). 

History of video games<====>32401<====>History of video games    The history of video games goes as far back as the early 1950s, when academic computer scientists began designing simple games and simulations as part of their research.   Video gaming did not reach mainstream popularity until the 1970s and 1980s, when video arcade games and gaming consoles using joysticks, buttons, and other controllers, along with graphics on computer screens and home computer games were introduced to the general public.  Since the 1980s, video gaming has become a popular form of entertainment and a part of modern popular culture in most parts of the world. 

Vegetable farming<====>32405<====>Vegetable farming Vegetable farming is the growing of vegetables for human consumption.  The practice probably started in several parts of the world over ten thousand years ago, with families growing vegetables for their own consumption or to trade locally.  At first manual labour was used but in time livestock were domesticated and the ground could be turned by the plough.  More recently, mechanisation has revolutionised vegetable farming with nearly all processes being able to be performed by machine.  Specialist producers grow the particular crops that do well in their locality.  New methods such as aquaponics, Raised-bed gardening|raised beds and cultivation under glass are used. 

Virgo (constellation)<====>32407<====>Virgo (constellation) Virgo is one of the constellations of the zodiac.  Its name is Latin for virgin, and its symbol is ♍.  Lying between Leo to the west and Libra to the east, it is the second largest constellation in the sky (after Hydra).  It can be easily found through its brightest star, Spica.  LocationThe bright star Spica makes it easy to locate Virgo, as it can be found by following the curve of the Big Dipper/Plough to Arcturus in Boötes and continuing from there in the same curve ("follow the arc to Arcturus and speed on to Spica"). 

Vatican City<====>32408<====>Vatican City Vatican City ( ;    ;  ),  officially Vatican City State or State of Vatican City ( ;   ),  is a country located within the city of Rome.  With an area of 44 hectares (110 acres), and a population of about 1,000,    it is the smallest state in the world by both area and population.  However, formally it is not sovereign, with sovereignty being held by the Holy See. It is an ecclesiastical  or sacerdotal-monarchical    state (a type of theocracy) ruled by the Bishop of Rome – the Pope. 

Vehicle<====>32410<====>Vehicle  A vehicle (from) is a mobile machine that transports people or cargo.   Typical vehicles include wagons, bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships, boats), aircraft and spacecraft.  Halsey, William D.  (Editorial Director): MacMillan Contemporary Dictionary, page 1106.  MacMillan Publishing, 1979.    Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground: wheeled, tracked, railed or skied.  ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, for road vehicles types, terms and definitions. 

Vabis<====>32411<====>Vabis Vabis was the abbreviation and later also trademark of Swedish railway car manufacturer Vagnfabriks Aktiebolaget i Södertelge, which translates Wagon Factory Limited Company of Södertälje, established in 1891 in Södertälje.  Vabis also manufactured petrol engines, automobiles, trucks, motor-powered draisines, motorboats and marine engines.   The company was in 1911 merged with Maskinfabriks-aktiebolaget Scania, to form Scania-Vabis. HistoryThe company was established in December 1891 by steel manufacturer Surahammars Bruk and engineer and entrepreneur Philip Wersén,  in what was then known as Södertelge, Södermanland County.  Customers for the railway cars were the Swedish State Railways (SJ), Stockholms Spårvägar and other, private railway operators. 

Volvo<====>32412<====>Volvo   The Volvo Group ( ; legally Aktiebolaget Volvo, shortened to AB Volvo) (stylized as VOLVO) is a Swedish multinational manufacturing company headquartered in Gothenburg.  While its core activity is the production, distribution and sale of trucks, buses and construction equipment, Volvo also supplies marine and industrial drive systems and financial services.  In 2016, it was the world’s second largest manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks.  Although often conflated with the luxury vehicle manufacturer Volvo Cars, also based in Gothenburg, the two firms have been independent since AB Volvo sold Volvo Cars to Ford Motor Company in 1999.

Vänern<====>32415<====>Vänern Vänern ( ) is the largest lake in Sweden, the largest lake in the European Union and the third-largest lake entirely in Europe after Ladoga and Onega in Russia.  It is located in the provinces of Västergötland, Dalsland, and Värmland in the southwest of the country. HistoryGeologically, the lake was formed after the Quaternary glaciation about 10,000 years ago; when the ice melted, the entire width of Sweden was covered in water, creating a strait between Kattegat and the Gulf of Bothnia.  Due to the fact that ensuing post-glacial rebound surpassed concurrent sea-lelvel rise, lake Vännern became a part of the Ancylus Lake that occupied the Baltic basin. 

Valley<====>32416<====>Valley  A valley is a low area between hills or mountains often with a river running through it.  In geology, a valley or dale is a depression that is longer than it is wide.  The terms U-shaped and V-shaped are descriptive terms of geography to characterize the form of valleys.  Most valleys belong to one of these two main types or a mixture of them, (at least) with respect to the cross section of the slopes or hillsides.  Valley terminologyA valley in its broadest geographic sense is also known as a dale.  A valley through which a river runs may also be referred to as a vale. 

Geography of Vatican City<====>32419<====>Geography of Vatican City The geography of Vatican City is unique due to the country's position as an urban, landlocked enclave of Rome, Italy.  With an area of  , it is the world's smallest independent state.  Outside the Vatican City, thirteen buildings in Rome and Castel Gandolfo (the pope's summer residence) enjoy extraterritorial rights.  (One building, the Paul VI Audience Hall, straddles the border, but its Italian portion has extraterritorial rights. ) The country contains no major natural resources, and no known natural hazards other than those that affect Rome in general, such as earthquakes. Climate The city state has the same climate as Rome: temperate, mild, rainy winters (September to mid-May) with hot, dry summers (May to September). 

Politics of Vatican City<====>32421<====>Politics of Vatican City   The politics of Vatican City take place in a framework of an absolute theocratic elective monarchy, in which the head of the Catholic Church, the Pope, exercises ex officio supreme legislative, executive, and judicial power over the State of the Vatican City  (an entity distinct from the Holy See), a rare case of non-hereditary monarchy. The pope is elected in the Conclave, composed of all the cardinal electors (now limited to all the cardinals below the age of 80), after the death or resignation of the previous Pope.  The Conclave is held in the Sistine Chapel, where all the electors are locked in (Latin cum clave) until the election for which a two-thirds majority is required. 

Economy of Vatican City<====>32422<====>Economy of Vatican City    The unique, noncommercial economy of Vatican City is supported financially by contributions (known as Peter's Pence) from Roman Catholics throughout the world, the sale of postage stamps and tourist mementos, fees for admission to museums,  and the sale of publications.

Military in Vatican City<====>32425<====>Military in Vatican City  The Vatican City State is an enclave country which lies geographically entirely within Rome, the capital of Italy.  It was established in 1929 with the Lateran Treaty.  The responsibility for defending the state from an aggressor lies primarily with the Italian Armed Forces.  Since it was founded in 1929, the Vatican City State  has never been at war and has only seen anything close to military action when it was bombed during World War II. Historically, a number of other military units have existed on the territory of the Vatican City State  with ceremonial rather than military duties, including the Noble Guard and the Palatine Guard, both abolished by Pope Paul VI in 1970. 

Violin<====>32427<====>Violin    The violin, also known informally as a fiddle, is a wooden string instrument in the violin family.  Most violins have a hollow wooden body.  It is the smallest and highest-pitched instrument in the family in regular use.  Smaller violin-type instruments are known, including the violino piccolo and the kit violin, but these are virtually unused.  The violin typically has four strings tuned in perfect fifths, and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings, though it can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers (pizzicato) and by striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow (col legno). 

Vittorio De Sica<====>32428<====>Vittorio De Sica    Vittorio De Sica ( ; 7 July 1901 – 13 November 1974) was an Italian director and actor, a leading figure in the neorealist movement. Four of the films he directed won Academy Awards: Sciuscià and Bicycle Thieves were awarded honorary Oscars, while Ieri, oggi, domani and Il giardino dei Finzi Contini won the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar.  Indeed, the great critical success of Sciuscià (the first foreign film to be so recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences) and Bicycle Thieves helped establish the permanent Best Foreign Film Oscar. 

Vidkun Quisling<====>32429<====>Vidkun Quisling Vidkun Abraham Lauritz Jonssøn Quisling ( ; 18 July 1887 – 24 October 1945) was a Norwegian military officer and politician who nominally headed the government of Norway after the country was occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II. Quisling first came to international prominence as a close collaborator of explorer Fridtjof Nansen, organizing humanitarian relief during the Russian famine of 1921 in Povolzhye.  He was posted as a Norwegian diplomat to the Soviet Union, and for some time also managed British diplomatic affairs there.  He returned to Norway in 1929, and served as Minister of Defence in the governments of Peder Kolstad (1931–32) and Jens Hundseid (1932–33), representing the Farmers' Party. 

Vieille Montagne<====>32430<====>Vieille MontagneVieille Montagne is the name of a former zinc mine in Kelmis (La Calamine), a town in Belgium between Liège and Aachen.   The mine's name is French for "the old mountain", and this is also reflected in its German name, Altenberg (earlier, Alten Galmei-Berg).   The mine was once a bone of contention between Prussia on the one side and the United Kingdom of the Netherlands (later Belgium) on the other, that resulted in a piece of land that became the territory of Neutral Moresnet. HistoryAfter he developed an original refining process, Jean-Jacques Dony received a decree from the Napoleonic authorities in 1806 , allowing him to mine the zinc ore deposit at La Vieille Montagne near Liege. 

Vanadium<====>32431<====>Vanadium Vanadium is a chemical element with symbol V and atomic number 23.  It is a hard, silvery grey, ductile, and malleable transition metal.  The elemental metal is rarely found in nature, but once isolated artificially, the formation of an oxide layer (passivation) stabilizes the free metal somewhat against further oxidation. Andrés Manuel del Río discovered compounds of vanadium in 1801 in Mexico by analyzing a new lead-bearing mineral he called "brown lead", and presumed its qualities were due to the presence of a new element, which he named erythronium (derived from Greek for "red") since, upon heating, most of the salts turned red. 

Virginia<====>32432<====>Virginia  Virginia ( ; officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state in  the Southeastern  and Mid-Atlantic  regions of the United States located between the Atlantic Coast and the Appalachian Mountains.  Virginia is nicknamed the "Old Dominion" due to its status as the first English colonial possession established in mainland North America,    and "Mother of Presidents" because eight U. S.  presidents were born there, more than any other state.  The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna.

Veal<====>32434<====>VealVeal is the meat of   calves, in contrast to the beef from older cattle.  Veal can be produced from a calf of either sex and any breed; however, most veal comes from young males of dairy breeds  who are not used for breeding.   Generally, veal is more expensive than beef from older cattle. Some methods or aspects of veal production are controversial due to animal welfare concerns. TypesThere are several types of veal, although some terminology varies by country.   Types of veal include:Bob vealCalves are slaughtered when only a few weeks old (at most 1 month old) weighing up to 60 lb. 

Vellum<====>32435<====>Vellum  Vellum is prepared animal skin or "membrane" used as a material for writing on.  The term is derived from the Latin word vitulinum meaning "made from calf", leading to Old French velin for "calfskin".    Parchment is another term for this material category; if vellum is distinguished it is by vellum being made from calf skin, as opposed to that from other animals,    or otherwise being of higher quality.  Stokes and Almagno 2001, 114   Vellum is prepared as a surface for writing (or printing) to produce scrolls, single pages, codices or books. 

Vinyl group<====>32436<====>Vinyl groupIn chemistry, vinyl or ethenyl  is the functional group with the formula −CH=CH 2 .   It is the ethylene (IUPAC ethene) molecule (H 2 C=CH 2 ) less one hydrogen atom.   The name is also used for any compound containing that group, namely R−CH=CH 2  where R is any other group of atoms. An industrially important example is vinyl chloride, precursor to PVC, a plastic commonly known as vinyl.  Vinyl is one of the alkenyl functional groups.  On a carbon skeleton, sp 2 -hybridized carbons or positions are often called vinylic. 

V<====>32437<====>VV (named vee   ) is the 22nd letter in the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet. ==History== The letter V comes from the Semitic letter Waw, as do the modern letters F, U, W, and Y.   See F for details. In Greek, the letter upsilon 'Υ' was adapted from waw to represent, at first, the vowel   as in "moon".  This was later fronted to  , the front rounded vowel spelled 'ü' in German. In Latin, a stemless variant shape of the upsilon was borrowed in early times as V—either directly from the Western Greek alphabet or from the Etruscan alphabet as an intermediary—to represent the same   sound, as well as the consonantal  . 

Video<====>32441<====>Video    Video is an electronic medium for the recording, copying, playback, broadcasting, and display of moving visual media.  Video was first developed for mechanical television systems, which were quickly replaced by cathode ray tube (CRT) systems which were later replaced by flat panel displays of several types. Video systems vary in display resolution, aspect ratio, refresh rate, color capabilities and other qualities.  Analog and digital variants exist and can be carried on a variety of media, including radio broadcast, magnetic tape, optical discs, computer files, and network streaming. History Video technology was first developed for mechanical television systems, which were quickly replaced by cathode ray tube (CRT) television systems, but several new technologies for video display devices have since been invented. 

Vladimir Nabokov<====>32442<====>Vladimir Nabokov   Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov ( ;   ,  , also known by the pen name Vladimir Sirin;    2 July 1977) was a Russian-American novelist and entomologist.  His first nine novels were in Russian, but he achieved international prominence after he began writing English prose. Nabokov's Lolita (1955), his most noted novel in English, was ranked fourth in the list of the Modern Library 100 Best Novels;   Pale Fire (1962) was ranked 53rd on the same list, and his memoir, Speak, Memory (1951), was listed eighth on the publisher's list of the 20th century's greatest nonfiction.

Vagina<====>32476<====>Vagina    In mammals, the vagina is the fibromuscular, tubular part of the female genital tract extending, in humans, from the vulva to the cervix.  The outer vaginal opening is normally partly covered by a membrane called the hymen.  At the deep end, the cervix (neck of the uterus) bulges into the vagina.  The vagina allows for sexual intercourse and childbirth, and channels menstrual flow (menses), which occurs as part of the monthly menstrual cycle. The vagina's location and structure varies among species, and can vary in size.  Female mammals usually have two external openings in the vulva, the urethral opening for the urinary tract and the vaginal opening for the genital tract.

Vernor Vinge<====>32493<====>Vernor Vinge Vernor Steffen Vinge ( ; born October 2, 1944) is an American science fiction author and retired professor.  He taught mathematics and computer science at San Diego State University.  He is the originator of the technological singularity concept as the phrase is now used and perhaps the first to present a fictional "cyberspace".  He is best known for his Hugo Award-winning novels and novellas A Fire Upon the Deep (1992), A Deepness in the Sky (1999), Rainbows End (2006), Fast Times at Fairmont High (2002), and The Cookie Monster (2004), as well as for his 1984 novel The Peace War and his 1993 essay "The Coming Technological Singularity". 

Vi<====>32494<====>Vi    vi is a screen-oriented text editor originally created for the Unix operating system.  The portable subset of the behavior of vi and programs based on it, and the ex editor language supported within these programs, is described by (and thus standardized by) the Single Unix Specification and POSIX.  The original code for vi was written by Bill Joy in 1976, as the visual mode for a line editor called ex that Joy had written with Chuck Haley. Bill Joy's ex 1. 1 was released as part of the first BSD Unix release in March 1978. 

Vacuum tube<====>32496<====>Vacuum tube  In electronics, a vacuum tube, an electron tube,    or just a tube (North America), or valve (Britain and some other regions) is a device that controls electric current between electrodes in an evacuated container. Vacuum tubes mostly rely on thermionic emission of electrons from a hot filament or a cathode heated by the filament.  This type is called a thermionic tube or thermionic valve.  A phototube, however, achieves electron emission through the photoelectric effect.  Not all electronic circuit valves/electron tubes are vacuum tubes (evacuated); gas-filled tubes are similar devices containing a gas, typically at low pressure, which exploit phenomena related to electric discharge in gases, usually without a heater. 

Venice Film Festival<====>32497<====>Venice Film Festival  The Venice Film Festival or Venice International Film Festival ( , "International Exhibition of Cinematographic Art of the Venice Biennale"), founded in 1932, is the oldest film festival in the world and one of the "Big Three" film festivals alongside the Cannes Film Festival and Berlin International Film Festival.   The film festival is part of the Venice Biennale, which was founded by the Venetian City Council in 1895.  Today, the Biennale includes a range of separate events including: the International Art Exhibition; the International Festival of Contemporary Music; the International Theatre Festival; the International Architecture Exhibition; the International Festival of Contemporary Dance; the International Kids' Carnival; and the annual Venice Film Festival, which is arguably the best-known of all the events. 

Volume<====>32498<====>Volume Volume is the quantity of three-dimensional space enclosed by a closed surface, for example, the space that a substance (solid, liquid, gas, or plasma) or shape occupies or contains.Volume is often quantified numerically using the SI derived unit, the cubic metre.  The volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container; i.  e. , the amount of fluid (gas or liquid) that the container could hold, rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces. Three dimensional mathematical shapes are also assigned volumes.  Volumes of some simple shapes, such as regular, straight-edged, and circular shapes can be easily calculated using arithmetic formulas . 

Vector graphics<====>32499<====>Vector graphics  Vector graphics use 2D point located polygons to represent images in computer graphics.  Each of these points has a definite position on the x- and y-axes of the work plane and determines the direction of the path; further, each path may be assigned various attributes, including such values as stroke color, shape, curve, thickness, and fill.   Vector graphics are commonly found today in the SVG, EPS and PDF graphic file formats and are completely different than the more common raster graphics file formats of JPEG, PNG and MPEG4. OverviewOne of the first uses of vector graphic displays was the US SAGE air defense system. 

Vacuum pump<====>32500<====>Vacuum pump A vacuum pump is a device that removes gas molecules from a sealed volume in order to leave behind a partial vacuum.   The first vacuum pump was invented in 1650 by Otto von Guericke, and was preceded by the suction pump, which dates to antiquity. HistoryThe predecessor to the vacuum pump was the suction pump, which was known to the Romans.  Dual-action suction pumps were found in the city of Pompeii.   Arabic engineer Al-Jazari also described suction pumps in the 13th century.  He said that his model was a larger version of the siphons the Byzantines used to discharge the Greek fire. 

Vacuum<====>32502<====>Vacuum  Vacuum is space devoid of matter.  The word stems from the Latin adjective vacuus for "vacant" or "void".  An approximation to such vacuum is a region with a gaseous pressure much less than atmospheric pressure.  Physicists often discuss ideal test results that would occur in a perfect vacuum, which they sometimes simply call "vacuum" or free space, and use the term partial vacuum to refer to an actual imperfect vacuum as one might have in a laboratory or in space.  In engineering and applied physics on the other hand, vacuum refers to any space in which the pressure is lower than atmospheric pressure. 

Villa Savoye<====>32503<====>Villa Savoye Villa Savoye ( ) is a modernist villa in Poissy, on the outskirts of Paris, France.  It was designed by Swiss architects Le Corbusier and his cousin, Pierre Jeanneret, and built between 1928 and 1931 using reinforced concrete.   Courland, Robert.  Concrete Planet.  Prometheus Books, Amherst, NY.  (2012) page 326.  A manifesto of Le Corbusier's "five points" of new architecture, the villa is representative of the bases of modern architecture, and is one of the most easily recognizable and renowned examples of the International style. The house was originally built as a country retreat on behest of the Savoye family. 

Vapor<====>32505<====>Vapor In physics a vapor (American) or vapour  (British) is a substance in the gas phase at a temperature lower than its critical temperature, R.  H.  Petrucci, W.  S.  Harwood, and F.  G.  Herring, General Chemistry, Prentice-Hall, 8th ed.  2002, p.  483–86.   which means that the vapor can be condensed to a liquid by increasing the pressure on it without reducing the temperature.  A vapor is different from an aerosol.   An aerosol is a suspension of tiny particles of liquid, solid, or both within a gas. 

Vitamin C<====>32509<====>Vitamin C Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid and  L -ascorbic acid, is a vitamin found in food and used as a dietary supplement.   The disease scurvy is prevented and treated with vitamin C-containing foods or dietary supplements.   Evidence does not support use in the general population for the prevention of the common cold.   There is, however, some evidence that regular use may shorten the length of colds.It is unclear if supplementation affects the risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, or dementia. 

Vietnamese language<====>32511<====>Vietnamese language   Vietnamese   ( ) is a Viet–Muong language that originated in the north of modern-day Vietnam, where it is the national and official language.  It is the native language of the Vietnamese (Kinh) people, as well as a first or second language for the many ethnic minorities of Vietnam.  As the result of Vietnamese emigration and cultural influence, Vietnamese speakers are found throughout the world, notably in East and Southeast Asia, North America, Australia and Western Europe.  Vietnamese has also been officially recognized as a minority language in the Czech Republic. It is part of the Austroasiatic language family of which it has by far the most speakers (several times as many as the other Austroasiatic languages combined). 

Vitamin<====>32512<====>Vitamin   A vitamin is an organic compound and an essential nutrient that an organism requires in limited amounts.  An organic chemical compound (or related set of compounds) is called a vitamin when the organism cannot synthesize the compound in sufficient quantities, and it must be obtained through the diet; thus, the term vitamin is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular organism.  For example, ascorbic acid (one form of vitamin C) is a vitamin for humans, but not for most other animals.  Vitamin D is essential only for people who do not have adequate skin exposure to sunlight, as ultraviolet light promotes synthesis in skin cells. 

Viroid<====>32513<====>Viroid Viroids are the smallest infectious pathogens known.  They are solely composed of a short strand of circular, single-stranded RNA without protein coat.   All known viroids are inhabitants of higher plants, in which most cause diseases, some of which are of slight to catastrophic economic importance. The first recognized viroid, the pathogenic agent of the potato spindle tuber disease, was discovered, initially molecularly characterized, and named by Theodor Otto Diener, plant pathologist at the U. S Department of Agriculture's Research Center in Beltsville, Maryland, in 1971.   This viroid is now called Potato spindle tuber viroid, abbreviated PSTVd. 

Vladimir Vernadsky<====>32516<====>Vladimir Vernadsky  Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky ( ;  ;   – 6 January 1945) was a Russian, Ukrainian,    and Soviet mineralogist and geochemist who is considered one of the founders of geochemistry, biogeochemistry, and radiogeology, and was a founder of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences (now National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine).He is most noted for his 1926 book The Biosphere in which he inadvertently worked to popularize Eduard Suess’ 1885 term biosphere, by hypothesizing that life is the geological force that shapes the earth.  In 1943 he was awarded the Stalin Prize. 

VAX<====>32517<====>VAX  VAX  is a discontinued instruction set architecture (ISA) developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in the mid-1970s.  The VAX-11/780, introduced on October 25, 1977, was the first of a range of popular and influential computers implementing that architecture. A 32-bit system with a CISC architecture based on DEC's earlier PDP-11, VAX ("virtual address extension") was designed to extend or replace DEC's various PDP ISAs.  The VAX architecture's primary features were virtual addressing (for example demand paged virtual memory) and its orthogonal instruction set. VAX has been perceived as the quintessential CISC ISA, with its very large number of assembly-language-programmer-friendly addressing modes and machine instructions, highly orthogonal architecture, and instructions for complex operations such as queue insertion or deletion and polynomial evaluation. 

Valens<====>32519<====>Valens  Valens (328 – 9 August 378), fully Flavius Julius Valens Augustus ( ), was Eastern Roman Emperor from 364 to 378.  He was given the eastern half of the empire by his brother Valentinian I after the latter's accession to the throne.  Valens, sometimes known as the Last True Roman, was defeated and killed in the Battle of Adrianople, which marked the beginning of the collapse of the decaying Western Roman Empire. Life  Appointment as emperorValens and his brother Valentinian were both born in Cibalae (in present-day Croatia) into an Illyrian family in 328 and 321 respectively. 

Batavia (ship)<====>32524<====>Batavia (ship)    }   Batavia ( ) was a ship of the Dutch East India Company (VOC).  It was built in Amsterdam, Dutch Republic, in 1628, and armed with 24 cast-iron cannons and a number of bronze guns.  Batavia was shipwrecked on her maiden voyage, and was made famous by the subsequent mutiny and massacre that took place among the survivors.  A twentieth-century replica of the ship is also called the Batavia and can be visited in Lelystad, Netherlands. Mutiny on the BataviaDeparture and voyageOn 27 October 1628, the newly built Batavia, commissioned by the Dutch East India Company, sailed from Texel    for the Dutch East Indies, to obtain spices. 

Amsterdam (VOC ship)<====>32525<====>Amsterdam (VOC ship) }   The Amsterdam ( ) was an 18th-century cargo ship of the Dutch East India Company (Dutch: Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie; VOC).  The ship started its maiden voyage from Texel to Batavia on 8 January 1749, but was wrecked in a storm on the English Channel on 26 January 1749.  The shipwreck was discovered in 1969 in the bay of Bulverhythe, United Kingdom, and is sometimes visible during low tides.  The wreck site is protected under the Protection of Wrecks Act since 1974.  Some of the findings from the site are in The Shipwreck Museum in Hastings. 

Visual cortex<====>32528<====>Visual cortex  The visual cortex of the brain is a part of the cerebral cortex that processes visual information.  It is located in the occipital lobe in the back of the head. Visual information coming from the eye goes through the lateral geniculate nucleus in the thalamus and then reaches the visual cortex.  The part of the visual cortex that receives the sensory inputs from the thalamus is the primary visual cortex, also known as  visual area 1 (V1), and the striate cortex.  The extrastriate areas consist of visual areas 2 (V2), 3 (V3), 4 (V4), and 5 (V5). 

Velociraptor<====>32529<====>Velociraptor    Velociraptor ( ; meaning "swift seizer" in Latin)  is a genus of dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived approximately 75 to 71 million years ago during the later part of the Cretaceous Period.   Two species are currently recognized, although others have been assigned in the past.  The type species is V.  mongoliensis; fossils of this species have been discovered in Mongolia.  A second species, V.  osmolskae, was named in 2008 for skull material from Inner Mongolia, China. Smaller than other dromaeosaurids like Deinonychus and Achillobator, Velociraptor nevertheless shared many of the same anatomical features. 

Visigoths<====>32530<====>VisigothsThe Visigoths ( UK:   ;  US:   ;  ;  ) were the western branches of the nomadic tribes of Germanic peoples referred to collectively as the Goths.   These tribes flourished and spread throughout the late Roman Empire in Late Antiquity, or what is known as the Migration Period.  The Visigoths emerged from earlier Gothic groups (possibly the Thervingi) who had invaded the Roman Empire beginning in 376 and had defeated the Romans at the Battle of Adrianople in 378.   Relations between the Romans and the Visigoths were variable, alternately warring with one another and making treaties when convenient. 

Euclidean vector<====>32533<====>Euclidean vector In mathematics, physics, and engineering, a Euclidean vector (sometimes called a geometric  or spatial vector,  or—as here—simply a vector) is a geometric object that has magnitude (or length) and direction.  Vectors can be added to other vectors according to vector algebra.  A Euclidean vector is frequently represented by a line segment with a definite direction, or graphically as an arrow, connecting an initial point A with a terminal point B,  and denoted by  \overrightarrow{AB}.  A vector is what is needed to "carry" the point A to the point B; the Latin word vector means "carrier". 

Valhalla<====>32534<====>Valhalla In Norse mythology, Valhalla (from Old Norse Valhöll "hall of the slain" Orchard (1997:171–172).  ) is a majestic, enormous hall located in Asgard, ruled over by the god Odin.  Chosen by Odin, half of those who die in combat travel to Valhalla upon death, led by valkyries, while the other half go to the goddess Freyja's field Fólkvangr.  In Valhalla, the dead join the masses of those who have died in combat known as Einherjar and various legendary Germanic heroes and kings, as they prepare to aid Odin during the events of Ragnarök.  Before the hall stands the golden tree Glasir, and the hall's ceiling is thatched with golden shields. 

Viking Age<====>32538<====>Viking AgeThe Viking Age is the period from the late eighth century to the mid-11th century in European history, especially Northern European and Scandinavian history, following the Germanic Iron Age.   It is the period of history when Scandinavian Norsemen explored Europe by its seas and rivers for trade, raids, colonization, and conquest.  In this period, the Norsemen settled in Norse Greenland, Newfoundland, and present-day Faroe Islands, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Scotland, England, Ireland, the Netherlands, Germany, Ukraine, Russia, and Turkey. Viking travellers and colonists were seen at many points in history as brutal raiders. 

Vitamin K<====>32541<====>Vitamin K   Vitamin K is a group of structurally similar, fat-soluble vitamins the human body requires for complete synthesis of certain proteins that are prerequisites for blood coagulation (K from Koagulation, Danish for "coagulation") and which the body also needs for controlling binding of calcium in bones and other tissues.The vitamin K-related modification of the proteins allows them to bind calcium ions, which they cannot do otherwise.  Without vitamin K, blood coagulation is seriously impaired, and uncontrolled bleeding occurs.  Preliminary clinical research indicates that deficiency of vitamin K may weaken bones, potentially leading to osteoporosis, and may promote calcification of arteries and other soft tissues. 

Volvox<====>32543<====>Volvox Volvox is a polyphyletic genus of chlorophyte green algae in the family Volvocaceae.  It forms spherical colonies of up to 50,000 cells.  They live in a variety of freshwater habitats, and were first reported by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1700.  Volvox diverged from unicellular ancestors approximately  .    DescriptionVolvox is a polyphyletic genus in the volvocine green algae clade.Each mature Volvox colony is composed of up to thousands of cells from two differentiated cell types: numerous flagellate somatic cells and a smaller number of germ cells lacking in soma that are embedded in the surface of a hollow sphere or coenobium containing an extracellular matrix  made of glycoproteins. 

Vermouth<====>32544<====>Vermouth  Vermouth (   ; also  ;  ) is an aromatized, fortified wine flavored with various botanicals (roots, barks, flowers, seeds, herbs, and spices). The modern versions of the beverage were first produced in the mid to late 18th century in Turin, Italy.    While vermouth was traditionally used for medicinal purposes, its true claim to fame is as an aperitif, with fashionable cafes in Turin serving it to guests around the clock. However, in the late 19th century it became popular with bartenders as a key ingredient in many classic cocktails that have survived to date,   such as the Martini, the Manhattan, the Rob Roy, and the Negroni. 

Vinland<====>32545<====>Vinland Vinland, Vineland   or Winland    ( ) is the area of coastal North America  explored by Norse Vikings, where Leif Erikson first landed in c.  1000, approximately five centuries prior to the voyages of Christopher Columbus and John Cabot.  Vinland was the name given to North America as far as it was explored by the Vikings, presumably including both  Newfoundland and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence as far as northeastern New Brunswick (where the eponymous grapevines are found). In 1960, archaeological evidence of a Norse settlement  in North America (outside Greenland) was found at L'Anse aux Meadows on the northern tip of the island of Newfoundland. 

Vietnamese cuisine<====>32546<====>Vietnamese cuisine Vietnamese cuisine encompasses the foods and beverages of Vietnam, and features a combination of five fundamental tastes (Vietnamese: ngũ vị) in the overall meal.   Each Vietnamese dish has a distinctive flavor which reflects one or more of these elements.  Common ingredients include fish sauce, shrimp paste, soy sauce, rice, fresh herbs, fruit and vegetables.  Vietnamese recipes use lemongrass, ginger, mint, Vietnamese mint, long coriander, Saigon cinnamon, bird's eye chili, lime, and Thai basil leaves.   Traditional Vietnamese cooking is greatly admired for its fresh ingredients, minimal use of dairy and oil, complementary textures, and reliance on herbs and vegetables. 

Voltage<====>32549<====>Voltage    Voltage, electric potential difference, electric pressure  or electric tension (formally denoted   or  , but more often simply as V or U, for instance in the context of Ohm's or Kirchhoff's circuit laws) is the difference in electric potential between two points.  The voltage between two points is equal to the work done per unit of charge against a static electric field to move the test charge between two points.   This is measured in units of volts (a joule per coulomb). Voltage can be caused by static electric fields, by electric current through a magnetic field, by time-varying magnetic fields, or some combination of these three. 

Vincent Alsop<====>32550<====>Vincent AlsopVincent Alsop (c.  1630 – 8 May 1703) was an English Nonconformist clergyman, some of whose works became landmarks in the history of religious nonconformity. LifeAlsop came from Northamptonshire and was educated at St John's College, Cambridge.   He received deacon's orders from a bishop, and settled as assistant-master in the free school of Oakham, Rutland.  The Rev.  Benjamin King took him under his wing, and he married King's daughter.   He was thus converted to King's religious beliefs, and received ordination in the Presbyterian denomination, not being satisfied with that which he had from the bishop. 

Varuna<====>32551<====>Varuna  Varuna ( ;  IAST:    , Malay: Baruna) is a Vedic deity associated first with sky, later with waters as well as with Ṛta (justice) and Satya (truth). He is found in the oldest layer of Vedic literature of Hinduism, such as the hymn 7. 86 of the Rigveda.   He is possibly one of the earliest Indo-Aryan triads with parallels to an Avestan deity, possibly Iranian Ahura Mazda.    His streak of demonic violent tendencies, according to Hindu mythology, led to his demotion and Indra taking away most of his powers. 

Vladimir Markovnikov<====>32555<====>Vladimir Markovnikov Vladimir Vasilyevich Marcovnicov ( ), also spelled as Marcownicoff,  (December 22, 1838 – February 11, 1904), was a Russian chemist. Early life and educationMarcovnicov studied economics at the University of Kazan; during his studies, under the Russian cameral system, he also studied chemistry.  CareerAfter a conflict with that university, Marcovnicov was appointed professor at the University of Odessa in 1871 and,   two years later, at the University of Moscow, where he stayed the rest of his career. WorkMarcovnicov is best known for Marcovnicov's rule, elucidated in 1869 to describe addition reactions of H-X to alkenes. 

Valkyrie (magazine)<====>32556<====>Valkyrie (magazine) Valkyrie was a UK role-playing magazine.  The magazine was started in 1994.It was published by Partisan Press and edited originally by Dave Renton (original editor of Role Player Independent) and then taken over by Jay Forster.   Renton held the post from 1994 to 1998 and Forster from 1999 to 2003.  Some  claimed that it was the successor to White Dwarf amongst the UK role-playing community with numerous contributors from across the hobby, including Phil Masters and Marcus Rowland.   The magazine was resurrected as a quarterly with issue 19 and ran for several years before ceasing publication with issue 28. 

Vulture<====>32557<====>Vulture   A vulture is a scavenging bird of prey.   The two types of vultures are the New World vultures, including the Californian and Andean condors, and the Old World vultures, including the birds that are seen scavenging on carcasses of dead animals on African plains.  Some traditional Old World vultures (including the bearded vulture) are not closely related to the others, which is why the vultures are to be subdivided into three taxa rather than two.  New World vultures are found in North and South America; Old World vultures are found in Europe, Africa, and Asia, meaning that between the two groups, vultures are found on every continent except Australia and Antarctica. 

Volleyball<====>32558<====>VolleyballVolleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net.  Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules.   It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since 1964. The complete rules are extensive, but simply, play proceeds as follows: a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team's court. 

Vocative case<====>32559<====>Vocative case   The  vocative case (abbreviated  ) is the case used for a noun that identifies a person (animal, object etc. ) being addressed or occasionally the determiners of that noun.  A vocative expression is an expression of direct address by which the identity of the party spoken to is set forth expressly within a sentence.  For example, in the sentence "I don't know, John," John is a vocative expression that indicates the party being addressed, as opposed to the sentence "I don't know John" in which "John" is the direct object of the verb "know. 

Velodrome<====>32563<====>Velodrome  A velodrome is an arena for track cycling.  Modern velodromes feature steeply banked oval tracks, consisting of two 180-degree circular bends connected by two straights.  The straights transition to the circular turn through a moderate easement curve. HistoryThe first velodromes were constructed during the mid-late 19th century.  Some were purpose-built just for cycling, and others were built as part of facilities for other sports; many were built around athletics tracks or other grounds and any banking was shallow.  Reflecting the then-lack of international standards, sizes varied and not all were built as ovals: for example, the oldest velodrome in the UK, at Preston Park, Brighton (1877), is   long and features four straights linked by banked curves, while the   Portsmouth velodrome, in Portsmouth, has a single straight linked by one long curve. 

Sildenafil<====>32565<====>Sildenafil Sildenafil, sold as the brand name Viagra among others, is a medication used to treat erectile dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension.Its effectiveness for treating sexual dysfunction in women has not been demonstrated.   Common side effects include headaches and heartburn, as well as flushed skin.   Caution is advised in those who have cardiovascular disease.   Rare but serious side effects include prolonged erections, which can lead to damage to the penis, and sudden-onset hearing loss.   Sildenafil should not be taken by people who take nitrates such as nitroglycerin (glycerin trinitrate), as this may result in a severe and potentially fatal drop in blood pressure. 

Voltaic pile<====>32566<====>Voltaic pile The voltaic pile was the first electrical battery that could continuously provide an electric current to a circuit.  It was invented by Alessandro Volta, who published his experiments in 1799.  The voltaic pile then enabled a rapid series of other discoveries including the electrical decomposition (electrolysis) of water into oxygen and hydrogen by William Nicholson and Anthony Carlisle (1800) and the discovery or isolation of the chemical elements sodium (1807), potassium (1807), calcium (1808), boron (1808), barium (1808), strontium (1808), and magnesium (1808) by Humphry Davy.The entire 19th century electrical industry was powered by batteries related to Volta's (e. 

Volt<====>32567<====>Volt  The volt (symbol: V) is the derived unit for electric potential, electric potential difference (voltage), and electromotive force.   It is named after the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta (1745–1827). DefinitionOne volt is defined as the difference in electric potential between two points of a conducting wire when an electric current of one ampere dissipates one watt of power between those points.   It is also equal to the potential difference between two parallel, infinite planes spaced 1 meter apart that create an electric field of 1 newton per coulomb.  Additionally, it is the potential difference between two points that will impart one joule of energy per coulomb of charge that passes through it. 

Vela (constellation)<====>32568<====>Vela (constellation)  Vela is a constellation in the southern sky.  Its name is Latin for the sails of a ship, and it was originally part of a larger constellation, the ship Argo Navis, which was later divided into three parts, the others being Carina and Puppis.  With an apparent magnitude of 1. 8, its brightest star is the hot blue multiple star Gamma Velorum, one component of which is the brightest Wolf-Rayet star in the sky.  Delta and Kappa Velorum, together with Epsilon and Iota Carinae, form the asterism known as the False Cross.  1. 

Vitellius<====>32569<====>Vitellius  Vitellius ( ; Classical Latin spelling and reconstructed Classical Latin pronunciation:    24 September AD 15 – 22 December AD 69) was Roman Emperor for eight months, from 16 April to 22 December AD 69.  Vitellius was proclaimed emperor following the quick succession of the previous emperors Galba and Otho, in a year of civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors. Vitellius was the first to add the honorific cognomen Germanicus to his name instead of Caesar upon his accession; the latter name had fallen into disrepute in many quarters because of the actions of Nero. 

Vespasian<====>32570<====>Vespasian Vespasian ( ;   ; Classical Latin spelling and reconstructed Classical Latin pronunciation:     17 November AD 9 – 23 June AD 79 ) was Roman emperor from AD 69 to AD 79, the fourth, and last, in the Year of the Four Emperors.  He founded the Flavian dynasty that ruled the Empire for 27 years.  Vespasian was from an equestrian family that rose into the senatorial rank under the Julio–Claudian emperors.  Although he fulfilled the standard succession of public offices and held the consulship in AD 51, Vespasian's renown came from his military success; he was legate of Legio II Augusta during the Roman invasion of Britain in 43  and subjugated Judaea during the Jewish rebellion of 66. 

Volcano<====>32571<====>Volcano    A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface. Earth's volcanoes occur because its crust is broken into 17 major, rigid tectonic plates that float on a hotter, softer layer in its mantle.   Therefore, on Earth, volcanoes are generally found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging, and most are found underwater.  For example, a mid-oceanic ridge, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates whereas the Pacific Ring of Fire has volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates. 

Vesicle (biology and chemistry)<====>32572<====>Vesicle (biology and chemistry)In cell biology, a vesicle is a small structure within a cell, or extracellular, consisting of fluid enclosed by a lipid bilayer.  Vesicles form naturally during the processes of secretion (exocytosis), uptake (endocytosis) and transport of materials within the cytoplasm.  Alternatively, they may be prepared artificially, in which case they are called liposomes (not to be confused with lysosomes).  If there is only one phospholipid bilayer, they are called unilamellar liposome vesicles; otherwise they are called multilamellar.  The membrane enclosing the vesicle is also a lamellar phase, similar to that of the plasma membrane and vesicles can fuse with the plasma membrane to release their contents outside the cell. 

Victimology<====>32573<====>Victimology  Victimology is the study of victimization, including the psychological effects on victims, relationships between victims and offenders, the interactions between victims and the criminal justice system—that is, the police and courts, and corrections officials—and the connections between victims and other social groups and institutions, such as the media, businesses, and social movements.   Victimology is, however, not restricted to the study of victims of crime alone but may include other forms of human rights violations.   Victim of a crimeIn criminology and criminal law, a victim of a crime is an identifiable person who has been harmed individually and directly by the perpetrator, rather than by society as a whole. 

VESA Local Bus<====>32574<====>VESA Local Bus  The VESA Local Bus (usually abbreviated to VL-Bus or VLB) is a short-lived expansion bus that was mostly used in personal computers.  VESA (Video Electronics Standards Association) Local Bus worked alongside the ISA bus, acting as a high-speed conduit for memory-mapped I/O and DMA, while the ISA bus handled interrupts and port-mapped I/O. Historical overviewIn the early 1990s, the I/O bandwidth of the ISA bus was becoming a critical bottleneck to PC graphics performance.  The need for faster graphics was being driven by increasing adoption of graphical user interfaces in PC operating systems.  While IBM's attempt at producing a successor to ISA with the Micro Channel Architecture was a technically viable option, it failed in the market due to its proprietary nature and imposition of licensing fees. 

Vulgate<====>32576<====>Vulgate  The Vulgate ( ) is a late-4th-century Latin translation of the Bible that became the Catholic Church's officially  d Latin version of the Bible during the 16th century. The translation was largely the work of St Jerome, who in 382 had been commissioned by Pope Damasus I to revise the   ("Old Latin") Gospels then in use by the Roman Church.  Jerome, on his own initiative, extended this work of revision and translation to include most of the Books of the Bible, and once published, the new version was widely adopted and eventually eclipsed the  ; so that by the 13th century, it took over from the former version the appellation of " "  On the etymology of the noun (originally an adjective) vulgata  (the "version commonly used") or   for short, and in Greek as   ("Voulgata").

Viola<====>32600<====>Viola   The viola ( ;   ) is a string instrument that is bowed or played with varying techniques.  It is slightly larger than a violin and has a lower and deeper sound.  Since the 18th century it has been the middle or alto voice of the violin family, between the violin (which is tuned a perfect fifth above) and the cello (which is tuned an octave below).   The strings from low to high are typically tuned to C 3 , G 3 , D 4 , and A 4 . In the past, the viola varied in size and style as did its names. 

Vegetarian cuisine<====>32601<====>Vegetarian cuisine Vegetarian cuisine is based on food that meets vegetarian standards by not including meat and animal tissue products (such as gelatin or animal-derived rennet).  For lacto-ovo vegetarianism (the most common type of vegetarianism in the Western world), eggs and dairy products such as milk and cheese are permitted.  For lacto vegetarianism, the earliest known type of vegetarianism (recorded in India), dairy products such as milk and cheese are permitted.   The strictest forms of vegetarianism are veganism and fruitarianism, which exclude all animal products, including dairy, honey, and some refined sugars if filtered and whitened with bone char. 

Vincent van Gogh<====>32603<====>Vincent van Gogh    Vincent Willem van Gogh ( ;  30 March 1853 29 July 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art.  In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life.

Vocal loading<====>32609<====>Vocal loadingVocal loading is the stress inflicted on the speech organs when speaking for long periods.   BackgroundOf the working population, about 13% have professions where their voice is their primary tool.   That includes professions such as teachers, sales personnel, actors and singers, and TV and radio reporters.  Many of them, especially teachers, suffer from voice-related medical problems.  In a larger scope, this involves millions of sick-leave days every year, for example, both in the US and the European Union.  Still, research in vocal loading has often been treated as a minor subject. 

Vikings<====>32610<====>VikingsVikings (Old English: wicing—"pirate",  Danish and  ; Swedish and  ;  , from Old Norse) were Norse seafarers, mainly speaking the Old Norse language, who raided and traded from their Northern European homelands across wide areas of northern, central, eastern and western Europe, during the late 8th to late 11th centuries.   Roesdahl, pp.  9–22.   The term is also commonly extended in modern English and other vernaculars to the inhabitants of Viking home communities during what has become known as the Viking Age.  This period of Nordic military, mercantile and demographic expansion constitutes an important element in the early medieval history of Scandinavia, Estonia, the British Isles, France, Kievan Rus' and Sicily. 

Vietnam War<====>32611<====>Vietnam War   The Vietnam War ( ), also known as the Second Indochina War,  and also known in Vietnam as the Resistance War Against America ( ) or simply the American War, was a conflict that occurred in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia from 1 November 1955  to the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975.

Video art<====>32622<====>Video art Video art is an art form which relies on moving pictures in a visual and audio medium.  Video art came into existence during the late 1960s and early 1970s as new consumer video technology became available outside corporate broadcasting.  Video art can take many forms: recordings that are broadcast; installations viewed in galleries or museums; works streamed online, distributed as video tapes, or DVDs; and performances which may incorporate one or more television sets, video monitors, and projections, displaying ‘live’ or recorded images and sounds;.  Video art is named after the original analog video tape, which was most commonly used recording technology in the form's early years. 

Vanilla<====>32623<====>Vanilla  Vanilla is a flavoring derived from orchids of the genus Vanilla, primarily from the Mexican species, flat-leaved vanilla (V.  planifolia).  The word vanilla, derived from  , the diminutive of the Spanish word   (vaina itself meaning sheath or pod), is translated simply as "little pod".Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican people cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid, called tlilxochitl by the Aztecs.

Pollination is required to set the vanilla fruit from which the flavoring is derived. 

Video editing software<====>32624<====>Video editing software Video editing software is an application program which handles the post-production video editing of digital video sequences on a computer non-linear editing system (NLE).   It has replaced traditional flatbed celluloid film editing tools and analogue video tape-to-tape online editing  machines. NLE software is typically based on a timeline interface paradigm where sections of moving image video recordings, known as clips, are laid out in sequence and played back.  The NLE offers a range of tools for trimming, splicing, cutting and arranging clips across the timeline.  As digital NLE systems have advanced their toolset, their role has expanded and most consumer and professional NLE systems alike now include a host of features for colour manipulation, titling and visual effects, as well as tools for editing and mixing audio synchronized with the video image sequence. 

VisiCalc<====>32628<====>VisiCalc VisiCalc (for "visible calculator")  was the first spreadsheet computer program for personal computers, originally released for the Apple II by VisiCorp.  It is often considered the application that turned the microcomputer from a hobby for computer enthusiasts into a serious business tool, prompting IBM to introduce the IBM PC two years later.   VisiCalc is considered the Apple II's killer app.   It sold over 700,000 copies in six years, and as many as 1 million copies over its history. Initially developed in a 6502 assembler running on the Multics time sharing system,    VisiCalc was ported to numerous platforms, both 8-bit and some of the early 16-bit systems. 

Video game console<====>32629<====>Video game console  A video game console is an electronic, digital or computer device that outputs a video signal or visual image to display a video game that one or more people can play.

A home computer is a personal computer designed for home use for a variety of purposes, such as bookkeeping, accessing the Internet and playing video games. 

Veneration of the dead<====>32632<====>Veneration of the dead   The veneration of the dead, including one's ancestors, is based on love and respect for the deceased.  In some cultures, it is related to beliefs that the dead have a continued existence, and may possess the ability to influence the fortune of the living.  Some groups venerate their direct, familial ancestors; some faith communities, in particular the Catholic Church, venerate saints as intercessors with God, as well as praying for departed souls in Purgatory. In Europe, Asia, and Oceania, and in some African and Afro-Diasporic cultures, the goal of ancestor veneration is to ensure the ancestors' continued well-being and positive disposition towards the living, and sometimes to ask for special favours or assistance. 

Saint Veronica<====>32634<====>Saint Veronica  Saint Veronica was a pious woman of Jerusalem in the first century AD, according to Catholic tradition.A celebrated saint in many pious Christian countries, the Acta Sanctorum published by the Bollandists  gave her Feast (under July 12),  but the Jesuit Scholar Joseph Braun cited her commemoration in Festi Marianni on 13 January. According to Church tradition, Veronica was moved with pity when she saw Jesus carrying his cross to Golgotha and gave him her veil that he might wipe his forehead.  Jesus accepted the offering, held it to his face, and then handed it back to her—the image of his face miraculously impressed upon it.

Viz (comics)<====>32642<====>Viz (comics)   {{Infobox comic book title }}Viz is a popular British comic magazine founded in 1979 by Chris Donald.  It parodies British comics of the post-war period, notably The Beano and The Dandy, but with vulgar language, toilet humour, black comedy, surreal humour and generally sexual or violent storylines.  It also sends up tabloid newspapers, with mockeries of articles and letters pages.  It features parody competitions and advertisements for overpriced 'limited edition' tat, as well as obsessions with half-forgotten kitsch celebrities from the 1960s to the 1980s, such as Shakin' Stevens and Rodney Bewes.  Occasionally, it satirises current events and politicians, but has no particular political standpoint. 

Viol<====>32644<====>Viol   The viol  ,  viola da gamba   , or (informally) gamba, is any one of a family of bowed, fretted and stringed instruments with hollow wooden bodies and pegboxes where the tension on the strings can be increased or decreased to adjust the pitch of each of the strings.  Frets on the viol are usually made of gut, tied on the fingerboard around the instrument's neck, to enable the performer to stop the strings more cleanly.  Frets improve consistency of intonation and lend the stopped notes a tone which better matches the open strings. 

Voyeurism<====>32645<====>Voyeurism Voyeurism is the sexual interest in or practice of spying on people engaged in intimate behaviors, such as undressing, sexual activity, or other actions usually considered to be of a private nature.  The term comes from the French voir which means "to see".  A male voyeur is commonly labeled as "Peeping Tom" or a "Jags", a term which originates from the Lady Godiva legend.   However, that term is usually applied to a male who observes somebody secretly and, generally, not in a public place.  Medical issuesDefinition The American Psychiatric Association has classified certain voyeuristic fantasies, urges and behavior patterns as a paraphilia in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) if the person has acted on these urges, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.

Vaccine<====>32653<====>Vaccine    A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular disease.  A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins.  The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and to further recognize and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future.  Vaccines can be prophylactic (example: to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by a natural or "wild" pathogen), or therapeutic (e. 

Veterinary medicine<====>32654<====>Veterinary medicine Veterinary medicine is the branch of medicine that deals with the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease, disorder and injury in non-human animals.   The scope of veterinary medicine is wide, covering all animal species, both domesticated and wild, with a wide range of conditions which can affect different species. Veterinary medicine is widely practiced, both with and without professional supervision.   Professional care is most often led by a veterinary physician (also known as a vet, veterinary surgeon or veterinarian), but also by paraveterinary workers such as veterinary nurses or technicians.   This can be augmented by other paraprofessionals with specific specialisms such as animal physiotherapy or dentistry, and species relevant roles such as farriers. 

Visegrád Group<====>32658<====>Visegrád Group The Visegrád Group, Visegrád Four, or V4 is a cultural and political alliance of four Central European nations the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, that are members of the European Union (EU) for the purposes of advancing military, cultural, economic and energy cooperation with one another along with furthering their integration in the EU.    The Group traces its origins to the summit meetings of leaders from Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland held in the Hungarian castle-town of Visegrád  on 15 February 1991.  After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia became independent members of the group, thus increasing the number of members from three to four. 

Varney the Vampire<====>32659<====>Varney the Vampire  Varney the Vampire; or, the Feast of Blood is a Victorian era serialized gothic horror story variously attributed to James Malcolm Rymer and Thomas Peckett Prest.  It first appeared in 1845–1847 as a series of weekly cheap pamphlets of the kind then known as "penny dreadfuls".  The story was published in book form in 1847.  It is of epic length: the original edition ran to 876 double-columned pages   and 232 chapters.   Altogether it totals nearly 667,000 words.   Despite its inconsistencies, Varney the Vampire is more or less a cohesive whole. 

V12 engine<====>32660<====>V12 engine  A V12 engine is a V engine with 12 cylinders mounted on the crankcase in two banks of six cylinders each, usually but not always at a 60° angle to each other, with all 12 pistons driving a common crankshaft.   Since each cylinder bank is essentially a straight-six which is by itself in both primary and secondary balance, a V12 inherits perfect primary and secondary balance no matter which V angle is used, and therefore it needs no balance shafts.  A four-stroke 12 cylinder engine has an even firing order if cylinders fire every 60° of crankshaft rotation, so a V12 with cylinder banks at a multiples of 60° (60°, 120°, or 180°) will have even firing intervals without using split crankpins. 

V-twin engine<====>32661<====>V-twin engine  A V-twin engine, also called a V2 engine, is a two-cylinder internal combustion engine where the cylinders are arranged in a V configuration.   Although widely associated with motorcycles, V-twin engines are also produced for the power equipment industry and are often found in riding lawnmowers, small tractors and electric generators. HistoryGottlieb Daimler built a V-twin engine in 1889.  It was used as a stationary powerplant and to power boats. It was also used in Daimler's second automobile, the 1889 Stahlradwagen ("steel-wheeled car"). The engine was also manufactured under licence in France by Panhard et Levassor. 

Virial theorem<====>32664<====>Virial theoremIn mechanics, the virial theorem provides a general equation that relates the average over time of the total kinetic energy,  \left\langle T \right\rangle , of a stable system consisting of N particles, bound by potential forces, with that of the total potential energy,  \left\langle V_\text{TOT} \right\rangle , where angle brackets represent the average over time of the enclosed quantity.  Mathematically, the theorem states \left\langle T \right\rangle = -\frac{1}{2}\,\sum_{k=1}^N \left\langle \mathbf{F}_k \cdot \mathbf{r}_k \right\rangle where F k  represents the force on the kth particle, which is located at position r k .   The word virial for the right-hand side of the equation derives from vis, the Latin word for "force" or "energy", and was given its technical definition by Rudolf Clausius in 1870. 

Voice-over<====>32665<====>Voice-over   Voice-over (also known as off-camera or off-stage commentary) is a production technique where a voice—that is not part of the narrative (non-diegetic)—is used in a radio, television production, filmmaking, theatre, or other presentations.   The voice-over is read from a script and may be spoken by someone who appears elsewhere in the production or by a specialist voice talent.  Synchronous dialogue, where the voice-over is narrating the action that is taking place at the same time, remains the most common technique in voice-overs.  Asynchronous, however, is also used in cinema.It is usually pre-recorded and placed over the top of a film or video and commonly used in documentaries or news reports to explain information. 

Vincenzo Bellini<====>32668<====>Vincenzo Bellini  Vincenzo Salvatore Carmelo Francesco Bellini ( ; 3 November 1801 – 23 September 1835) was an Italian opera composer,  Lippmann and  McGuire 1998, in Sadie, p.  389  who was known for his long-flowing melodic lines for which he was named "the Swan of Catania".   Many years later, in 1898, Giuseppe Verdi "praised the broad curves of Bellini's melody: 'there are extremely long melodies as no-one else had ever made before'. " A large amount of what is known about Bellini's life and his activities comes from surviving letters—except for a short period—which were written over his lifetime to his friend Francesco Florimo, whom he had met as a fellow student in Naples and with whom he maintained a lifelong friendship. 

West African Vodun<====>32669<====>West African Vodun Vodun (meaning spirit in the Fon and Ewe languages,   with a nasal high-tone u; also spelled Vodon, Vodoun, Vodou, Voudou, Voodoo, etc. ) is practiced by the Ewe people of eastern and southern Ghana, and southern and central Togo; and the Kabye people, Gen-speaking people, and Fon people of southern and central Togo, and southern and central Benin.  It is also practiced by some Gun people of Lagos and Ogun in southwest Nigeria.  All the aforementioned peoples belong to Gbe-speaking ethnic groups of West Africa, except the Kabye. It is distinct from the various traditional African religions in the interiors of these countries and is the main source of religions with similar names found among the African diaspora in the Americas, such as Haitian Vodou; Dominican Vudú; Cuban Vodú; Brazilian Vodum; and Louisiana Voodoo. 

Vickers<====>32671<====>Vickers    Vickers was a famous name in British engineering that existed through many companies from 1828 until 1999. HistoryEarly historyVickers was formed in Sheffield as a steel foundry by the miller Edward Vickers and his father-in-law George Naylor in 1828.  Naylor was a partner in the foundry Naylor & Sanderson and Vickers' brother William owned a steel rolling operation.  Edward's investments in the railway industry allowed him to gain control of the company, based at Millsands and known as Naylor Vickers and Company.  It began life making steel castings and quickly became famous for casting church bells. 

Villard de Honnecourt<====>32673<====>Villard de HonnecourtVillard de Honnecourt (Wilars dehonecort, Vilars de Honecourt) was a 13th-century artist from Picardy in northern France.  He is known to history only through a surviving portfolio or "sketchbook" containing about 250 drawings and designs of a wide variety of subjects. LifeNothing is known of Villard apart from what can be gleaned from his surviving "sketchbook. " Based on the large number of architectural designs in the portfolio, it was traditionally thought that Villard was a successful, professional, itinerant architect and engineer.   This view is largely rejected today, as there is no evidence of him ever working as an architect or in any other identifiable profession, and the drawings contain many inaccuracies and misunderstandings that would be surprising from a practicing architect. 

Vertical interval timecode<====>32674<====>Vertical interval timecode Vertical Interval Timecode (VITC, pronounced "vitsee") is a form of SMPTE timecode encoded on one scan line in a video signal.   These lines are typically inserted into the vertical blanking interval of the video signal. With one exception, VITC contains the same payload as SMPTE linear timecode (LTC), embedded in a new frame structure with extra synchronization bits and an error-detection checksum.   The exception is that VITC is encoded twice per interlaced video frame, once in each field, and one additional bit (the "field flag") is used to distinguish the two fields. A video frame may contain more than one VITC code if necessary, recorded on different lines. 

Vandalism<====>32676<====>Vandalism   Vandalism is "action involving deliberate destruction of or damage to public or private property. " The term includes property damage, such as graffiti and defacement directed towards any property without permission of the owner.  The term finds its roots in an Enlightenment view that the Germanic Vandals were a uniquely destructive people. EtymologyThe Vandals, an ancient Germanic people, are associated with senseless destruction as a result of their sack of Rome under King Genseric in 455.  During the Enlightenment, Rome was idealized, while the Goths and Vandals were blamed for its destruction.  The Vandals may not have been any more destructive than other invaders of ancient times, but they did inspire British poet John Dryden to write, Till Goths, and Vandals, a rude Northern race, Did all the matchless Monuments deface (1694). 

Vocoder<====>32678<====>Vocoder A vocoder ( , a portmanteau of voice encoder) is a category of voice codec that analyzes and synthesizes the human voice signal for audio data compression, multiplexing, voice encryption, voice transformation, etc. The earliest type of vocoder, the channel vocoder, was originally developed as a speech coder for telecommunications applications in the 1930s, the idea being to code speech in order to reduce bandwidth (i. e.  audio data compression) for multiplexing transmission.  In the channel vocoder algorithm, among the two components of an analytic signal, considering only the amplitude component and simply ignoring the phase component tends to result in an unclear voice; on methods for rectifying this, see phase vocoder.

Vilfredo Pareto<====>32680<====>Vilfredo Pareto  Vilfredo Federico Damaso Pareto ( ; born Wilfried Fritz Pareto, 15 July 1848 – 19 August 1923) was an Italian engineer, sociologist, economist, political scientist, and philosopher, now also known for the 80/20 rule, named after him as the Pareto principle.  He made several important contributions to economics, particularly in the study of income distribution and in the analysis of individuals' choices.   He was also responsible for popularising the use of the term "elite" in social analysis. He introduced the concept of Pareto efficiency and helped develop the field of microeconomics.  He was also the first to discover that income follows a Pareto distribution, which is a power law probability distribution. 

Voice analysis<====>32681<====>Voice analysis Voice analysis is the study of speech sounds for purposes other than linguistic content, such as in speech recognition.  Such studies include mostly medical analysis of the voice  (phoniatrics), but also speaker identification.   More controversially, some believe that the truthfulness or emotional state of speakers can be determined using Voice Stress Analysis or Layered Voice Analysis. Typical voice problemsA medical study of the voice can be, for instance, analysis of the voice of patients who have had a polyp removed from their vocal cords through an operation.  Objective evaluation of voice quality improvement requires some way to measure of voice quality. 

VSE (operating system)<====>32682<====>VSE (operating system)   z/VSE (Virtual Storage Extended) is an operating system for IBM mainframe computers, the latest one in the DOS/360 lineage, which originated in 1965.  It is less common than prominent z/OS and is mostly used on smaller machines.  Primary z/VSE development occurs in IBM's Böblingen labs in Germany. OverviewDOS/360 originally supported 24-bit addressing.  As the underlying hardware evolved, VSE/ESA acquired support for 31-bit addressing.  IBM released z/VSE Version 4 in 2007.  z/VSE Version 4 requires 64-bit z/Architecture hardware and supports 64-bit real mode addressing.  With z/VSE 5. 1 (available since 2011) z/VSE introduced 64 bit virtual addressing and memory objects (chunks of virtual storage), that are allocated above 2 GB. 

Villanelle<====>32683<====>Villanelle A villanelle (also known as villanesque) Kastner 1903 p.  279  is a nineteen-line poetic form consisting of five tercets followed by a quatrain.  There are two refrains and two repeating rhymes, with the first and third line of the first tercet repeated alternately until the last stanza, which includes both repeated lines.  The villanelle is an example of a fixed verse form.  The word derives from Latin, then Italian, and is related to the initial subject of the form being the pastoral. The form started as a simple ballad-like song with no fixed form; this fixed quality would only come much later, from the poem "Villanelle (J'ay perdu ma Tourterelle)" (1606) by Jean Passerat. 

Victor Borge<====>32685<====>Victor Borge  Børge Rosenbaum (3 January 1909 – 23 December 2000),    known professionally as Victor Borge (   ), was a Danish and American comedian, conductor, and pianist who achieved great popularity in radio and television in the United States and Europe.  His blend of music and comedy earned him the nicknames "The Clown Prince of Denmark,"  "The Unmelancholy Dane,"  and "The Great Dane. " BiographyEarly life and careerRosenbaum was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, into a Jewish family.  His parents, Bernhard and Frederikke (Lichtinger) Rosenbaum, were both musicians: his father a violist in the Royal Danish Orchestra,   and his mother a pianist. 

Vulvovaginal health<====>32687<====>Vulvovaginal health Vulvovaginal health is the health and sanitation of the human vulva and vagina. Problems affecting this area include vulva diseases, vaginal diseases and urinary tract infections. Maintaining health The following measures are advisable for keeping the vulva and vagina healthy:Avoiding washing with soap, since soap disturbs the natural pH balance of the vagina.  Some pH-balanced soaps exist, but their effects remain unclear.  Other measures are seldom necessary or advisable.  Two notable examples: so-called "feminine hygiene sprays" are unnecessary, may be generally harmful, and have been known to cause severe allergic reactions.  Vaginal douching is generally not necessary and has been implicated in helping to cause bacterial vaginosis (BV) and candidiasis ("yeast infections"). 

Vulvodynia<====>32688<====>Vulvodynia Vulvodynia is a chronic pain syndrome that affects the vulvar area and occurs without an identifiable cause.   Symptoms typically include a feeling of burning or irritation.For the diagnosis to be made symptoms must last at least 3 months.   The exact cause is unknown but is believed to involve a number of factors, including genetics, immunology, and possibly diet.    Diagnosis is by ruling out other possible causes.    This may or may not include a biopsy of the area.    Treatment may involve a number of different measures; however, none is universally effective, and the evidence to support their effectiveness is often poor. 

Victor Meldrew<====>32689<====>Victor Meldrew Victor Meldrew is a fictional character in the BBC One sitcom One Foot in the Grave, created by David Renwick and portrayed by Richard Wilson.  The character epitomised the archetypal grumpy old man.  Meldrew is a foil for the bothersome aspects of children, cars, animals, power cuts and next-door neighbours (his particular example being Patrick Trench, played by Angus Deayton).  Meldrew is seen as misanthropic by the many victims of his wrath and misfortune, but he is also depicted as an honest, likeable and sympathetic character who is admired for having the guts to stand up and say something about an exasperating situation. 

Vratislaus I, Duke of Bohemia<====>32690<====>Vratislaus I, Duke of Bohemia Vratislaus (or Wratislaus) I ( ;   – 13 February 921), a member of the Přemyslid dynasty, was Duke of Bohemia from 915 until his death. LifeHe was a son of Duke Bořivoj I of Bohemia by his wife Ludmila and the younger brother of Duke Spytihněv I.  Around 906, he married Drahomíra, a Hevellian princess, to establish close ties with the Polabian Slavs.  Vratislaus had at least two sons, Wenceslaus and Boleslaus, both of whom succeeded him as Bohemian dukes.  Some historians believe that Střezislava, the wife of the Bohemian nobleman Slavník, founder of the Slavník dynasty, was also the daughter of Vratislaus. 

Víðarr<====>32692<====>VíðarrIn Norse mythology, Víðarr (Old Norse, possibly "wide ruler", Orchard (1997:174—175).   sometimes anglicized as Vidar, Vithar, Vidarr, and Vitharr) is a god among the Æsir associated with vengeance.  Víðarr is described as the son of Odin and the jötunn Gríðr, and is foretold to avenge his father's death by killing the wolf Fenrir at Ragnarök, a conflict which he is described as surviving.  Víðarr is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and is interpreted as depicted with Fenrir on the Gosforth Cross. 

Vowel<====>32693<====>Vowel    Vowels form one of the two principal classes of speech sound, the other being that of consonants.  Vowels vary in quality, in loudness and also in quantity (length).  They are usually voiced, and are closely involved in prosodic variation such as tone, intonation and stress.  Vowel sounds are produced with an open vocal tract.  The word vowel comes from the Latin word vocalis, meaning "vocal" (i. e.  relating to the voice).In English, the word vowel is commonly used to refer both to vowel sounds and to the written symbols that represent them. 

V6 engine<====>32695<====>V6 engine  A V6 engine is a V engine with six cylinders mounted on the crankshaft in two banks of three cylinders, usually set at either a 60 or 90 degree angle to each other.  The V6 is one of the most compact engine configurations, usually ranging from 2. 0 L to 4. 3 L displacement (however, much larger examples have been produced for use in trucks), shorter than the inline 4 and more compact than the V8 engine.  Because of its short length, the V6 fits well in the widely used transverse engine front-wheel drive layout. 

Vehmic court<====>32696<====>Vehmic courtThe Vehmic courts, Vehmgericht, holy vehme, or simply Vehm, also spelt Feme, Vehmegericht, Fehmgericht,  are names given to a "proto-vigilante" tribunal system of Westphalia in Germany active during the later Middle Ages, based on a fraternal organisation of lay judges called  “free judges” (  or  ).  The original seat of the courts was in Dortmund.  Proceedings were sometimes secret, leading to the alternative titles of “secret courts” ( ), “silent courts” ( ), or “forbidden courts” ( ).  After the execution of a death sentence, the corpse could be hung on a tree to advertise the fact and deter others. 

Violette Szabo<====>32697<====>Violette Szabo   Violette Reine Elizabeth Szabo GC (née Bushell; 26 June 1921 –   February 1945) was a Special Operations Executive (SOE) agent during the Second World War and a posthumous recipient of the George Cross.

Visual flight rules<====>32698<====>Visual flight rules Visual flight rules (VFR) are a set of regulations under which a pilot operates an aircraft in weather conditions generally clear enough to allow the pilot to see where the aircraft is going.  Specifically, the weather must be better than basic VFR weather minima, i. e.  in visual meteorological conditions (VMC), as specified in the rules of the relevant aviation authority.  The pilot must be able to operate the aircraft with visual reference to the ground, and by visually avoiding obstructions and other aircraft.  If the weather is below VMC, pilots are required to use instrument flight rules, and operation of the aircraft will primarily be through referencing the instruments rather than visual reference. 

Veit Stoss<====>32699<====>Veit Stoss Veit Stoss (also: Veit Stoß;  ; before 1450 – about 20 September 1533) was a leading German sculptor, mostly in wood, whose career covered the transition between the late Gothic and the Northern Renaissance.   His style emphasized pathos and emotion, helped by his virtuoso carving of billowing drapery; it has been called "late Gothic Baroque".  Snyder, 309   He had a large workshop and in addition to his own works there are a number by pupils.  He is best known for the altarpiece in St.  Mary's Basilica in Kraków, Poland. LifeStoss was born at Horb am Neckar before 1450; his exact date of birth is unknown though it may have been in 1447. 

Volcanic Explosivity Index<====>32700<====>Volcanic Explosivity Index The Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) is a relative measure of the explosiveness of volcanic eruptions.  It was devised by Chris Newhall of the United States Geological Survey and Stephen Self at the University of Hawaii in 1982. Volume of products, eruption cloud height, and qualitative observations (using terms ranging from "gentle" to "mega-colossal") are used to determine the explosivity value.  The scale is open-ended with the largest volcanoes in history given magnitude 8.  A value of 0 is given for non-explosive eruptions, defined as less than   of tephra ejected; and 8 representing a mega-colossal explosive eruption that can eject   (240 cubic miles) of tephra and have a cloud column height of over  .

Sarasvati River<====>32708<====>Sarasvati River  Sarasvati River (Sanskrit:  , IAST: sárasvatī nadī) is one of the  Rigvedic rivers mentioned in the Rig Veda and later Vedic and post-Vedic texts.  The Sarasvati River played an important role in Hinduism since Vedic Sanskrit.  The first part of the Rig Veda is believed to have originated when the Vedic people lived on its banks, during the 2nd millennium BCE.  The goddess Sarasvati was originally a personification of this river, but later developed an independent identity.   The Nadistuti hymn in the Rigveda (10. 75) mentions the Sarasvati between the Yamuna in the east and the Sutlej in the west. 

VTOL<====>32709<====>VTOL   A vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft is one that can hover, take off, and land vertically.  This classification can include a variety of types of aircraft including fixed-wing aircraft  as well as helicopters and other aircraft with powered rotors, such as cyclogyros/cyclocopters and tiltrotors.   Some VTOL aircraft can operate in other modes as well, such as CTOL (conventional take-off and landing), STOL (short take-off and landing), and/or STOVL (short take-off and vertical landing).  Others, such as some helicopters, can only operate by VTOL, due to the aircraft lacking landing gear that can handle horizontal motion. 

Vega<====>32712<====>VegaVega, also designated Alpha Lyrae (α Lyrae, abbreviated Alpha Lyr or α Lyr), is the brightest star in the constellation of Lyra, the fifth-brightest star in the night sky, and the second-brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere, after Arcturus.  It is relatively close at only 25 light-years from the Sun, and, together with Arcturus and Sirius, one of the most luminous stars in the Sun's neighborhood. Vega has been extensively studied by astronomers, leading it to be termed “arguably the next most important star in the sky after the Sun.

Condorcet paradox<====>32718<====>Condorcet paradox The Condorcet paradox (also known as voting paradox or the paradox of voting) in social choice theory is a situation noted by the Marquis de Condorcet in the late 18th century,    in which collective preferences can be cyclic, even if the preferences of individual voters are not cyclic.  This is paradoxical, because it means that majority wishes can be in conflict with each other: Majorities prefer, for example, candidate A over B, B over C, and yet C over A.  When this occurs, it is because the conflicting majorities are each made up of different groups of individuals.

Victoria Woodhull<====>32737<====>Victoria Woodhull Victoria Claflin Woodhull, later Victoria Woodhull Martin (September 23, 1838 – June 9, 1927) was an American leader of the women's suffrage movement. In 1872, Woodhull ran for President of the United States.  While many historians and authors agree that Woodhull was the first woman to run for President of the United States, some have questioned that priority given issues with the legality of her run.  They disagree with classifying it as a true candidacy because she was younger than the constitutionally mandated age of 35.   However, election coverage by contemporary newspapers does not suggest age was a significant issue.

Voltmeter<====>32743<====>Voltmeter A voltmeter is an instrument used for measuring electrical potential difference between two points in an electric circuit.  Analog voltmeters move a pointer across a scale in proportion to the voltage of the circuit; digital voltmeters give a numerical display of voltage by use of an analog to digital converter.  A voltmeter in a circuit diagram is represented by the letter V in a circle.  Voltmeters are made in a wide range of styles.  Instruments permanently mounted in a panel are used to monitor generators or other fixed apparatus.  Portable instruments, usually equipped to also measure current and resistance in the form of a multimeter, are standard test instruments used in electrical and electronics work.

Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations<====>32753<====>Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations  The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 is an international treaty that defines a framework for diplomatic relations between independent countries.  It specifies the privileges of a diplomatic mission that enable diplomats to perform their function without fear of coercion or harassment by the host country.  This forms the legal basis for diplomatic immunity.  Its articles are considered a cornerstone of modern international relations.  As of February 2017, it has been ratified by 191 states.    History Throughout the history of sovereign states, diplomats have enjoyed a special status. 

Valve<====>32754<====>Valve   A valve is a device that regulates, directs or controls the flow of a fluid (gases, liquids, fluidized solids, or slurries) by opening, closing, or partially obstructing various passageways.   Valves are technically fittings, but are usually discussed as a separate category.  In an open valve, fluid flows in a direction from higher pressure to lower pressure.   The word is derived from the Latin valva, the moving part of a door, in turn from volvere, to turn, roll. The simplest, and very ancient, valve is simply a freely hinged flap which drops to obstruct fluid (gas or liquid) flow in one direction, but is pushed open by flow in the opposite direction. 

Videos and audio recordings of Osama bin Laden<====>32755<====>Videos and audio recordings of Osama bin LadenThere were several video and audio recordings released by Osama bin Laden between 2001 and 2011.

Vinegar<====>32762<====>Vinegar Vinegar is a liquid consisting of about 5–20% acetic acid (CH 3 COOH), water, and other trace chemicals, which may include flavorings.  The acetic acid is produced by the fermentation of ethanol by acetic acid bacteria.   Vinegar is now mainly used as a cooking ingredient, or in pickling.  As the most easily manufactured mild acid, it has historically had a great variety of industrial, medical, and domestic uses, some of which (such as its use as a general household cleaner) are still commonly practiced today. Commercial vinegar is produced either by a fast or a slow fermentation process.

S.  Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), through which almost all wartime military R&D was carried out, including initiation and early administration of the Manhattan Project.  He is also known in engineering for his work on analog computers, for founding Raytheon, and for the memex, a hypothetical adjustable microfilm viewer with a structure analogous to that of hypertext.  In 1945, Bush published the essay "As We May Think" in which he predicted that "wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified". 

Von Hippel–Lindau disease<====>32768<====>Von Hippel–Lindau disease Von Hippel–Lindau disease (VHL), also known as Familial cerebello retinal angiomatosis, is a rare genetic disorder with multisystem involvement.  It is characterized by visceral cysts and benign tumors with potential for subsequent malignant transformation.  It is a type of phakomatosis that results from a mutation in the von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 3p25. 3.  ClassificationVHL disease can be subdivided according to the clinical manifestations, although these groups often correlate with certain types of mutations present in the VHL gene.    Signs and symptomsSigns and symptoms associated with VHL disease include headaches, problems with balance and walking, dizziness, weakness of the limbs, vision problems, and high blood pressure.

Venom<====>32771<====>Venom    Venom is a form of toxin secreted by an animal for the purpose of causing harm to another.    The potency of different venoms varies; lethal venoms are often characterised by the median lethal dose (LD 50 , LD50, or LD-50), expressed in terms of mass fraction (e. g. , milligrams of toxin per kilogram of body mass), that will kill 50% of the target of a specified type (e. g. , laboratory mice). Utilization of venom across a large number of species demonstrates an example of convergent evolution and a homoplastic trait.  It is difficult to conclude exactly how this trait came to be so intensely widespread and diversified. 

Virology<====>32772<====>Virology Virology is the study of viruses – submicroscopic, parasitic particles of genetic material contained in a protein coat   – and virus-like agents.  It focuses on the following aspects of viruses: their structure, classification and evolution, their ways to infect and exploit host cells for reproduction, their interaction with host organism physiology and immunity, the diseases they cause, the techniques to isolate and culture them, and their use in research and therapy.  Virology is considered to be a subfield of microbiology or of medicine. Virus structure and classificationA major branch of virology is virus classification.  Viruses can be classified according to the host cell they infect: animal viruses, plant viruses, fungal viruses, and bacteriophages (viruses infecting bacterium, which include the most complex viruses).

Antisemitism and the New Testament<====>32783<====>Antisemitism and the New Testament The idea that the New Testament is anti-Semitic is a controversy that has emerged with force in the aftermath of the Holocaust.  It is often associated with a thesis put forward by Rosemary Ruether,   and the various positions depend on how anti-Semitism is defined, and on scholarly disagreements over whether anti-Semitism has a monolithic continuous history, or is an umbrella term gathering in many distinct kinds of hostility to Jews over time.   James Dunn has argued that the New Testament contributed toward subsequent antisemitism in the Christian community.  James D. 

V-2 rocket<====>32786<====>V-2 rocket   The V-2 ( , "Retribution Weapon 2"), technical name Aggregat 4 (A4), was the world's first long-range  guided ballistic missile.  The missile, powered by a liquid-propellant rocket engine, was developed during the Second World War in Germany as a "vengeance weapon", assigned to attack Allied cities as retaliation for the Allied bombings against German cities.  The V-2 rocket also became the first man-made object to travel into space by crossing the Kármán line with the vertical launch of MW 18014 on 20 June 1944.  Research into military use of long range rockets began when the studies of graduate student Wernher von Braun attracted the attention of the German Army. 

Vodka<====>32787<====>Vodka  Vodka (from    ,    ) is a distilled beverage composed primarily of water and ethanol, sometimes with traces of impurities and flavorings.  Traditionally, vodka is made by the distillation of cereal grains or potatoes that have been fermented, though some modern brands use other substances, such as fruits or sugar. Since the 1890s, the standard Polish, Russian, Belarusian, Ukrainian, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian and Czech vodkas are 40% alcohol by volume ABV (80 US proof), a percentage that is widely misattributed to Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev.   The European Union has established a minimum of 37.

It is designed to combine the functionality of a conventional helicopter with the long-range, high-speed cruise performance of a turboprop aircraft. The failure of Operation Eagle Claw during the Iran hostage crisis in 1980 underscored the requirement for a new long-range, high-speed, vertical-takeoff aircraft for the United States Department of Defense.  In response, the Joint-service Vertical take-off/landing Experimental (JVX) aircraft program started in 1981.  A partnership between Bell Helicopter and Boeing Helicopters was awarded a development contract in 1983 for the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft.

Velar consonant<====>32819<====>Velar consonant  Velars are consonants articulated with the back part of the tongue (the dorsum)against the soft palate, the back part of the roof of the mouth (known also as the velum). Since the velar region of the roof of the mouth is relatively extensive and the movements of the dorsumare not very precise, velars easily undergo assimilation, shifting their articulation back or to the frontdepending on the quality of adjacent vowels.They often become automatically fronted, that is partly or completely palatal before a following front vowel, and retracted, that is partly or completely uvular before back vowels. 

V-1 flying bomb<====>32821<====>V-1 flying bomb   The V-1 flying bomb (  "Vengeance Weapon 1" )—also known to the Allies as the buzz bomb, or doodlebug,   and in Germany as Kirschkern (cherrystone) or Maikäfer (maybug) —was an early cruise missile and the only production aircraft to use a pulsejet for power. The V-1 was the first of the so-called "Vengeance weapons" (V-weapons or Vergeltungswaffen) series designed for terror bombing of London.  It was developed at Peenemünde Army Research Center in 1939 by the Nazi German Luftwaffe during the Second World War.  During initial development it was known by the codename "Cherry Stone". 

Very-large-scale integration<====>32823<====>Very-large-scale integration  Very-large-scale integration (VLSI) is the process of creating an integrated circuit (IC) by combining billions of transistors into a single chip.  VLSI began in the 1970s when complex semiconductor and communication technologies were being developed.  The microprocessor is a VLSI device.  Before the introduction of VLSI technology most ICs had a limited set of functions they could perform.  An electronic circuit might consist of a CPU, ROM, RAM and other glue logic.  VLSI lets IC designers add all of these into one chip. HistoryThe History of the transistor dates to the mid-1920s when several inventors attempted devices that were intended to control current in solid-state diodes and convert them into triodes.

Varicose veins<====>32834<====>Varicose veins  Varicose veins are veins that have become enlarged and twisted.  The term commonly refers to the veins on the leg,  although varicose veins can occur elsewhere.  Veins have pairs of leaflet valves to prevent blood from flowing backwards (retrograde flow or venous reflux).   Leg muscles pump the veins to return blood to the heart (the skeletal-muscle pump), against the effects of gravity.  When veins become varicose, the leaflets of the valves no longer meet properly, and the valves do not work (valvular incompetence).  This allows blood to flow backwards and they enlarge even more.

Wiki<====>32851<====>Wiki A wiki (   ) is a website on which users collaboratively modify content and structure directly from the web browser.  In a typical wiki, text is written using a simplified markup language and often edited with the help of a rich-text editor.    A wiki is run using wiki software, otherwise known as a wiki engine.  A wiki engine is a type of content management system, but it differs from most other such systems, including blog software, in that the content is created without any defined owner or leader, and wikis have little implicit structure, allowing structure to emerge according to the needs of the users. 

WikiWikiWeb<====>32864<====>WikiWikiWeb   The WikiWikiWeb is the first ever wiki, or user-editable website.  It was launched on 25 March 1995 by its inventor, programmer Ward Cunningham, to accompany the Portland Pattern Repository website discussing software design patterns.  The name WikiWikiWeb originally also applied to the wiki software that operated the website, written in the Perl programming language and later renamed to "WikiBase".  The site is frequently referred to by its users as simply "Wiki", and a convention established among users of the early network of wiki sites that followed was that using the word with a capitalized W referred exclusively to the original site. 

Warez<====>32881<====>Warez   Warez is a common computing and broader cultural term referring to pirated software (i. e.  illegally copied, often after deactivation of anti-piracy measures) that is distributed via the Internet.  Warez is used most commonly as a noun, a plural form of ware (short for computer software), and is intended to be pronounced like the word  ,  .  The circumvention of copy protection (cracking) is an essential step in generating warez, and based on this common mechanism, the software-focused definition has been extended to include other copyright-protected materials, including movies and games.  The global array of warez groups has been referred to as "The Scene," deriving from its earlier description as "the warez scene. 

Wedding<====>32893<====>Wedding    A wedding is a ceremony where two people or a couple are united in marriage.  Wedding traditions and customs vary greatly between cultures, ethnic groups, religions, countries, and social classes.  Most wedding ceremonies involve an exchange of marriage vows by the couple, presentation of a gift (offering, ring(s), symbolic item, flowers, money), and a public proclamation of marriage by an authority figure or celebrant.  Special wedding garments are often worn, and the ceremony is sometimes followed by a wedding reception.  Music, poetry, prayers or readings from religious texts or literature are also commonly incorporated into the ceremony. 

Waltz<====>32895<====>Waltz    The waltz (   ) is a ballroom and folk dance, normally in   time, performed primarily in closed position. HistoryThere are several references to a sliding or gliding dance that would evolve into the waltz that date from 16th century Europe, including the representations of the printmaker Hans Sebald Beham.  The French philosopher Montaigne wrote of a dance he saw in 1580 in Augsburg, where the dancers held each other so closely that their faces touched.  Kunz Haas (of approximately the same period) wrote, "Now they are dancing the godless Weller or Spinner. 

William Shakespeare<====>32897<====>William ShakespeareWilliam Shakespeare ( ;  26 April 1564 (baptised) – 23 April 1616)  was an English poet, playwright and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon".    His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 39 plays,  154 sonnets, two long narrative poems and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship.  His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. 

William Kennedy Dickson<====>32898<====>William Kennedy Dickson    William Kennedy-Laurie Dickson (3 August 1860 – 28 September 1935) was a Scottish inventor who devised an early motion picture camera under the employment of Thomas Edison (post-dating the work of Louis Le Prince).   Early lifeWilliam Kennedy Dickson was born on 3 August 1860 in Le Minihic-sur-Rance, Brittany, France.   His mother was Elizabeth Kennedy-Laurie (1823?–1879) who may have been born in Virginia.   His father was James Waite Dickson, a Scottish artist, astronomer and linguist.   James claimed direct lineage from the painter William Hogarth, and from Judge John Waite, the man who sentenced King Charles I to death.

Woody Allen<====>32901<====>Woody Allen    Heywood "Woody" Allen (born Allan Stewart Konigsberg; December 1, 1935)    is an American filmmaker, writer, actor, comedian, and musician whose career spans more than six decades. He worked as a comedy writer in the 1950s, writing jokes and scripts for television and publishing several books of short humor pieces.  In the early 1960s, Allen began performing as a stand-up comedian, emphasizing monologues rather than traditional jokes.  As a comedian, he developed the persona of an insecure, intellectual, fretful  , which he maintains is quite different from his real-life personality. 

Wim Wenders<====>32902<====>Wim Wenders Ernst Wilhelm "Wim" Wenders ( ; born 14 August 1945) is a German filmmaker, playwright, author, photographer, and a major figure in New German Cinema.  Among many honors, he has received three nominations for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature: for Buena Vista Social Club (1999), about Cuban music culture, Pina (2011), about the contemporary dance choreographer Pina Bausch, and The Salt of the Earth (2014), about Brazilian photographer Sebastião Salgado. One of Wenders' earliest honors was a win for the BAFTA Award for Best Direction for his narrative drama Paris, Texas (1984), which also won the Palme d'Or at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival. 

West Virginia<====>32905<====>West Virginia West Virginia   is a state located in the Appalachian region of the Southern United States.  Southeastern Division of the Association of American Geographers   It is bordered by Virginia to the southeast, Kentucky to the southwest, Ohio to the northwest, Pennsylvania to the north (and, slightly, east), and Maryland to the northeast.  West Virginia is the 10th smallest by area, is ranked 38th in population, and has the fourth-lowest household income of the United States.  The capital and largest city is Charleston. 

Warsaw<====>32908<====>WarsawWarsaw ( ;    ; see also other names) is the capital and largest city of Poland.  The metropolis stands on the Vistula River in east-central Poland and its population is officially estimated at 1. 760 million residents within a greater metropolitan area of 3. 101 million residents,    which makes Warsaw the 9th most-populous capital city in the European Union.  The city limits cover  , while the metropolitan area covers  .   Warsaw is an alpha global city, a major international tourist destination and a significant cultural, political and economic hub. 

Walt Disney<====>32917<====>Walt Disney  Walter Elias Disney ( ;  December 5, 1901 December 15, 1966) was an American entrepreneur, animator, voice actor and film producer.  A pioneer of the American animation industry, he introduced several developments in the production of cartoons.  As a film producer, Disney holds the record for most Academy Awards earned by an individual, having won 22 Oscars from 59 nominations.  He was presented with two Golden Globe Special Achievement Awards and an Emmy Award, among other honors.  Several of his films are included in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress. 

Watermark<====>32921<====>Watermark  A watermark is an identifying image or pattern in paper that appears as various shades of lightness/darkness when viewed by transmitted light (or when viewed by reflected light, atop a dark background), caused by thickness or density variations in the paper.  Watermarks have been used on postage stamps, currency, and other government documents to discourage counterfeiting.  There are two main ways of producing watermarks in paper; the dandy roll process, and the more complex cylinder mould process. Watermarks vary greatly in their visibility; while some are obvious on casual inspection, others require some study to pick out. 

Western canon<====>32923<====>Western canonThe Western canon is the body of books, music, and art that scholars generally accept as the most important and influential in shaping Western culture.  It includes works of fiction, non-fiction, poetry, drama, music, art, sculpture, and architecture generally perceived as being of major artistic merit and representing the high culture of Europe and North America.  University of California philosopher John Searle suggests that the Western canon can be roughly defined as "a certain Western intellectual tradition that goes from, say, Socrates to Wittgenstein in philosophy, and from Homer to James Joyce in literature".   The Bible, a product of Middle Eastern culture, has been a major force in shaping Western culture, and "has inspired some of the great monuments of human thought, literature, and art". 

World War II<====>32927<====>World War IIWorld War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier.  It involved the vast majority of the world's countries—including all of the great powers—eventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis.  It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries.  In a state of total war, the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. 

Wine<====>32961<====>Wine   Wine (from Latin vinum) is an alcoholic beverage made from grapes, generally Vitis vinifera, fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients.  Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide.  Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine.  These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process.  Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine.  These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. 

Worldcon<====>32975<====>Worldcon Worldcon, or more formally the  World Science Fiction Convention, the annual convention of the World Science Fiction Society (WSFS), is a science fiction convention.  It has been held each year since 1939 (except for the years 1942 to 1945, during World War II).The members of each Worldcon are the members of WSFS, and vote both to select the site of the Worldcon two years later, and to select the winners of the annual Hugo Awards, which are presented at each convention. ActivitiesActivities and events at the convention typically include (but are not limited to):Activities to support fan and external charities (fan funds auctions, blood drives, etc. 

Writing<====>32977<====>Writing  Writing is a medium of human communication that represents language and emotion with signs and symbols.  In most languages, writing is a complement to speech or spoken language.  Writing is not a language, but a tool used to make languages be read.  Within a language system, writing relies on many of the same structures as speech, such as vocabulary, grammar, and semantics, with the added dependency of a system of signs or symbols.  The result of writing is called text, and the recipient of text is called a reader.  Motivations for writing include publication, storytelling, correspondence, record keeping and diary. 

Whitehorse, Yukon<====>33056<====>Whitehorse, Yukon Whitehorse ( ) is the capital, and only city of Yukon and the largest city in northern Canada.  It was incorporated in 1950 and is located at kilometre 1426 on the Alaska Highway in southern Yukon.  Whitehorse's downtown and Riverdale areas occupy both shores of the Yukon River, which originates in British Columbia and meets the Bering Sea in Alaska.  The city was named after the White Horse Rapids for their resemblance to the mane of a white horse, near Miles Canyon, before the river was dammed. Because of the city's location in the Whitehorse valley, the climate is milder than comparable northern communities such as Yellowknife. 

White House<====>33057<====>White House The White House is the official residence and workplace of the President of the United States.  It is located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D. C. , and has been the residence of every U. S.  president since John Adams in 1800.  The term White House is often used as a metonym for the president and his advisers, as in "The White House announced that. . . ". The residence was designed by Irish-born architect James Hoban  in the neoclassical style.  Construction took place between 1792 and 1800 using Aquia Creek sandstone painted white. 

Warren G. Harding<====>33060<====>Warren G.  Harding    Warren Gamaliel Harding (November 2, 1865 – August 2, 1923) was an American politician who served as the 29th President of the United States from March 4, 1921 until his death in 1923.  At the time of his death, Harding was one of the most popular Presidents, but the subsequent exposure of scandals that took place under his administration such as Teapot Dome eroded his popular regard, as did revelations of an affair by Nan Britton, one of his mistresses.  In historical rankings of the U. S.  Presidents, Harding is often rated among the worst. 

Whist<====>33062<====>Whist Whist is a classic English trick-taking card game which was widely played in the 18th and 19th centuries.    Although the rules are simple, there is scope for scientific play.  HistoryWhist is a descendant of the 16th-century game of trump or ruff.  Whist replaced the popular variant of trump known as ruff and honours. The game takes its name from the 17th Century whist (or wist) meaning quiet, silent, attentive, which is the root of the modern wistful.  According to Barrington, whist was first played on scientific principles by a party of gentlemen who frequented the Crown Coffee House in Bedford Row, London, around 1728. 

William Withering<====>33065<====>William Withering   William Withering FRS (17 March 1741 – 6 October 1799) was an English botanist, geologist, chemist, physician and the discoverer of digitalis. IntroductionWithering was born in Wellington, Shropshire, the son of a surgeon.   He trained as a physician and studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh Medical School.  He worked at Birmingham General Hospital from 1779.  The story is that he noticed a person with dropsy (swelling from congestive heart failure) improve remarkably after taking a traditional herbal remedy; Withering became famous for recognising that the active ingredient in the mixture came from the foxglove plant. 

White elephant<====>33067<====>White elephant   A white elephant is a possession which its owner cannot dispose of and whose cost, particularly that of maintenance, is out of proportion to its usefulness.  In modern usage, it is an object, building project, scheme, business venture, facility, etc. , considered expensive but without use or value.  BackgroundThe term derives from the sacred white elephants kept by Southeast Asian monarchs in Burma, Thailand, Laos and Cambodia.   To possess a white elephant was regarded (and is still regarded in Thailand and Burma) as a sign that the monarch reigned with justice and power, and that the kingdom was blessed with peace and prosperity. 

Battle of Monte Cassino<====>33088<====>Battle of Monte CassinoThe Battle of Monte Cassino (also known as the Battle for Rome and the Battle for Cassino) was a costly series of four assaults by the Allies against the Winter Line in Italy held by Axis forces during the Italian Campaign of World War II.  The intention was a breakthrough to Rome. At the beginning of 1944, the western half of the Winter Line was being anchored by Germans holding the Rapido-Gari, Liri and Garigliano valleys and some of the surrounding peaks and ridges.  Together, these features formed the Gustav Line. 

Double-Cross System<====>33090<====>Double-Cross SystemThe Double-Cross System or XX System was a World War II counter-espionage and deception operation of the British Security Service, a civilian organisation usually referred to by its cover title MI5.  Nazi agents in Britain – real and false – were captured, turned themselves in or simply announced themselves, and were then used by the British to broadcast mainly disinformation to their Nazi controllers.  Its operations were overseen by the Twenty Committee under the chairmanship of John Cecil Masterman; the name of the committee comes from the number 20 in Roman numerals: "XX" (i. e.  a double cross). 

Juan Pujol García<====>33091<====>Juan Pujol GarcíaJuan Pujol García MBE (14 February 1912 – 10 October 1988) was a Spanish citizen who deliberately became a double agent against Nazi Germany during World War II.  He relocated to England to carry out fictional spying activities for the Nazis, and was known by the British codename Garbo and the German codename Alaric Arabel.    Pujol had the distinction of receiving military decorations from both sides during World War II, gaining both an Iron Cross from Germany and an MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) from Britain. 

Eddie Chapman<====>33093<====>Eddie Chapman   Edward Arnold Chapman (16 November 1914 – 11 December 1997) was an English criminal and wartime spy.  During the Second World War he offered his services to Nazi Germany as a spy and subsequently became a British double agent.  His British Secret Service handlers codenamed him Zigzag in acknowledgement of his rather erratic personal history.  He had a number of criminal aliases known by the British police, amongst them Edward Edwards, Arnold Thompson and Edward Simpson.  His German codename was Fritz or, later, after endearing himself to his German contacts, its diminutive form of Fritzchen. 

Battle of Kursk<====>33102<====>Battle of Kursk The Battle of Kursk was a Second World War engagement between German and Soviet forces on the Eastern Front near Kursk (  south-west of Moscow) in the Soviet Union during  July and August 1943.  The battle began with the launch of the German offensive, Operation Citadel ( ), on 5 July, which had the objective of pinching off the Kursk salient with attacks on the base of the salient from north and south simultaneously.  After the German offensive stalled on the northern side of the salient, on 12 July the Soviets commenced their Kursk Strategic Offensive Operation with the launch of Operation Kutuzov ( ) against the rear of the German forces in the northern side. 

Wargaming<====>33105<====>Wargaming   A wargame (also war game) is a strategy game that deals with military operations of various types, real or fictional.  Wargaming is the hobby dedicated to the play of such games, which can also be called conflict simulations, or consims for short. When used professionally by the military to study warfare, "war game" may refer to a simple theoretical study or a full-scale military exercise.  Hobby wargamers have traditionally used "wargame", while the military has generally used "war game";  this is not a hard and fast rule. Although there may be disagreements as to whether a particular game qualifies as a wargame or not, a general consensus exists that all such games must explore and represent some feature or aspect of human behaviour directly bearing on the conduct of war, even if the game subject itself does not concern organized violent conflict or warfare. 

Canellales<====>33108<====>Canellales Canellales is the botanical name for an order of flowering plants, one of the four orders of the magnoliids.   It is recognized by the most recent classification of flowering plants, the APG IV system.   It is defined to contain two families: Canellaceae and Winteraceae, which comprise 136 species of fragrant trees and shrubs.   The Canellaceae are found in tropical America and Africa, and the Winteraceae are part of the Antarctic flora (found in diverse parts of the southern hemisphere).   Although the order was defined based on phylogenetic studies, a number of possible synapomorphies have been suggested, relating to the pollen tube, the seeds, the thickness of the integument, and other aspects of the morphology. 

Wearable computer<====>33109<====>Wearable computer  Wearable computers, also known as body-borne computers or wearables, are miniature electronic devices that are worn under, with, or on top of clothing.  Mann, Steve (2012): Wearable Computing.  In: Soegaard, Mads and Dam, Rikke Friis (eds. ).  "Encyclopedia of Human-Computer Interaction".  Aarhus, Denmark: The Interaction-Design. org Foundation.   This class of wearable technology has been developed for general or special purpose information technologies.  It is also used in media development.  Wearable computers are especially useful for applications that require more complex computational support, such as accelerometers or gyroscopes, than just hardware coded logic strained by the physical hardware of the system. 

Wilhelm von Humboldt<====>33110<====>Wilhelm von Humboldt Friedrich Wilhelm Christian Karl Ferdinand von Humboldt ( ; 22 June 1767 – 8 April 1835) was a Prussian philosopher, linguist, government functionary, diplomat, and founder of the Humboldt University of Berlin, which was named after him in 1949 (and also after his younger brother, Alexander von Humboldt, a naturalist). He is especially remembered as a linguist who made important contributions to the philosophy of language and to the theory and practice of education.   In particular, he is widely recognized as having been the architect of the Humboldtian education ideal, which was used from the beginning in Prussia as a model for its system of education and eventually in countries such as the US and Japan. 

World War I casualties<====>33111<====>World War I casualties The total number of military and civilian casualties in World War I was more than 41 million: there were over 18 million deaths and 23 million wounded, ranking it among the deadliest conflicts in human history. The total number of deaths includes from 9 to 11 million military personnel and about 5 to 6 million civilians.  The Triple Entente (also known as the Allies) lost about 6 million military personnel while the Central Powers lost about 4 million.  At least 2 million died from diseases and 6 million went missing, presumed dead.  This article lists the casualties of the belligerent powers based on official published sources. 

World War I reparations<====>33112<====>World War I reparations World War I reparations were compensation imposed during the Paris Peace Conference upon the Central Powers following their defeat in the First World War by the Allied and Associate Powers.  Each of the defeated powers was required to make payments in either cash or kind.  Because of the financial situation Austria, Hungary, and Turkey found themselves in after the war, few to no reparations were paid and the requirements for reparations were cancelled.  Bulgaria, having paid only a fraction of what was required, saw its reparation figure reduced and then cancelled.  Historians have recognised the German requirement to pay reparations as the "chief battleground of the post-war era" and "the focus of the power struggle between France and Germany over whether the Versailles Treaty was to be enforced or revised". 

World Series of Poker<====>33116<====>World Series of Poker  The World Series of Poker (WSOP) is a series of poker tournaments    held annually in Las Vegas and, since 2005, sponsored by Caesars Entertainment Corporation (known as Harrah's Entertainment until 2010).   It dates its origins to 1970, when Benny Binion invited seven of the best-known poker players to the Horseshoe Casino for a single tournament, with a set start and stop time, and a winner determined by a secret ballot of the seven players.  The winner of each event receives a World Series of Poker bracelet and a monetary prize based on the number of entrants and buy-in amounts. 

William Barnes<====>33117<====>William Barnes   William Barnes (22 February 1801 – 7 October 1886) was an English writer, poet, Church of England priest, and philologist.  He wrote over 800 poems, some in Dorset dialect, and much other work, including a comprehensive English grammar quoting from more than 70 different languages. LifeBarnes was born at Rushay in the parish of Bagber, Dorset, the son of a farmer.  His formal education finished when he was 13 years old.Between 1818 and 1823 he worked in Dorchester, the county town, as a solicitor's clerk, then moved to Mere in neighbouring Wiltshire and opened a school. 

Woodworking<====>33118<====>Woodworking Woodworking is the activity or skill of making items from wood, and includes cabinet making (Cabinetry and Furniture), wood carving, joinery, carpentry, and woodturning. HistoryAlong with stone, clay and animal parts, wood was one of the first materials worked by early humans.  Microwear analysis of the Mousterian stone tools used by the Neanderthals show that many were used to work wood.  The development of civilization was closely tied to the development of increasingly greater degrees of skill in working these materials. Among early finds of wooden tools are the worked sticks from Kalambo Falls, Clacton-on-Sea and Lehringen. 

William Gibson<====>33119<====>William Gibson   William Ford Gibson (born March 17, 1948) is a Canadian-American speculative fiction writer and essayist widely credited with pioneering the science fiction subgenre known as cyberpunk.  Beginning his writing career in the late 1970s, his early works were noir, near-future stories that explored the effects of technology, cybernetics, and computer networks on humans—a "combination of lowlife and high tech" —and helped to create an iconography for the information age before the ubiquity of the Internet in the 1990s.   Gibson notably coined the term "cyberspace" in his short story "Burning Chrome" (1982) and later popularized the concept in his acclaimed debut novel Neuromancer (1984). 

Web crawler<====>33120<====>Web crawler   A Web crawler, sometimes called a spider, is an Internet bot that systematically browses the World Wide Web, typically for the purpose of Web indexing (web spidering). Web search engines and some other sites use Web crawling or spidering software to update their web content or indices of others sites' web content.  Web crawlers copy pages for processing by a search engine which indexes the downloaded pages so users  can search more efficiently. Crawlers consume resources on visited systems and often visit sites without approval.  Issues of schedule, load, and "politeness" come into play when large collections of pages are accessed. 

Wings of Desire<====>33121<====>Wings of Desire   Wings of Desire ( ) is a 1987 romantic fantasy film directed by Wim Wenders.  The film is about invisible, immortal angels who populate Berlin and listen to the thoughts of its human inhabitants, comforting those who are in distress.  Even though the city is densely populated, many of the people are isolated or estranged from their loved ones.  One of the angels, played by Bruno Ganz, falls in love with a beautiful, lonely trapeze artist, played by Solveig Dommartin.  The angel chooses to become mortal so that he can experience human sensory pleasures, ranging from enjoying food to touching a loved one, and so that he can discover human love with the trapeze artist. 

Wireless Valley<====>33123<====>Wireless ValleyWireless Valley is a term that was coined by Professor Ted Rappaport in 1990 when he was a faculty member at Virginia Tech, and was used to describe the Roanoke/Blacksburg, Virginia region and the potential of research to create spin-out companies.  In 1990 he and his students founded TSR Technologies, a company that made software-defined cellular and paging intercept and drive test equipment that was sold to Allen Telecom in 1993, and in 1995 Wireless Valley Communications, a company that pioneered the creation of computer-aided wireless network prediction and management software that was sold to Motorola in late 2005. 

Wild Strawberries (film)<====>33124<====>Wild Strawberries (film) Wild Strawberries is a 1957 Swedish drama film written and directed by Ingmar Bergman.  The original Swedish title is Smultronstället, which literally means "The wild strawberry patch" but idiomatically signifies an underrated gem of a place, often with personal or sentimental value.  The cast includes Victor Sjöström in his final screen performance as an old man recalling his past, as well as Bergman regulars Bibi Andersson, Ingrid Thulin and Gunnar Björnstrand.  Max von Sydow also appears in a small role.  Bergman wrote the screenplay while hospitalized.Exploring philosophical themes such as introspection and human existence, Wild Strawberries is often considered to be one of Bergman's greatest and most moving films. 

Wavelength<====>33125<====>Wavelength  In physics, the wavelength of a sinusoidal wave is the spatial period of the wave—the distance over which the wave's shape repeats,    and thus the inverse of the spatial frequency.  It is usually determined by considering the distance between consecutive corresponding points of the same phase, such as crests, troughs, or zero crossings and is a characteristic of both traveling waves and standing waves, as well as other spatial wave patterns.   Wavelength is commonly designated by the Greek letter lambda (λ).  The concept can also be applied to periodic waves of non-sinusoidal shape. 

The Wachowskis<====>33126<====>The WachowskisLana Wachowski (formerly Laurence "Larry" Wachowski, born June 21, 1965)    and Lilly Wachowski (formerly Andrew Paul "Andy" Wachowski, born December 29, 1967)  are American film directors, screenwriters, and producers.   They are siblings, and are both trans women.   Collectively known as the Wachowskis  ( ) and formerly as the Wachowski Brothers, the pair made their directing debut in 1996 with Bound, and achieved fame with their second film The Matrix (1999), a major box office success for which they won the Saturn Award for Best Director.

It is bordered by Minnesota to the west, Iowa to the southwest, Illinois to the south, Lake Michigan to the east, Michigan to the northeast, and Lake Superior to the north.  Wisconsin is the 23rd largest state by total area and the 20th most populous.  The state capital is Madison, and its largest city is Milwaukee, which is located on the western shore of Lake Michigan.  The state is divided into 72 counties. 

Summerfest<====>33129<====>SummerfestSummerfest is an annual music festival held at the   Henry Maier Festival Park along the lakefront in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  The festival lasts for 11 days, is made up of 11 stages with performances from over 800 acts and over 1000 performances.  Since the mid-1970s, it has run from late June through early July, usually including the 4th of July holiday.   Summerfest attracts between 800,000 and 900,000 people each year, promoting itself as "The World's Largest Music Festival", a title certified by the Guinness World Records since 1999.   Summerfest is operated by a non-profit board that hires the production staff to operate both the venue and main Summerfest event, which features local and nationally known music talent from a variety of music genres. 

Werner Heisenberg<====>33130<====>Werner Heisenberg Werner Karl Heisenberg ( ;   ; 5 December 1901 – 1 February 1976) was a German theoretical physicist and one of the key pioneers of quantum mechanics.  He published his work in 1925 in a breakthrough paper.  In the subsequent series of papers with Max Born and Pascual Jordan, during the same year,  this  matrix formulation of quantum mechanics was substantially elaborated.   He is known for the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which he published in 1927.  Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1932 "for the creation of quantum mechanics". 

Wireless telegraphy<====>33131<====>Wireless telegraphyWireless telegraphy is the transmission of electric telegraphy signals without wires (wirelessly).  The term is used synonymously for radio communication systems, also called radiotelegraphy, which transmit telegraph signals by radio waves.  When the term originated in the late 19th century it also applied to other types of experimental wireless telegraph communication technologies, such as conduction and induction telegraphy.   Radio telegraphy often used manually-sent Morse code; radioteletype (RTTY) always uses mechanically generated and recorded characters. OverviewWireless telegraphy or radiotelegraph, commonly called CW (continuous wave) telegraphy is a radio transmission system where the operator opens and closes a switch to interrupt a continuously transmitted wave. 

William Shockley<====>33132<====>William Shockley   William Bradford Shockley Jr.  ( ; February 13, 1910 – August 12, 1989) was an American physicist and inventor.  Shockley was the manager of a research group at Bell Labs that included John Bardeen and Walter Brattain.  The three scientists were jointly awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics for "their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect. "Shockley's attempts to commercialize a new transistor design in the 1950s and 1960s led to California's "Silicon Valley" becoming a hotbed of electronics innovation.  In his later life, Shockley was a professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University and became a proponent of eugenics. 

Walter Houser Brattain<====>33133<====>Walter Houser Brattain Walter Houser Brattain ( ; February 10, 1902 – October 13, 1987) was an American physicist at Bell Labs who, along with fellow scientists John Bardeen and William Shockley, invented the point-contact transistor in December 1947.   They shared the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics for their invention.  Brattain devoted much of his life to research on surface states. BiographyWalter Brattain was born in Xiamen, Fujian, China, to American parents Ross R.  Brattain and Ottilie Houser Brattain.Ross R.  Brattain was a teacher at the Ting-Wen Institute,   a private school for Chinese boys. 

World music<====>33134<====>World music  World music (also called global music or international music ) is a musical category encompassing many different styles of music from around the globe, which includes many genres including some forms of Western music represented by folk music, as well as selected forms of ethnic music, indigenous music, neotraditional music, and music where more than one cultural tradition, such as ethnic music and Western popular music, intermingle. World music's inclusive nature and elasticity as a musical category may pose for some obstacles to a universal definition, but its ethic of interest in the culturally exotic is encapsulated in fRoots magazine's description of the genre as "local music from out there". 

Wu-Tang Clan<====>33135<====>Wu-Tang Clan    The Wu-Tang Clan   is an American hip hop group from Staten Island, New York City, originally composed of East Coast rappers RZA, GZA, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Method Man, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Inspectah Deck, U-God and Masta Killa.  Cappadonna later became an official member of the group.  The Wu-Tang Clan has released four gold and platinum studio albums.  Its 1993 debut album, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), is considered to be one of the greatest albums in hip-hop history.    The Wu-Tang Clan has introduced and launched the careers of a number of affiliated artists and groups, often collectively known as the Wu-Tang Killa Bees,    and has been described as one of the most influential hip-hop groups of all-time. 

Werner Herzog<====>33138<====>Werner Herzog   Werner Herzog  ( ; born 5 September 1942) is a German screenwriter, film director, author, actor, and opera director. Herzog is considered one of the greatest figures of the New German Cinema, along with Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Margarethe von Trotta, Volker Schlöndorff, Werner Schröter, and Wim Wenders.  Herzog's films often feature ambitious protagonists with impossible dreams,    people with unique talents in obscure fields, or individuals who are in conflict with nature.    French filmmaker François Truffaut once called Herzog "the most important film director alive. "  American film critic Roger Ebert said that Herzog "has never created a single film that is compromised, shameful, made for pragmatic reasons, or uninteresting. 

World Wide Web<====>33139<====>World Wide WebThe World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet.   English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989.  He wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland.  The Web browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet in August 1991. 

Wireless LAN<====>33143<====>Wireless LAN A wireless local area network (WLAN) is a wireless computer network that links two or more devices using wireless communication within a limited area such as a home, school, computer laboratory, or office building.  This gives users the ability to move around within a local coverage area and yet still be connected to the network.  Through a gateway, a WLAN can also provide a connection to the wider Internet. Most modern WLANs are based on IEEE 802. 11 standards and are marketed under the Wi-Fi brand name. Wireless LANs have become popular for use in the home, due to their ease of installation and use. 

World Wide Web Consortium<====>33149<====>World Wide Web Consortium   The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or W3). Founded and currently led by Tim Berners-Lee,    the consortium is made up of member organizations which maintain full-time staff for the purpose of working together in the development of standards for the World Wide Web.   , the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has 463 members.  The W3C also engages in education and outreach, develops software and serves as an open forum for discussion about the Web. HistoryThe World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) (Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire) in October, 1994. 

Whisky<====>33153<====>Whisky Whisky or whiskey  is a type of distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented grain mash.  Various grains (which may be malted) are used for different varieties, including barley, corn (maize), rye, and wheat.  Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks, generally made of charred white oak. Whisky is a strictly regulated spirit worldwide with many classes and types.  The typical unifying characteristics of the different classes and types are the fermentation of grains, distillation, and aging in wooden barrels. EtymologyThe word whiskey (or whisky) is an anglicisation of the Classical Gaelic word uisce (or uisge) meaning "water" (now written as uisce in Irish Gaelic, and uisge in Scottish Gaelic). 

War<====>33158<====>War  War is a state of armed conflict between states or societies.  It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces.  An absence of war is usually called "peace".  Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general.   Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant suffering and casualties. While some scholars see war as a universal and ancestral aspect of human nature,  others argue it is a result of specific socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. 

Ward Cunningham<====>33161<====>Ward Cunningham   Howard G.  "Ward" Cunningham (born May 26, 1949 ) is an American computer programmer who developed the first wiki.  A pioneer in both design patterns and extreme programming, he started programming the software WikiWikiWeb in 1994 and installed it on the website of his software consultancy, Cunningham & Cunningham (commonly known by its domain name, c2. com), on March 25, 1995, as an add-on to the Portland Pattern Repository.  He is one of the 17 original signatories of the Agile Manifesto. He lives in Beaverton, Oregon, and is a programmer at New Relic. 

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart<====>33163<====>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart  Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (   ;   ; 27 January 1756 – 5 December 1791), baptised as Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart,  was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical era. Born in Salzburg, he showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood.  Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty.  At 17, Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court, but grew restless and traveled in search of a better position.  While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. 

Wiki software<====>33164<====>Wiki software Wiki software (also known as a wiki engine or wiki application ) is a collaborative software that runs a wiki, which allows users to create and collaboratively edit "pages" or entries via a web browser.  A wiki system is usually a web application that runs on one or more web servers.  The content, including all current and previous revisions, is usually stored in either a file system or a database.  Wikis are a type of web content management system, and the most commonly supported off-the-shelf software that web hosting facilities offer. There are currently dozens of actively maintained wiki engines, in a variety of programming languages, including both open source and proprietary applications. 

Westphalia<====>33165<====>Westphalia  Westphalia ( ;    ) is a region in northwestern Germany and one of the three historic parts of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.  It has an area of   and 7. 9 million inhabitants. The region is almost identical with the Province of Westphalia which was a part of the Kingdom of Prussia from 1815 to 1918 Deutsches Kaiserreich: Provinz Westfalen  and the Free State of Prussia from 1918 to 1946.  In 1946, Westphalia merged with the Northern Rhineland, another former part of Prussia, to form the newly created state of North Rhine-Westphalia. 

West Germany<====>33166<====>West Germany West Germany is the common English name for the Federal Republic of Germany ( ) in the period between its creation on 23 May 1949 and German reunification on 3 October 1990.  During this Cold War era, NATO-aligned West Germany and Warsaw Pact-aligned East Germany were divided by the Inner German border.  After 1961 West Berlin was physically separated from East Berlin as well as from East Germany by the Berlin Wall.  This situation ended when East Germany was dissolved and split into five states, which then joined the ten states of the Federal Republic of Germany along with the reunified city-state of Berlin. 

West Berlin<====>33170<====>West Berlin West Berlin (  or colloquially West-Berlin) was a political enclave which comprised the western part of Berlin during the years of the Cold War.  There was no specific date on which the sectors of Berlin occupied by the Western Allies became "West Berlin", but 1949 is widely accepted as the year in which the name was adopted.  West Berlin was formally controlled by the Western Allies and formed a de facto part of West Germany, even though it was entirely surrounded by the Soviet-controlled East Berlin and East Germany.  West Berlin had great symbolic significance during the Cold War, as it was widely considered by westerners as an "island of freedom". 

War film<====>33171<====>War film    War film is a film genre concerned with warfare, typically about naval, air, or land battles, with combat scenes central to the drama.  It has been strongly associated with the 20th century.    The fateful nature of battle scenes means that war films often end with them.   Themes explored include combat, survival and escape, sacrifice, the futility and inhumanity of battle, the effects of war on society, and the moral and human issues raised by war.  War films are often categorized by their milieu, such as the Korean War; the most popular subject is the Second World War. 

Wireless network<====>33172<====>Wireless network A wireless network is a computer network that uses wireless data connections between network nodes.  Wireless networking is a method by which homes, telecommunications networks and business installations avoid the costly process of introducing cables into a building, or as a connection between various equipment locations.   Wireless telecommunications networks are generally implemented and administered using radio communication.  This implementation takes place at the physical level (layer) of the OSI model network structure.  Examples of wireless networks include cell phone networks, wireless local area networks (WLANs), wireless sensor networks, satellite communication networks, and terrestrial microwave networks. 

Web browser<====>33173<====>Web browser    A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application for retrieving, presenting and traversing information resources on the World Wide Web.  An information resource is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI/URL) that may be a web page, image, video or other piece of content.   Hyperlinks present in resources enable users easily to navigate their browsers to related resources. Although browsers are primarily intended to use the World Wide Web, they can also be used to access information provided by web servers in private networks or files in file systems. 

Wharf<====>33174<====>Wharf   A wharf, quay ( , also   ), staith or staithe is a structure on the shore of a harbor or on the bank of a river or canal where ships may dock to load and unload cargo or passengers.  Such a structure includes one or more berths (mooring locations), and may also include piers, warehouses, or other facilities necessary for handling the ships.  Wharfs are often considered to be a series of docks in which boats are stationed. OverviewA wharf commonly comprises a fixed platform, often on pilings.  Commercial ports may have warehouses that serve as interim storage areas, since the typical objective is to unload and reload vessels as quickly as possible. 

William Blake<====>33175<====>William BlakeWilliam Blake (28 November 1757 – 12 August 1827) was an English poet, painter, and printmaker.  Largely unrecognised during his lifetime, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the poetry and visual arts of the Romantic Age.  What he called his prophetic works were said by 20th-century critic Northrop Frye to form "what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language".   His visual artistry led 21st-century critic Jonathan Jones to proclaim him "far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced". 

Demon dialing<====>33176<====>Demon dialing In the computer hacking scene of the 1980s, demon dialing was a technique by which a computer was used to repeatedly dial a number (usually to a crowded modem pool) in an attempt to gain access immediately after another user had hung up.   The expansion of accessible internet service provider connectivity since that time has rendered the practice more or less obsolete. A similar technique was sometimes used to get the first call for prizes in radio "call-in" shows, thus leading to the adoption of random "fifth caller," "seventeenth caller" etc.  by radio stations to circumvent this practice. 

White supremacy<====>33178<====>White supremacy   White supremacy or white supremacism is a racist ideology based upon the belief that white people are superior in many ways to people of other races and that therefore white people should be dominant over other races.  White supremacy has roots in scientific racism and it often relies on pseudoscientific arguments.  Like most similar movements such as neo-Nazism, white supremacists typically oppose people of color, Jews, and non-Protestants. The term is also typically used to describe a political ideology that perpetuates and maintains the social, political, historical or institutional domination by white people (as evidenced by historical and contemporary sociopolitical structures such as the Atlantic slave trade, Jim Crow laws in the United States, and apartheid in South Africa). 

W<====>33180<====>WW (named double-u, Pronounced  ,  ,  ,  , or    plural double-ues)   is the 23rd letter of the modern English and ISO basic Latin alphabets. HistoryThe sounds   (spelled  ) and   (spelled  ) of Classical Latin developed into a bilabial fricative   between vowels in Early Medieval Latin.  Therefore,   no longer adequately represented the labial-velar approximant sound   of Germanic phonology. The Germanic   phoneme was therefore written as   or   (  and   becoming distinct only by the Early Modern period. 

Woman<====>33183<====>Woman A woman is a female human being.  The term woman is usually reserved for an adult, with the term girl being the usual term for a female child or adolescent.  The term woman is also sometimes used to identify a female human, regardless of age, as in phrases such as "women's rights".  Women with typical genetic development are usually capable of giving birth from puberty until menopause.  With regard to gender, a woman may also be a person whose sex assignment does not align with their gender identity, Sexual Orientation and Gender Expression in Social Work Practice, edited by Deana F. 

Waffen-SS<====>33186<====>Waffen-SS   The Waffen-SS ( , Armed SS) was the armed wing of the Nazi Party's SS organisation.  Its formations included men from Nazi Germany, along with volunteers and conscripts from both occupied and un-occupied lands.  The Waffen-SS grew from three regiments to over 38 divisions during World War II, and served alongside the Heer (regular army), Ordnungspolizei (uniformed police) and other security units.  Originally, it was under the control of the SS Führungshauptamt (SS operational command office) beneath Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler.  With the start of World War II, tactical control was exercised by the High Command of the Armed Forces (OKW),  with some units being subordinated to Kommandostab Reichsführer-SS (Command Staff Reichsführer-SS) directly under Himmler's control. 

W. Somerset Maugham<====>33187<====>W.  Somerset Maugham  William Somerset Maugham CH (   ; 25 January 1874 – 16 December 1965), better known as W.  Somerset Maugham, was a British playwright, novelist and short story writer.  He was among the most popular writers of his era and reputedly the highest-paid author during the 1930s.  After both his parents died before he was 10, Maugham was raised by a paternal uncle who was emotionally cold.  Not wanting to become a lawyer like other men in his family, Maugham eventually trained and qualified as a physician.  The initial run of his first novel, Liza of Lambeth (1897), sold out so rapidly that Maugham gave up medicine to write full-time. 

Wake Island<====>33189<====>Wake Island    Wake Island (also known as Wake Atoll) is a coral atoll in the western Pacific Ocean in the northeastern area of the Micronesia subregion,   east of Guam,   west of Honolulu and   southeast of Tokyo.  The island is an unorganized, unincorporated territory of the United States Minor Outlying Islands that is also claimed by the Republic of the Marshall Islands.  Wake Island is one of the most isolated islands in the world and the nearest inhabited island is Utirik Atoll in the Marshall Islands,   to the southeast. 

Wallis and Futuna<====>33199<====>Wallis and Futuna  Wallis and Futuna, officially the Territory of the Wallis and Futuna Islands  ( ;or  , Fakauvea and Fakafutuna:  ), is a French island collectivity in the South Pacific between Tuvalu to the northwest, Fiji to the southwest, Tonga to the southeast, Samoa to the east, and Tokelau to the northeast.  Though both French and Polynesian, Wallis and Futuna is distinct from the entity known as French Polynesia. Its land area is   with a population of about  .

FinanceThe GDP of Wallis and Futuna in 2005 was 188 million US dollars at market exchange rates.The GDP per capita was 12,640 US dollars in 2005 (at market exchange rates, not at PPP), which is lower than in New Caledonia, French Polynesia, and all the other French overseas departments and territories (except Mayotte), but higher than in all the small insular independent states of Oceania. Along with the French territories of New Caledonia and French Polynesia, the territory uses the CFP Franc, which is fixed vs. 

West Bank<====>33209<====>West Bank The West Bank (   ;  , HaGadah HaMa'aravit) is a landlocked territory near the Mediterranean coast of Western Asia, the bulk of it now under Israeli control,  or else under joint Israeli-Palestinian Authority control.  The final status of the entire area is yet to be determined by the parties concerned.   The West Bank shares boundaries (demarcated by the Jordanian-Israeli armistice of 1949) to the west, north, and south with Israel, and to the east, across the Jordan River, with Jordan.  The West Bank also contains a significant section of the western Dead Sea shore. 

Western Sahara<====>33220<====>Western Sahara  Western Sahara ( ; ,  , Spanish and French: Sahara Occidental) is a disputed territory in the Maghreb region of North Africa, partially controlled by the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic and partially Moroccan-occupied, bordered by Morocco proper to the north, Algeria to the northeast, Mauritania to the east and south, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west.  Its surface area amounts to  .  It is one of the most sparsely populated territories in the world, mainly consisting of desert flatlands.  The population is estimated at just over 500,000,    of which nearly 40% live in Laayoune, the largest city in Western Sahara. 

History of Western Sahara<====>33221<====>History of Western Sahara The history of Western Sahara can be traced back to the times of Carthaginian explorer Hanno the Navigator in the 5th century BC.  Though few historical records are left from that period, Western Sahara's modern history has its roots linked to some nomadic groups (living under Berber tribal rule and in contact with the Roman Empire) such as the Sanhaja group and the introduction of Islam and the Arabic language the end from the 8th century AD.  The Western Sahara has never been a nation in the modern sense of the word.  It was home to Phoenician colonies, but those disappeared with virtually no trace. 

Geography of Western Sahara<====>33222<====>Geography of Western Sahara   Western Sahara is a territory in Northern Africa, bordered by the North Atlantic Ocean, Morocco proper, Algeria (Tindouf region), and Mauritania.    Geographic coordinates:  SizeTotal: 266,060 km², about the size of Coloradoland: 266,000 km²water: 0 km²Coastline: 1,110 km;Land boundaries: 2,046 km, Algeria 42 km, Mauritania 1,561 km, Morocco 443 kmSaguia el-Hamra is the northern third with the city El Aaiún. Río de Oro is the southern two-thirds (south of Cape Bojador), with the city Dakhla. The peninsula in the extreme southwest, with the city of Lagouira, is called Ras Nouadhibou, Cap Blanc, or Cabo Blanco. 

Demographics of Western Sahara<====>33223<====>Demographics of Western Sahara   All data about demographic information regarding Western Sahara is extremely error prone, regardless of source.   Most countries take censuses every ten years, and some every five in order to stay abreast of change and miscounts; the last count was conducted in 1970, and even that data by colonial Spain is considered unreliable due to large nomadic populations. Following the 1975 Green March, the Moroccan state has sponsored settlement schemes enticing thousands of Moroccans to move into the Moroccan-occupied part of Western Sahara (80% of the territory).  By 2015, it was estimated that Moroccan settlers made up at least two thirds of the 500,000 inhabitants. 

Politics of Western Sahara<====>33224<====>Politics of Western Sahara  The politics of Western Sahara take place in a framework of an area claimed by both the partially recognized Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic and the Kingdom of Morocco, which controls the majority of the territory. Colonized by Spain from 1884 to 1975, as Spanish Sahara, the territory has been listed with the United Nations as a case of incomplete decolonization since the 1960s, making it the last major territory to effectively remain a colony, according to the UN.   The conflict is largely between the Kingdom of Morocco and the national liberation movement known as Polisario Front (Popular Front for the Liberation of the Saguia el-Hamra and Río de Oro), which in February 1976 formally proclaimed the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), now basically administered by a government in exile in Tindouf, Algeria. 

Economy of Western Sahara<====>33225<====>Economy of Western Sahara    The majority of the territory of Western Sahara  - the Southern Provinces - is currently administered by the Kingdom of Morocco.  As such, the majority of the economical activity of Western Sahara happens in the framework of the economy of Morocco. In the Moroccan-administered territory, fishing and phosphate mining are the principal sources of income for the population.  The territory lacks sufficient rainfall for sustainable agricultural production,  hence most of the food for the urban population must be imported.  All trade and other economic activities are controlled by the Moroccan government, as usual in Western Sahara. 

Telecommunications in Western Sahara<====>33226<====>Telecommunications in Western SaharaTelecommunications in Western Sahara include radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet. Morocco claims the Western Sahara territory and administers Moroccan law through Moroccan institutions in the estimated 85 percent of the territory it controls.  The Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia el Hamra and Rio de Oro (Polisario), an organization that has sought independence for the former Spanish territory since 1973, disputes Morocco’s claim to sovereignty over the territory.   Because of this long running dispute, many traditional telecommunication statistics are not reported separately for the Western Sahara.  Radio and television Radio stations: Morocco's state broadcaster, Société Nationale de Radiodiffusion et de Télévision (SNRT, formerly RTM) operates a radio service from Laayoune (2008); "Communications: Western Sahara", World Factbook, U. 

Transport in Western Sahara<====>33227<====>Transport in Western SaharaTransport in Western Sahara is very limited by sea, road and air with camels being the primary means of transport in the desert area.   Road transport by buses remain the major mode of transportation.  The longest conveyor belt in the world is   long, from the phosphate mines of Bu Craa to the coast south of Laayoune.  The belt moves about 2,000 metric tons of rock containing phosphate every hour from the mines to El-Aaiun, where it is loaded and shipped. Portions of Western Sahara were a Spanish Colony till 1975 as the last colonial province in Africa. 

Political status of Western Sahara<====>33229<====>Political status of Western Sahara  Western Sahara, formerly the Spanish colony of Spanish Sahara, is a disputed territory claimed by both the Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front.  It is listed by the United Nations (UN), as a non-decolonized territory and is thus included in the United Nations List of Non-Self-Governing Territories. Since the Madrid Accords of 1975, a part of Western Sahara has been administered by Morocco as the Southern Provinces.  Another section, the Liberated Territories, is administered by the Polisario Front as the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR).  Mauritania administers temporally the western half of the Ras Nouadhibou Peninsula.

White matter<====>33234<====>White matter White matter refers to areas of the central nervous system (CNS) that are mainly made up of myelinated axons, also called tracts.   Long thought to be passive tissue, white matter affects learning and brain functions, modulating the distribution of action potentials, acting as a relay and coordinating communication between different brain regions.  White matter is named for its relatively light appearance resulting from the lipid content of myelin.   However, the tissue of the freshly cut brain appears pinkish white to the naked eye because myelin is composed largely of lipid tissue veined with capillaries. 

Word processor<====>33236<====>Word processor A word processor is an electronic device or computer software application that performs the task of composing, editing, formatting, and printing of documents. The word processor was a stand-alone office machine in the 1960s, combining the keyboard text-entry and printing functions of an electric typewriter with a recording unit, either tape or floppy disk (as used by the Wang machine) with a simple dedicated computer processor for the editing of text.   Although features and designs varied among manufacturers and models, and new features were added as technology advanced, word processors typically featured a monochrome display and the ability to save documents on memory cards or diskettes. 

WorldForge<====>33254<====>WorldForge  The WorldForge project is producing an open source framework for massively multiplayer online role-playing games.  The intent lies in creating a widely used development framework and set of libraries by motivating interested developers to improve on the original source code. HistoryThe WorldForge Project began in October 1998, under the original name of "Altima. " It was originally envisioned to be an "Alternative to Ultima Online" and was mentioned in an article on the Slashdot news website,  which became a major source of interested developers. The original founder has since left the project along with most pre-Slashdot developers. 

Widescreen<====>33263<====>Widescreen Widescreen images are images that are displayed within a set of aspect ratios (relationship of image width to height) that is used in film, television and computer screens.  In film, a widescreen film is any film image with a width-to-height aspect ratio greater than the standard 1. 37:1 Academy aspect ratio provided by 35mm film. For television, the original screen ratio for broadcasts was 4:3 (1. 33:1).

Weighted arithmetic mean<====>33274<====>Weighted arithmetic mean The weighted arithmetic mean is similar to an ordinary arithmetic mean (the most common type of average), except that instead of each of the data points contributing equally to the final average, some data points contribute more than others.  The notion of weighted mean plays a role in descriptive statistics and also occurs in a more general form in several other areas of mathematics. If all the weights are equal, then the weighted mean is the same as the arithmetic mean.   While weighted means generally behave in a similar fashion to arithmetic means, they do have a few counterintuitive properties, as captured for instance in Simpson's paradox.

Wire-frame model<====>33292<====>Wire-frame model  A wire-frame model is a visual presentation of a 3-dimensional (3D) or physical object used in 3D computer graphics.  It is created by specifying each edge of the physical object where two mathematically continuous smooth surfaces meet, or by connecting an object's constituent vertices using straight lines or curves.  The object is projected into screen space by drawing lines at the location of each edge.  The term wire frame comes from designers using metal wire to represent the three-dimensional shape of solid objects.  3D wire frame allows to construct and manipulate solids and solid surfaces.

Wankel engine<====>33303<====>Wankel engine   The Wankel engine is a type of internal combustion engine using an eccentric rotary design to convert pressure into rotating motion.  In contrast to the more common reciprocating piston designs, the Wankel engine delivers advantages of simplicity, smoothness, compactness, high revolutions per minute, and a high power-to-weight ratio primarily because three power pulses per rotor revolution are produced compared to one per revolution in a two-stroke piston engine and one per two revolutions in a four-stroke piston engine, although at the actual output shaft, there is only one power pulse per revolution.  Since the output shaft spins three times as fast as the actual rotor, as can be seen in the animation below, it makes it roughly equivalent to a 2-stroke piston engine of the same displacement.

Water<====>33306<====>Water    Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms.  Its chemical formula is H 2 O, meaning that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms that are connected by covalent bonds.  Strictly speaking, water refers to the liquid state of a substance that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor).  It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity.

Wave–particle duality<====>33426<====>Wave–particle duality  Wave–particle duality is the concept in quantum mechanics  that every particle or quantic entity may be partly described in terms not only of particles, but also of waves.  It expresses the inability of the classical concepts "particle" or "wave" to fully describe the behavior of quantum-scale objects.  As Albert Einstein wrote:  Through the work of Max Planck, Einstein, Louis de Broglie, Arthur Compton, Niels Bohr and many others, current scientific theory holds that all particles also have a wave nature (and vice versa).   This phenomenon has been verified not only for elementary particles, but also for compound particles like atoms and even molecules.

Well-order<====>33456<====>Well-orderIn mathematics, a well-order (or well-ordering or well-order relation) on a set S is a total order on S with the property that every non-empty subset of S has a least element in this ordering.  The set S together with the well-order relation is then called a well-ordered set.  In some academic articles and textbooks these terms are instead written as wellorder, wellordered, and wellordering or well order, well ordered, and well ordering. Every non-empty well-ordered set has a least element.  Every element s of a well-ordered set, except a possible greatest element, has a unique successor (next element), namely the least element of the subset of all elements greater than s. 

Well-ordering theorem<====>33458<====>Well-ordering theorem  In mathematics, the well-ordering theorem states that every set can be well-ordered.  A set X is well-ordered by a strict total order if every non-empty subset of X has a least element under the ordering.  This is also known as Zermelo's theorem and is equivalent to the axiom of choice (see also Axiom of choice).    Ernst Zermelo introduced the Axiom of Choice as an "unobjectionable logical principle" to prove the well-ordering theorem.  This is important because it makes every set susceptible to the powerful technique of transfinite induction.  The well-ordering theorem has consequences that may seem paradoxical, such as the Banach–Tarski paradox. 

Weapon<====>33496<====>Weapon   A weapon, arm, or armament is any device used with intent to inflict damage or harm to living creatures, structures, or systems.  Weapons are used to increase the efficacy and efficiency of activities such as hunting, crime, law enforcement, self-defense, and warfare.  In a broader context, weapons may be construed to include anything used to gain a strategic, material or mental advantage over an adversary. While ordinary objects such as sticks, stones, cars, or pencils can be used as weapons, many are expressly designed for the purpose – ranging from simple implements such as clubs, swords and guns, to complicated modern intercontinental ballistic missiles, biological and cyberweapons. 

Wire<====>33498<====>Wire   A wire is a single, usually cylindrical, flexible strand or rod of metal.  Wires are used to bear mechanical loads or electricity and telecommunications signals.  Wire is commonly formed by drawing the metal through a hole in a die or draw plate.  Wire gauges come in various standard sizes, as expressed in terms of a gauge number.  The term wire is also used more loosely to refer to a bundle of such strands, as in "multistranded wire", which is more correctly termed a wire rope in mechanics, or a cable in electricity. Wire comes in solid core, stranded, or braided forms. 

White dwarf<====>33501<====>White dwarf   A white dwarf, also called a degenerate dwarf, is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter.  A white dwarf is very dense: its mass is comparable to that of the Sun, while its volume is comparable to that of Earth.  A white dwarf's faint luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy; no fusion takes place in a white dwarf wherein mass is converted to energy.   The nearest known white dwarf is Sirius B, at 8. 6 light years, the smaller component of the Sirius binary star.  There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the Sun. 

Wabash College<====>33507<====>Wabash College  Wabash College is a small, private, liberal arts college for men, located in Crawfordsville, Indiana, United States.  Founded in 1832 by several Dartmouth College graduates and Midwestern leaders, Wabash is ranked in the top tier of national liberal arts colleges by U. S.  News & World Report.    Wabash is one of the country's three remaining male-only liberal arts colleges. HistoryThe college was initially named "The Wabash Teachers Seminary and Manual Labor College", a name shortened to its current form by 1851.  Many of the founders were Presbyterian ministers, yet nevertheless believed that Wabash should be independent and non-sectarian. 

Walking<====>33509<====>Walking Walking (also known as ambulation) is one of the main gaits of locomotion among legged animals.  Walking is typically slower than running and other gaits.   Walking is defined by an 'inverted pendulum' gait in which the body vaults over the stiff limb or limbs with each step.  This applies regardless of the number of limbs—even arthropods, with six, eight or more limbs, walk. Difference from running  The word walk is descended from the Old English wealcan "to roll".  In humans and other bipeds, walking is generally distinguished from running in that only one foot at a time leaves contact with the ground and there is a period of double-support. 

War of the Polish Succession<====>33514<====>War of the Polish SuccessionThe War of the Polish Succession (1733–35) was a major European war sparked by a Polish civil war over the succession to Augustus II, which the other European powers widened in pursuit of their own national interests.  France and Spain, the two Bourbon powers, attempted to check the power of the Austrian Habsburgs in western Europe, as did the Kingdom of Prussia, whilst Saxony and Russia mobilized to support the eventual Polish victor.  The slight amount of fighting in Poland resulted in the accession of Augustus III, who in addition to Russia and Saxony, was politically supported by the Habsburgs. 

Wave<====>33516<====>Wave In physics, a wave is an oscillation accompanied by a transfer of energy.  Frequency refers to the addition of time.  Wave motion transfers energy from one point to another, which displace particles of the transmission medium–that is, with little or no associated mass transport.  Waves consist, instead, of oscillations or vibrations (of a physical quantity), around almost fixed locations. A wave is a disturbance that transfers energy through matter or space. There are two main types of waves.  Mechanical waves propagate through a medium, and the substance of this medium is deformed.  Restoring forces then reverse the deformation. 

William McKinley<====>33521<====>William McKinley   William McKinley (January 29, 1843 – September 14, 1901) was the 25th President of the United States from March 4, 1897 until his assassination in September 1901, six months into his second term.  McKinley led the nation to victory in the Spanish–American War, raised protective tariffs to promote American industry, and maintained the nation on the gold standard in a rejection of inflationary proposals. McKinley was the last president to have served in the American Civil War, and the only one to have started the war as an enlisted soldier, beginning as a private in the Union Army and ending as a brevet major. 

William Howard Taft<====>33522<====>William Howard TaftWilliam Howard Taft (September 15, 1857 – March 8, 1930) served as the 27th President of the United States (1909–1913) and as the tenth Chief Justice of the United States (1921–1930), the only person to have held both offices.  Taft was elected president in 1908, the chosen successor of Theodore Roosevelt, but was defeated for re-election by Woodrow Wilson in 1912 after Roosevelt split the Republican vote by running as a third-party candidate.  In 1921, President Warren G.  Harding appointed Taft to be chief justice, a position in which he served until a month before his death. 

Woodrow Wilson<====>33523<====>Woodrow WilsonThomas Woodrow Wilson (December 28, 1856 – February 3, 1924) was an American statesman and academic who served as the 28th President of the United States from 1913 to 1921.  A member of the Democratic Party, Wilson served as the President of Princeton University from 1902 to 1910 and then ran and was elected as a progressive Democrat to the office of Governor of New Jersey.   Wilson's victory in the 1912 presidential election made him the first Southerner elected to the presidency since Zachary Taylor in 1848.    He also led the United States during World War I, establishing an activist foreign policy known as "Wilsonianism. 

William Allen (governor)<====>33531<====>William Allen (governor) William Allen (December 18 or 27, 1803 – July 11, 1879) was a Democratic Representative, Senator and 31st Governor of Ohio. Early life and familyAllen was born in Edenton, North Carolina and moved to Chillicothe, Ohio in 1819, after his parents' death.  He was of Quaker ancestry.    Allen and his sister Mary Granberry Allen lived in Chillicothe together.  His sister married Reverend Pleasant Thurman, and their son, Allen G.  Thurman, followed in his uncle's footsteps, becoming a lawyer and politician. Allen attended Chillicothe Academy before studying law with Colonel Edward King. 

William Randolph Hearst<====>33536<====>William Randolph Hearst   William Randolph Hearst Sr.  ( ;  April 29, 1863 – August 14, 1951) was an American businessman, politician, and newspaper publisher who built the nation's largest newspaper chain and media company Hearst Communications and whose flamboyant methods of yellow journalism influenced the nation's popular media by emphasizing sensationalism and human interest stories.  Hearst entered the publishing business in 1887 after being given control of The San Francisco Examiner by his wealthy father.  Moving to New York City, he acquired The New York Journal and fought a bitter circulation war with Joseph Pulitzer's New York World that sold papers by giant headlines over lurid stories featuring crime, corruption, graphics, sex, and innuendo. 

Wing<====>33537<====>Wing  A wing is a type of fin that produces lift, while moving through air or some other fluid.  As such, wings have streamlined cross-sections that are subject to aerodynamic forces and act as an airfoils.  A wing's aerodynamic efficiency is expressed as its lift-to-drag ratio.  The lift a wing generates at a given speed and angle of attack can be one to two orders of magnitude greater than the total drag on the wing.  A high lift-to-drag ratio requires a significantly smaller thrust to propel the wings through the air at sufficient lift. Lifting structures used in water, include various foils, including hydrofoils. 

Week<====>33538<====>Week A week is a time unit equal to seven days.  It is the standard time period used for cycles of rest days in most parts of the world, mostly alongside—although not strictly part of—the Gregorian calendar. The days of the week were named after the classical planets (derived from the astrological system of planetary hours) in the Roman era.  In English, the names are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. ISO 8601 includes the ISO week date system, a numbering system for weeks within a given year – each week begins on a Monday and is associated with the year that contains that week's Thursday (so that if a year starts in a long weekend Friday–Sunday, week number one of the year will start after that). 

White trash<====>33539<====>White trash White trash is a derogatory American English racial slur referring to poor white people, especially in the rural southern United States.  The label signifies lower social class inside the white population and especially a degraded standard of living.  The term has been adopted for people living on the fringes of the social order, who are seen as dangerous because they may be criminal, unpredictable, and without respect for authority whether it be political, legal, or moral.   The term is usually a racial slur,  but may also be used self-referentially by working class whites to jokingly describe their origins or lifestyle. 

Welsh language<====>33545<====>Welsh language  Welsh (  or  , pronounced  ) is a member of the Brittonic branch of the Celtic languages.  It is spoken natively in Wales, by few in England, and in Y Wladfa (the Welsh colony in Chubut Province, Argentina).   Historically, it has also been known in English as "Cambrian",  "Cambric"  and "Cymric".  The United Kingdom Census 2011 recorded that 19% of people aged three and over who live in Wales can speak Welsh, a decrease from the 20. 8% recorded in 2001.  An overall increase in the size of the Welsh population, most of whom are not Welsh speakers, appears to correspond with a fall in the number of Welsh speakers in Wales - from 582,000 in 2001 to 562,000 in 2011. 

Wood<====>33550<====>Wood   Wood is a porous and fibrous structural tissue found in the stems and roots of trees and other woody plants.  It is an organic material, a natural composite of cellulose fibers that are strong in tension and embedded in a matrix of lignin that resists compression.  Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary xylem in the stems of trees,  or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or shrubs.   In a living tree it performs a support function, enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves. 

Wheel<====>33555<====>Wheel    A wheel is a circular component that is intended to rotate on an axle bearing.  The wheel is one of the key components of the wheel and axle which is one of the six simple machines.  Wheels, in conjunction with axles, allow heavy objects to be moved easily facilitating movement or transportation while supporting a load, or performing labor in machines.  Wheels are also used for other purposes, such as a ship's wheel, steering wheel, potter's wheel and flywheel. Common examples are found in transport applications.  A wheel greatly reduces friction by facilitating motion by rolling together with the use of axles. 

Whaling<====>33557<====>Whaling   Whaling is the hunting of whales for their usable products like meat, oil and blubber.  Its earliest forms date to at least circa 3000 BC.   Various coastal communities have long histories of subsistence whaling and harvesting beached whales.  Industrial whaling emerged with organized fleets in the 17th century; competitive national whaling industries in the 18th and 19th centuries; and the introduction of factory ships along with the concept of whale harvesting in the first half of the 20th century.  By the late 1930s, more than 50,000 whales were killed annually  In 1986, the International Whaling Commission (IWC) banned commercial whaling because of the extreme depletion of most of the whale stocks. 

Wipe (transition)<====>33559<====>Wipe (transition)  A wipe is a type of film transition where one shot replaces another by travelling from one side of the frame to another or with a special shape.  If the wipe proceeds from two opposite edges of the screen toward the center or vice versa, it is known as a barn door wipe (named for its similarity to a pair of doors opening or closing). The following are some specific styles of wipes:An iris slow is a wipe that takes the shape of a growing or shrinking circle.  It has been frequently used in animated short subjects, such as those in the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoon series, to signify the end of a story. 

The Wizard of Speed and Time<====>33560<====>The Wizard of Speed and Time The Wizard of Speed and Time is a 1989 low-budget feature film written, directed, and starring animator Mike Jittlov, as well as a 1979 16 mm short film, also by Jittlov. 1979 Short filmIn the original short film, a young man in a green wizard costume runs throughout America at super speed, much like the superhero The Flash.   Along the way, he gives a pretty girl a swift lift to another city, gives golden stars to other women who want a trip themselves.   He then slips on a banana peel and comically crashes into a film stage, which he then brings to life in magical ways. 

Word problem for groups<====>33563<====>Word problem for groupsIn mathematics, especially in the area of abstract algebra known as combinatorial group theory, the word problem for a finitely generated group G is the algorithmic problem of deciding whether two words in the generators represent the same element.  More precisely, if A is a finite set of generators for G then the word problem is the membership problem for the formal language of all words in A and a formal set of inverses that map to the identity under the natural map from the free monoid with involution on A to the group G.   If B is another finite generating set for G, then the word problem over the generating set B is equivalent to the word problem over the generating set A. 

Waring's problem<====>33569<====>Waring's problemIn number theory, Waring's problem asks whether each natural number k  has an associated positive integer s such that every natural number is the sum of at most s natural numbers to the power of k.  For example, every natural number is the sum of at most 4 squares, 9 cubes, or 19 fourth powers.  Waring's problem was proposed in 1770 by Edward Waring, after whom it is named.  Its affirmative answer, known as the Hilbert–Waring theorem, was provided by Hilbert in 1909.   Waring's problem has its own Mathematics Subject Classification, 11P05, "Waring's problem and variants. 

Williams tube<====>33571<====>Williams tube The Williams tube, or the Williams–Kilburn tube after inventors Freddie Williams (26 June 1911 – 11 August 1977), and Tom Kilburn (11 August 1921 – 17 January 2001),    is an early form of computer memory.  It was the first random-access digital storage device,  and was used successfully in several early computers. The Williams tube works by displaying a grid of dots on a cathode ray tube (CRT).  Due to the way CRTs work, this creates a small charge of static electricity over each dot.  The charge at the location of each of the dots is read by a thin metal sheet just in front of the display. 

Wallace and Gromit<====>33573<====>Wallace and Gromit   Wallace and Gromit is a British clay animation comedy series created by Nick Park of Aardman Animations.  The series consists of four short films and a feature-length film.  The series centres on Wallace, a good-natured, eccentric, cheese-loving inventor, along with his companion Gromit, a silent yet loyal and intelligent anthropomorphic dog.  Wallace was originally voiced by veteran actor Peter Sallis, but as of 2011, this role has been passed on to Ben Whitehead.  Gromit remains silent, communicating only through means of facial expressions and body language. Because of their widespread popularity, the characters have been described as positive international icons of both modern British culture and British people in general.

War of the Spanish Succession<====>33604<====>War of the Spanish Succession   The War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714) was a major European conflict of the early 18th century, triggered by the death in 1700 of the last Habsburg King of Spain, the infirm and childless Charles II.  Charles II had ruled over a vast global empire, and the question of who would succeed him had long troubled the governments of Europe.  Attempts to solve the problem by peacefully partitioning the empire among the eligible candidates from the royal houses of France (Bourbon), Austria (Habsburg), and Bavaria (Wittelsbach) ultimately failed, and on his deathbed Charles II fixed the entire Spanish inheritance on his grandnephew Philip, Duke of Anjou, the second-eldest grandson of King Louis XIV of France.

William McGonagall<====>33612<====>William McGonagall   William Topaz McGonagall (March 1825    – 29 September 1902) was a Scottish weaver, poet and actor.  He won notoriety as an extremely bad poet who exhibited no recognition of, or concern for, his peers' opinions of his work. He wrote about 200 poems, including "The Tay Bridge Disaster" and "The Famous Tay Whale", which are widely regarded as some of the worst in English literature.  Groups throughout Scotland engaged him to make recitations from his work, and contemporary descriptions of these performances indicate that many listeners were appreciating McGonagall's skill as a comic music hall character.
