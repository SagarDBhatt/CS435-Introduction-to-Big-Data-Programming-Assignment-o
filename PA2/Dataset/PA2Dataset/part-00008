Carolingian Empire<====>62229<====>Carolingian Empire  The Carolingian Empire (800–888) was a large empire in western and central Europe during the early Middle Ages.  It was ruled by the Carolingian dynasty, which had ruled as kings of the Franks since 751 and as kings of the Lombards of Italy from 774.  In 800, the Frankish king Charlemagne was crowned emperor in Rome by Pope Leo III in an effort to revive the Roman Empire in the west during a vacancy in the throne of the eastern Roman Empire.  After a civil war (840–43) following the death of Emperor Louis the Pious, the empire was divided into autonomous kingdoms, with one king still recognised as emperor, but with little authority outside his own kingdom. 

Notre-Dame de Paris<====>62233<====>Notre-Dame de Paris    Notre-Dame de Paris ( ; meaning "Our Lady of Paris"), also known as Notre-Dame Cathedral or simply Notre-Dame, is a medieval Catholic cathedral on the Île de la Cité in the fourth arrondissement of Paris, France.   The cathedral is widely considered to be one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture, and it is among the largest and best-known church buildings in the Catholic Church in France, and in the world.  The naturalism of its sculptures and stained glass serve to contrast it with earlier Romanesque architecture. As the cathedral of the Archdiocese of Paris, Notre-Dame contains the cathedra of the Archbishop of Paris, currently Cardinal André Vingt-Trois. 

Junípero Serra<====>62237<====>Junípero Serra  Junípero Serra y Ferrer, O. F. M. , ( ;  ,  ) (November 24, 1713 August 28, 1784) was a Roman Catholic Spanish priest and friar of the Franciscan Order who founded a mission in Baja California and the first nine of 21 Spanish missions in California from San Diego to San Francisco, in what was then Alta California in the Province of Las Californias, New Spain. Serra was beatified by Pope John Paul II on September 25, 1988, in Vatican City.  Pope Francis canonised him on September 23, 2015, at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D. 

Abu Bakr bin Yahya al-Suli<====>62238<====>Abu Bakr bin Yahya al-SuliAbu Bakr Muhammad bin Yahya al-Suli ( ) (born: 266–267 A. H/ 880 A. D in Gorgan - died: 334–335 A. H/ 946 A. D in Basra) (aged 68-69.  lunar calendar) was a nadim (boon companion) of successive Abbasid caliphs.  He was noted for his poetry and scholarship and wrote a chronicle called Akhbar al-Radi wa'l-Muttaqi, detailing the reigns of the caliphs al-Radi and al-Muttaqi.  He was a legendary shatranj (an ancestor of chess) player, still remembered to this day. Upon the death of al-Radi in 940, al-Suli fell into disfavour with the new ruler due to his sympathies towards Shi'a Islam and as a result had to go into exile at Basra, where he spent the rest of his life in poverty. 

House of Valois<====>62241<====>House of Valois    The House of Valois  ( ) was a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty.  They succeeded the House of Capet (or "Direct Capetians") to the French throne, and were the royal house of France from 1328 to 1589.  Junior members of the family founded cadet branches in Orléans, Anjou, Burgundy, and Alençon. The Valois descended from Charles, Count of Valois (1270–1325), the second surviving son of King Philip III of France (reigned 1270–1285).  Their title to the throne was based on a precedent in 1316 (later retroactively attributed to the Merovingian Salic law), which excluded females (Joan II of Navarre) as well as male descendants through the distaff line (Edward III of England), from the succession to the French throne. 

French First Republic<====>62243<====>French First Republic  In the history of France, the First Republic, officially the French Republic ( ), was founded on 22 September 1792 during the French Revolution.  The First Republic lasted until the declaration of the First Empire in 1804 under Napoleon, although the form of the government changed several times.  This period was characterized by the fall of the monarchy, the establishment of the National Convention and the Reign of Terror, the Thermidorian Reaction and the founding of the Directory, and, finally, the creation of the Consulate and Napoleon's rise to power. End of the monarchy in FranceUnder the Legislative Assembly, which was in power before the proclamation of the First Republic, France was engaged in war with Prussia and Austria. 

Bourbon Restoration<====>62244<====>Bourbon Restoration   The Bourbon Restoration was the period of French history following the fall of Napoleon in 1814 until the July Revolution of 1830.  The brothers of executed Louis XVI of France came to power and reigned in highly conservative fashion, and exiled supporters of the monarchy returned to France.  They were nonetheless unable to reverse most of the changes made by the French Revolution and Napoleon.   At the Congress of Vienna they were treated respectfully, but had to give up all the territorial gains made since 1789. King Louis XVI of the House of Bourbon had been overthrown and executed during the French Revolution (1789–1799), which in turn was followed by Napoleon as ruler of France.

Backus–Naur form<====>62247<====>Backus–Naur form In computer science, Backus–Naur form or Backus normal form (BNF) is a notation technique for context-free grammars, often used to describe the syntax of languages used in computing, such as computer programming languages, document formats, instruction sets and communication protocols.  They are applied wherever exact descriptions of languages are needed: for instance, in official language specifications, in manuals, and in textbooks on programming language theory. Many extensions and variants of the original Backus–Naur notation are used; some are exactly defined, including extended Backus–Naur form (EBNF) and augmented Backus–Naur form (ABNF). HistoryThe idea of describing the structure of language using rewriting rules can be traced back to at least the work of Pāṇini (ancient Indian Sanskrit grammarian and a revered scholar in Hinduism who lived sometime between the 7th and 4th century BCE). 

Ctenophora<====>62251<====>Ctenophora   Ctenophora ( ; singular ctenophore,   or  ; from the Greek κτείς kteis 'comb'  and φέρω pherō 'carry'; commonly known as comb jellies) is a phylum of invertebrate animals that live in marine waters worldwide.  They are notable for the groups of cilia they use for swimming (commonly referred to as "combs"), and they are the largest animals that swim by means of cilia.  Depending on the species, adult ctenophores range from a few millimeters to   in size.  Only 100–150 species have been validated, and possibly another 25 have not been fully described and named. 

Nantucket<====>62254<====>Nantucket  Nantucket   is an island about   by ferry  south from Cape Cod, in the U. S.  state of Massachusetts.  Together with the small islands of Tuckernuck and Muskeget, it constitutes the Town of Nantucket, and the conterminous Nantucket County, which are consolidated.  As of the 2010 census, the population was 10,172.Part of the town is designated the Nantucket CDP, or census-designated place.  The region of Surfside on Nantucket is the southernmost settlement in Massachusetts. The name "Nantucket" is adapted from similar Algonquian names for the island, perhaps meaning "faraway land or island". 

Heterotardigrada<====>62261<====>Heterotardigrada The class Heterotardigrada includes tardigrades (water bears) that have cephalic appendages and legs with four separate but similar digits or claws on each.  444 species have been described.The anatomy of the reproductive system is an important defining feature in distinguishing the different groups of tardigrades.   Heterotardigrades have gonoducts that open to the outside through a preanal gonopore, rather than opening into the rectum as in the only other confirmed class of tardigrades, the Eutardigrada (the third class, Mesotardigrada, is represented by a single species whose reference material was destroyed in an earthquake, so its reproductive anatomy has not been studied recently). 

Lewis Milestone<====>62262<====>Lewis Milestone  Lewis Milestone (born Leib Milstein;  September 30, 1895 – September 25, 1980) was a Moldovan-born American motion picture director.  He is known for directing Two Arabian Knights (1927) and All Quiet on the Western Front (1930), both of which received Academy Awards for Best Director.  He also directed The Front Page (1931 – nomination), The General Died at Dawn (1936), Of Mice and Men (1939), Ocean's 11 (1960), and received the directing credit for Mutiny on the Bounty (1962), though Marlon Brando largely appropriated his responsibilities during its production.  Life and careerMilestone was born in Kishinev, in the Bessarabia Governorate of the Russian Empire (now Chişinău, Moldova), to a family of Jewish heritage. 

Macaw<====>62263<====>Macaw    Macaws are long-tailed, often colorful New World parrots.  BiologyOf the many different Psittacidae (true parrots) genera, six are classified as macaws: Ara, Anodorhynchus, Cyanopsitta, Primolius, Orthopsittaca, and Diopsittaca.  Previously, the members of the genus Primolius were placed in Propyrrhura, but the former is correct in accordance with ICZN rules.   Macaws are native to Central America and North America (only Mexico), South America, and formerly the Caribbean.  Most species are associated with forests, especially rainforests, but others prefer woodland or savannah-like habitats.  Abramson, J. , Speer, B.  L. , & Thomsen, J. 

Australian cuisine<====>62264<====>Australian cuisine  Australian cuisine refers to the cuisine of Australia and its indigenous and colonial societies.  Indigenous Australians have occupied Australia for some 40,000 to 60,000 years, during which they developed a unique hunter-gatherer diet, known as "bush tucker", drawn from regional Australian flora and fauna—such as the kangaroo.  Australia was, from 1788 to 1900, a collection of British colonies in which culinary tastes were strongly influenced by British and Irish migrants - and agricultural products such as beef cattle, sheep and wheat became staples in the Australian diet.  Post-war Australia's multicultural immigration program lead to a diversification of the cuisine of Australia, particularly under the influence of Mediterranean and East Asian Australians. 

William Wyler<====>62266<====>William Wyler  William Wyler (July 1, 1902 – July 27, 1981) was an American film director, producer and screenwriter.  Notable works include Ben-Hur (1959), The Best Years of Our Lives (1946), and Mrs.  Miniver (1942), all of which won Academy Awards for Best Director, as well as Best Picture in their respective years, making him the only director of three Best Picture winners as of 2017.  Wyler received his first Oscar nomination for directing Dodsworth in 1936, starring Walter Huston, Ruth Chatterton and Mary Astor, "sparking a 20-year run of almost unbroken greatness. " Freer, Ian. 

Psittacidae<====>62267<====>Psittacidae The family Psittacidae is one of three families of true parrots.  It comprises the rough 10 species of subfamily Psittacinae (the Old World or Afrotropical parrots) and 157 of subfamily Arinae (the New World or Neotropical parrots), as well as several species that have gone extinct in recent centuries.    Some of the most iconic birds in the world are represented here, such as the blue-and-gold macaw among the New World parrots and the African grey parrot among the Old World parrots.   These parrots are found in tropical and subtropical zones and inhabit Mexico, Central and South America, the Caribbean islands, sub-Saharan Africa, and the island of Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula. 

Mesotardigrada<====>62275<====>Mesotardigrada  The class Mesotardigrada   has only one species, Thermozodium esakii.    The animal has six claws of equal length at each foot. This species was recorded in 1937 by Rahm from a hot spring near Nagasaki in Japan. Unfortunately, the locus typicus has been destroyed by an earthquake and subsequent searches for specimens have been unsuccessful. The type specimen has also been lost, so the status of this class is considered dubious. References External linksTardigrade phylogenetics  

Monarchy of Belgium<====>62276<====>Monarchy of Belgium  The monarchy of Belgium is a constitutional, popular and hereditary monarchy whose incumbent is titled the King or Queen of the Belgians ( ,  ,  ) and serves as the country's head of state.  There have been seven Belgian monarchs since independence in 1830. The incumbent, Philippe, ascended the throne on 21 July 2013, following the abdication of his father. OriginsWhen Belgium became independent in 1830 the National Congress chose a constitutional monarchy as the form of government.  The Congress voted on the question on 22 November 1830, supporting monarchy by 174 votes to 13. 

Ben Hecht<====>62277<====>Ben Hecht Ben Hecht   (February 28, 1894 – April 18, 1964) was an American screenwriter, director, producer, playwright, journalist, and novelist.  A journalist in his youth, he went on to write thirty-five books and some of the most entertaining screenplays and plays in America.  He received screen credits, alone or in collaboration, for the stories or screenplays of some seventy films. At the age of 16, Hecht ran away to Chicago, where, in his own words, he "haunted streets, whorehouses, police stations, courtrooms, theater stages, jails, saloons, slums, madhouses, fires, murders, riots, banquet halls, and bookshops". 

Naxos<====>62278<====>Naxos    Naxos ( ; Greek:  ,  ) is a Greek island.  It was the centre of archaic Cycladic culture.  The island is famous as a source of emery, a rock rich in corundum, which until modern time was one of the best abrasives available. The largest town and capital of the island is Chora or Naxos City, with 6,533 inhabitants (2001 census).  The main villages are Filoti, Apiranthos, Vivlos, Agios Arsenios, Koronos and Glinado. GeographyClimateClimate is Mediterranean, with relatively mild winters and very warm summers.   The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is "Csa".

Sircam<====>62283<====>SircamSircam is a computer worm that propagates by e-mail from Microsoft Windows systems. It begins with one of the following lines of text and has an attachment consisting of the worm's executable with some file from the infected computer appended. It affected computers running Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows ME (Millennium) .I send you this file in order to have your adviceI hope you like the file that I sendo youI hope you can help me with this file that I sendThis is the file with the information you ask forTe mando este archivo para que me des tu punto de vista    Espero te guste este archivo que te mandoEspero me puedas ayudar con el archivo que te mandoEste es el archivo con la informacion que me pedisteDue to a bug in the worm, the message was rarely sent in any form other than "I send you this file in order to have your advice." This subsequently became an in-joke among those who were using the Internet at the time, and were spammed with e-mails containing this string sent by the worm.Sircam was notable during its outbreak for the way it distributed itself.  Document files (usually .doc or .xls) on the infected computer were chosen at random, infected with the virus and emailed out to email addresses in the host's address book.  Opening the infected file resulted in infection of the target computer.  During the outbreak, many personal or private files were emailed to people who otherwise should not have received them.It also spreads via open shares on a network.  Sircam scans the network for computers with shared drives and copy itself to a machine with an open (non-password protected) drive or directory.  A simple RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is then executed to start the process on the target machine, usually unknown to the owner of the now-compromised computer.Over a year after the initial 2001 outbreak, Sircam was still in the top 10 on virus charts.See alsoTimeline of computer viruses and wormsReferences   

Eutardigrade<====>62284<====>Eutardigrade Eutardigrada are a class of tardigrades (Tardigrada) without lateral appendices.  Primarily freshwater bound, some species have secondarily gained the ability to live in marine environments (Halobiotus).  By cryptobiosis many species are able to live temporarily in very dry environments.  More than 700 species have been described.    The order Apochela consists of only one family, Milnesiidae, with two genera: Milnesium and Limmenius.  Milnesium tardigradum can be found worldwide and is one of the biggest species among tardigrades (up to 1. 4 mm); similar-looking species have been found in Cretaceous amber.The mouth of this predator has a wide opening, so the animal can eat rotifers and larger protists. 

Cartouche<====>62286<====>Cartouche In Egyptian hieroglyphs, a cartouche   is an oval with a horizontal line at one end, indicating that the text enclosed is a royal name.   They came into common use during the beginning of the Fourth Dynasty under Pharaoh Sneferu, but earlier examples date to the mid Second Dynasty on Cylinder Seals of Seth-Peribsen.    While the cartouche is usually vertical with a horizontal line, if it makes the name fit better it can be horizontal, with a vertical line at the end (in the direction of reading). The Ancient Egyptian word for it was shenu, and it was essentially an expanded shen ring. 

Monosodium glutamate<====>62289<====>Monosodium glutamate  Monosodium glutamate (MSG, also known as sodium glutamate) is the sodium salt of glutamic acid, one of the most abundant naturally occurring non-essential amino acids.Monosodium glutamate is found naturally in tomatoes, cheese and other foods.    MSG is used in the food industry as a flavor enhancer with an umami taste that intensifies the meaty, savory flavor of food, as naturally occurring glutamate does in foods such as stews and meat soups.   It was first prepared in 1908 by Japanese biochemist Kikunae Ikeda, who was trying to isolate and duplicate the savory taste of kombu, an edible seaweed used as a base for many Japanese soups. 

Dinoflagellate<====>62290<====>Dinoflagellate The dinoflagellates (Greek δῖνος dinos "whirling" and Latin flagellum "whip, scourge") are a large group of flagellate eukaryotes that constitute the phylum Dinoflagellata.  Most are marine plankton, but they are common in freshwater habitats, as well.  Their populations are distributed depending on temperature, salinity, or depth.   Many dinoflagellates are known to be photosynthetic, but a large fraction of these are in fact mixotrophic, combining photosynthesis with ingestion of prey (phagotrophy).   In terms of number of species, dinoflagellates form one of the largest groups of marine eukaryotes, although this group is substantially smaller than the diatoms. 

Ciliata<====>62296<====>CiliataCiliata may refer to:The ciliates, a group of ciliated protistsCiliata (genus), a genus of fishes in the family Lotidae 

Alveolate<====>62297<====>Alveolate The alveolates (meaning "with cavities")  are a group of protists, considered a major clade    and superphylum    within Eukarya, and are also called Alveolata.    CharacteristicsThe most notable shared characteristic is the presence of cortical (outer-region) alveoli (sacs).  These are flattened vesicles (sacs) packed into a continuous layer just under the membrane and supporting it, typically forming a flexible pellicle (thin skin).   In dinoflagellates they often form armor plates.   Alveolates have mitochondria with tubular cristae (ridges), and their flagellae or cilia have a distinct structure. Almost all sequenced mitochondrial genomes of ciliates and apicomplexia are linear. 

Cryptomonad<====>62299<====>Cryptomonad  The cryptomonads (or cryptophytes)  are a group of algae,    most of which have plastids.   They are common in freshwater, and also occur in marine and brackish habitats.  Each cell is around 10–50 μm in size and flattened in shape, with an anterior groove or pocket.  At the edge of the pocket there are typically two slightly unequal flagella. Some may exhibit mixotrophy.    CharacteristicsCryptomonads are distinguished by the presence of characteristic extrusomes called ejectisomes or ejectosomes, which consist of two connected spiral ribbons held under tension.If the cells are irritated either by mechanical, chemical or light stress, they discharge, propelling the cell in a zig-zag course away from the disturbance. 

229 BC<====>62303<====>229 BC   Year 229 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.  At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Albinus and Centumalus (or, less frequently, year 525 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 229 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. Events By placeAnatoliaAttalus I of Pergamon wins the Battle of the Harpasus in western Anatolia. IllyriaThe First Illyrian War starts when the Roman Senate dispatches an army under the command of the consuls Lucius Postumius Albinus and Gnaeus Fulvius Centumalus to Illyria.

Forgery<====>62312<====>Forgery    Forgery is the process of making, adapting, or imitating objects, statistics, or documents with the intent to deceive for the sake of altering the public perception, or to earn profit by selling the forged item.  Copies, studio replicas, and reproductions are not considered forgeries, though they may later become forgeries through knowing and willful misrepresentations.  Forging money or currency is more often called counterfeiting.  But consumer goods may also be counterfeits if they are not manufactured or produced by the designated manufacturer or producer given on the label or flagged by the trademark symbol. 

Pharmacia<====>62313<====>Pharmacia Pharmacia was a pharmaceutical and biotechnological company in Sweden that merged with the American pharmaceutical company Upjohn in 1995. HistoryPharmacia company was founded in 1911 in Stockholm, Sweden by pharmacist Gustav Felix Grönfeldt at the Elgen Pharmacy.    The company is named after the Greek word φαρμακεία, transliterated pharmakeia, which means 'sorcery'.  In the company's early days, much of its profits were derived from the "miracle medicine" Phospho-Energon. During World War II, Swedish chemist Björn Ingelman (who worked for Arne Tiselius at Uppsala university) researched various uses for the polysaccharide dextran.  Together with the medical researcher Anders Grönwall, he discovered that dextran could be used as a replacement for blood plasma in blood transfusions, for which there could be a large need in wartime.

Closure (computer programming)<====>62319<====>Closure (computer programming)  In programming languages, closures (also lexical closures or function closures) are techniques for implementing lexically scoped name binding in languages with first-class functions.  Operationally, a closure is a record storing a function  together with an environment:  a mapping associating each free variable of the function (variables that are used locally, but defined in an enclosing scope) with the value or reference to which the name was bound when the closure was created.   A closure—unlike a plain function—allows the function to access those captured variables through the closure's copies of their values or references, even when the function is invoked outside their scope. 

Samwise Gamgee<====>62320<====>Samwise Gamgee Samwise "Sam" Gamgee   (later known as Samwise Gardner) Appendix C to The Lord of the Rings  is a fictional character in J.  R.  R.  Tolkien's legendarium.  Samwise is one of the main characters of The Lord of the Rings, in which he fills an archetypal role as the sidekick of the primary protagonist, Frodo Baggins.  Sam is a member of the Fellowship of the Ring, which also includes Frodo Baggins, Merry Brandybuck, Pippin Took, Legolas Greenleaf, Gimli, Boromir, Aragorn, and Gandalf.

Adamant<====>62323<====>Adamant  Adamant and similar words are used to refer to any especially hard substance, whether composed of diamond, some other gemstone, or some type of metal.   Both adamant and diamond derive from the Greek word  , ἀδάμαντος (adamas, adamantos), meaning "untameable".  Adamantite and adamantium (a metallic name derived from the Neo-Latin ending -ium) are also common variants. Adamantine has, throughout ancient history, referred to anything that was made of a very hard material.  Virgil describes Tartarus as having a screeching gate protected by columns of solid adamantine (Aeneid book VI).  Later, by the Middle Ages, the term came to refer to diamond, as it was the hardest material then known. 

Rivendell<====>62325<====>Rivendell  Rivendell is an Elven realm in Middle-earth, a fictional world created by J.  R.  R.  Tolkien.  It is an important location in Tolkien's legendarium, and is featured in The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, The Silmarillion, and Unfinished Tales.  It was established and ruled by Elrond Half-elven in the Second Age of Middle-earth (four or five thousand years before the events of The Lord of the Rings), and was protected by the powers of its lord and his elven ring Vilya. Elrond lived in Rivendell with his family—his wife Celebrían (until she departed for Valinor), their sons Elladan and Elrohir, and their daughter Arwen—as well as a sizeable number of other Elves, both Noldor and Sindar. 

Meta-analysis<====>62329<====>Meta-analysis A meta-analysis is a statistical analysis that combines the results of multiple scientific studies. The basic tenet behind meta-analyses is that there is a common truth behind all conceptually similar scientific studies, but which has been measured with a certain error within individual studies.  The aim then is to use approaches from statistics to derive a pooled estimate closest to the unknown common truth based on how this error is perceived.  In essence, all existing methods yield a weighted average from the results of the individual studies and what differs is the manner in which these weights are allocated and also the manner in which the uncertainty is computed around the point estimate thus generated. 

Adam Adamant Lives!<====>62331<====>Adam Adamant Lives!   Adam Adamant Lives! is a British television series which ran from 1966 to 1967 on the BBC, starring Gerald Harper in the title role.

CharacterThe main character originally went through a number of possible names: "Cornelius Chance", "Rupert De'Ath", "Dick Daring", "Dexter Noble", "Aurelian Winton", "Magnus Hawke" and even "Darius Crud" before Sydney Newman settled on Adam Adamant, named after the generic mineral term adamantine, which, since medieval times, has commonly referred to diamond. 

Deep sea fish<====>62332<====>Deep sea fishDeep-sea fish are fish that live in the darkness below the sunlit surface waters, that is below the epipelagic or photic zone of the sea.  The lanternfish is, by far, the most common deep-sea fish.  Other deep sea fishes include the flashlight fish, cookiecutter shark, bristlemouths, anglerfish, viperfish, and some species of eelpout. Only about 2% of known marine species inhabit the pelagic environment.  This means that they live in the water column as opposed to the benthic organisms that live in or on the sea floor.   Deep-sea organisms generally inhabit bathypelagic (1000–4000m deep) and abyssopelagic (4000–6000m deep) zones.

Permissive Action Link<====>62380<====>Permissive Action Link A Permissive Action Link (PAL) is a security device for nuclear weapons.  Its purpose is to prevent unauthorized arming or detonation of the nuclear weapon.  The United States Department of Defense definition is: The earliest PALs were little more than locks introduced into the control and firing systems of a nuclear weapon, that would inhibit either the detonation, or the removal of safety features of the weapon.  More recent innovations have included encrypted firing parameters, which must be decrypted to properly detonate the warhead, plus anti-tamper systems which intentionally mis-detonate the weapon, destroying it without giving rise to a nuclear explosion. 

Irene van Dyk<====>62381<====>Irene van Dyk   Irene van Dyk   (née Viljoen; born 21 June 1972) is a South African-born New Zealand netball player.

In 2000, she moved to Wellington, New Zealand and was quickly picked for the national team, the Silver Ferns.  This caused some minor controversy, as the only rule in netball at the time for players switching between nations was a ban on playing for more than one nation in a calendar year. 

Catalan's conjecture<====>62382<====>Catalan's conjectureFor Catalan's aliquot sequence conjecture, see aliquot sequence. Catalan's conjecture (or Mihăilescu's theorem) is a theorem in number theory that was conjectured by the mathematician Eugène Charles Catalan in 1844 and proven in 2002 by Preda Mihăilescu. 2 3  and 3 2  are two powers of natural numbers whose values (8 and 9, respectively) are consecutive.  The theorem states that this is the only case of two consecutive powers.   That is to say, that the only solution in the natural numbers of x^a - y^b = 1 for a, b > 1, x, y > 0 is x = 3, a = 2, y = 2, b = 3. 

Beatnik<====>62385<====>Beatnik Beatnik was a media stereotype prevalent throughout the 1950s to mid-1960s that displayed the more superficial aspects of the Beat Generation literary movement of the 1950s.

Eight species are native to the African continent, with the grey-headed lovebird being native to Madagascar. Social and affectionate, the name comes from the parrots' strong, monogamous pair bonding and the long periods which paired birds spend sitting together. Lovebirds live in small flocks and eat fruit, vegetables, grasses and seeds.  Black-winged lovebirds also eat insects and figs, and the black-collared lovebirds have a special dietary requirement for native figs, making them problematic to keep in captivity. 

Tarsier<====>62405<====>Tarsier Tarsiers are any haplorrhine primates of the family Tarsiidae, which is itself the lone extant family within the infraorder Tarsiiformes.  Although the group was once more widespread, all its species living today are found in the islands of Southeast Asia. Evolutionary historyFossil recordFossils of tarsiiform primates are found in Asia, Europe, and North America, with disputed fossils from Africa, but extant tarsiers are restricted to several Southeast Asian islands in the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia.

Tier 1 network<====>62426<====>Tier 1 network A Tier 1 network is an Internet Protocol (IP) network that can reach every other network on the Internet solely via settlement-free interconnection, also known as settlement-free peering.  DefinitionThere is no authority that defines tiers of networks participating in the Internet.   However, the most common and well-accepted definition of a Tier 1 network is a network that can reach every other network on the Internet without purchasing IP transit or paying for peering.   By this definition, a Tier 1 network must be a transit-free network (purchases no transit) that peers for free with every other Tier 1 network and can reach all major networks on the Internet. 

Partial evaluation<====>62428<====>Partial evaluation   In computing, partial evaluation is a technique for several different types of program optimization by specialization.  The most straightforward application is to produce new programs which run faster than the originals while being guaranteed to behave in the same way. A computer program, prog, is seen as a mapping of input data into output data: prog : I_{static} \times I_{dynamic} \to O  I_{static} , the static data, is the part of the input data known at compile time. The partial evaluator transforms  \langle prog, I_{static}\rangle  into  prog^* : I_{dynamic} \to O  by precomputing all static input at compile time. 

Eager evaluation<====>62431<====>Eager evaluation  In computer programming, eager evaluation or greedy evaluation is the evaluation strategy used by most traditional programming languages.  In eager evaluation, an expression is evaluated as soon as it is bound to a variable.   An opposite alternative to eager evaluation is lazy evaluation, where expressions are evaluated only when a dependent expression is evaluated.  Imperative programming languages, where the order of execution is implicitly defined by the structure of the source code, almost always use eager evaluation.  One advantage  of eager evaluation is that it eliminates the need  to track and schedule the evaluation of expressions. 

Pawnee people<====>62432<====>Pawnee people The Pawnee are a Plains Indian tribe who are headquartered in Pawnee, Oklahoma.  Pawnee people are enrolled in the federally recognized Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma.  Historically, they lived in Nebraska and Kansas.   In the Pawnee language, the Pawnee people refer to themselves as Chaticks si Chaticks or "Men of Men. " Historically, the Pawnee lived in large earth lodge villages with adjacent farmlands.  They used tipis when traveling.  With the arrival of horses, the Pawnee retained their agricultural lifestyle, with the tribal economic activities throughout the year alternating between farming crops and hunting buffalo. 

Evaluation<====>62433<====>Evaluation Evaluation is asystematic determination of a subject's merit, worth and significance, using criteria governed by a set of standards.  It can assist an organization, program, project or any other intervention or initiative to assess any aim, realisable concept/proposal, or any alternative, to help in decision-making; or to ascertain the degree of achievement or value in regard to the aim and objectives and results of any such action that has been completed.   The primary purpose of evaluation, in addition to gaining insight into prior or existing initiatives, is to enable reflection and assist in the identification of future change. 

SCADA<====>62437<====>SCADA   Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) is a control system architecture that uses computers, networked data communications and graphical user interfaces for high-level process supervisory management, but uses other peripheral devices such as programmable logic controllers and discrete PID controllers to interface to the process plant or machinery.  The operator interfaces which enable monitoring and the issuing of process commands, such as controller set point changes, are handled through the SCADA supervisory computer system.  However, the real-time control logic or controller calculations are performed by networked modules which connect to the field sensors and actuators. 

John Walker (runner)<====>62438<====>John Walker (runner)    Sir John George Walker,   (born 12 January 1952) is a former middle-distance runner from New Zealand who won the 1500 m event at the 1976 Olympics.  He was also the first person to run the mile in under 3:50.  In more recent years, Walker has been active in local government, as an Auckland Councillor and representing the Manurewa-Papakura ward. 1974 Commonwealth GamesWalker achieved world prominence in 1974 when he ran second to Filbert Bayi in the 1500 metre run at the Commonwealth Games in Christchurch, New Zealand.  In one of the greatest 1500 m races held to that time, Walker and Bayi both broke the existing world record, and others in the race recorded the fourth, fifth, and seventh fastest performances ever. 

The Sting<====>62440<====>The Sting   The Sting is a 1973 American caper film set in September 1936, involving a complicated plot by two professional grifters (Paul Newman and Robert Redford) to con a mob boss (Robert Shaw).   The film was directed by George Roy Hill,    who had directed Newman and Redford in the western Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.  Created by screenwriter David S.  Ward, the story was inspired by real-life cons perpetrated by brothers Fred and Charley Gondorff and documented by David Maurer in his book The Big Con: The Story of the Confidence Man. 

V5 interface<====>62444<====>V5 interfaceV5 is a family of telephone network protocols defined by ETSI which allow communications between the telephone exchange, also known in the specifications as the local exchange (LE), and the local loop.   With potentially thousands of subscribers connected to the LE there is the problem of physically managing thousands of wires out to the local subscribers (and the costs associated with that).  Prior to the specification of V5 the manufacturers of exchange equipment had proprietary solutions to the problem.  These solutions did not inter-operate and meant being tied into a single manufacturer's method at each exchange. 

230 BC<====>62445<====>230 BC   Year 230 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.  At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Barbula and Pera (or, less frequently, year 524 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 230 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)<====>62446<====>Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland) DISPLAYTITLE  Alice is a fictional character and protagonist of Lewis Carroll's children's novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) and its sequel, Through the Looking-Glass (1871).  A child in the mid-Victorian era, Alice unintentionally goes on an underground adventure after accidentally falling down a rabbit hole into Wonderland; in the sequel, she steps through a mirror into  an alternative world.  The character originated in stories told by Carroll to entertain the Liddell sisters while rowing on the Isis with his friend Robinson Duckworth, and on subsequent rowing trips.  Although she shares her given name with Alice Liddell, scholars disagree about the extent to which she was based upon Liddell.

They married first in a religious ceremony in Florence in 1840, and a second time in a secret civil ceremony on February 19, 1853 in Paris, France. 

Independence<====>62450<====>Independence Independence is a condition of a nation, country, or state in which its residents and population, or some portion thereof, exercise self-government, and usually sovereignty, over the territory.  The opposite of independence is the status of a dependent territory. Definition of independenceWhether the attainment of independence is different from revolution has long been contested, and has often been debated over the question of violence as  legitimate means to achieving sovereignty.    While some revolutions seek and achieve national independence, others aim only to redistribute power — with or without an element of emancipation, such as in democratization — within a state, which as such may remain unaltered.

Umami<====>62462<====>Umami  Umami ( ), or savory taste, is one of the five basic tastes (together with sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and saltiness).It has been described as brothy or meaty.People taste umami through taste receptors that typically respond to glutamate.  Glutamate is widely present in meat broths and fermented products, and commonly added to some foods in the form of monosodium glutamate (MSG).Since umami has its own receptors rather than arising out of a combination of the traditionally recognized taste receptors, scientists now consider umami to be a distinct taste.

TaxonomySome classification systems, for example the Cronquist system, treat the Fabaceae in a narrow sense, raising the Mimisoideae to the rank of family as Mimosaceae.   The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group treats Fabaceae in the broad sense.  The Mimosoideae were historically subdivided into four tribes (Acacieae, Ingeae, Mimoseae, and Mimozygantheae).  However, modern molecular phylogenetics have shown that these groupings were artificial.

Shannon–Fano coding<====>62544<====>Shannon–Fano codingIn the field of data compression, Shannon–Fano coding, named after Claude Shannon and Robert Fano, is a technique for constructing a prefix code based on a set of symbols and their probabilities (estimated or measured).   It is suboptimal in the sense that it does not achieve the lowest possible expected code word length like Huffman coding; however it still guarantees that all code word lengths are within one bit of their theoretical ideal  {-\log}  P(x) .   The technique was proposed in Shannon's "A Mathematical Theory of Communication", his 1948 article introducing the field of information theory. 

Arithmetic coding<====>62545<====>Arithmetic coding  Arithmetic coding is a form of entropy encoding used in lossless data compression.  Normally, a string of characters such as the words "hello there" is represented using a fixed number of bits per character, as in the ASCII code.  When a string is converted to arithmetic encoding, frequently used characters will be stored with fewer bits and not-so-frequently occurring characters will be stored with more bits, resulting in fewer bits used in total.  Arithmetic coding differs from other forms of entropy encoding, such as Huffman coding, in that rather than separating the input into component symbols and replacing each with a code, arithmetic coding encodes the entire message into a single number, an arbitrary-precision fraction q where 0. 

Pepin of Herstal<====>62546<====>Pepin of Herstal    Pepin II (c.  635 – 16 December 714), commonly known as Pepin of Herstal, was a Frankish statesman and military leader who de facto ruled Francia as the Mayor of the Palace from 680 until his death.

His father was originally a follower of the Corsican Patriot leader, Pasquale Paoli, but later became a supporter of French rule. 

Merovech<====>62558<====>MerovechMerovech (415-458) is the semi-legendary founder of the Merovingian dynasty of the Salian Franks (although either Childeric I, his supposed son, or Clovis I, his supposed grandson, may in fact be the founder), which later became the dominant Frankish tribe.  He is said to be one of several barbarian warlords and kings that joined forces with the Roman general Aetius against the Huns under Attila on the Catalaunian fields in Gaul.   The first Frankish royal dynasty called themselves Merovingians ("descendants of Meroveus") after him, although no other historical evidence exists that Merovech ever lived. NameIt has been suggested that Merovech refers to the Dutch river Merwede,  once called Merwe or Merowe. 

Theuderic I<====>62559<====>Theuderic I   Theuderic I  (c.  487 – 533/4) was the Merovingian king of Metz, Rheims, or Austrasia—as it is variously called—from 511 to 533 or 534. He was the son of Clovis I and one of his earlier wives or concubines (possibly a Franco-Rhenish Princess, Evochildis of Cologne ).   He inherited Metz in 511 at his father's death.   In accordance with Salian tradition, the kingdom was divided between Clovis's four surviving sons: Childebert I in Paris, Chlodomer in Orléans, and Clotaire I in Soissons.   Early in his reign, he sent his son Theudebert to kill the Scandinavian King Chlochilaich (Hygelac of Beowulf fame) who had invaded his realm. 

Lucien Bonaparte<====>62560<====>Lucien Bonaparte   Lucien Bonaparte, Prince Français, 1st Prince of Canino and Musignano (born Luciano Buonaparte; 21 May 1775 – 29 June 1840), was a French statesman, the third surviving son of Carlo Bonaparte and his wife Letizia Ramolino. Lucien was a younger brother of Joseph and Napoleon Bonaparte, and an older brother of Elisa, Louis, Pauline, Caroline and Jérôme Bonaparte.

Comparison of butterflies and moths<====>62591<====>Comparison of butterflies and mothsA common classification of the Lepidoptera involves their differentiation into butterflies and moths.   Butterflies are a natural monophyletic group, often given the suborder Rhopalocera, which includes Papilionoidea (true butterflies), Hesperiidae (skippers), and Hedylidae (butterfly moths).  In this taxonomic scheme moths belong to the suborder Heterocera.  Other taxonomic schemes have been proposed; the most common putting the butterflies into the suborder Ditrysia and then the "superfamily" Papilionoidea, and ignoring a classification for moths.  However none of the taxonomic schemes are perfect, and taxonomists commonly argue over how to define the obvious differences between butterflies and moths.

Event-driven programming<====>62599<====>Event-driven programming  In computer programming, event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs, or messages from other programs/threads.  Event-driven programming is the dominant paradigm used in graphical user interfaces and other applications (e. g.  JavaScript web applications) that are centered on performing certain actions in response to user input.  This is also true of programming for device drivers (e. g.  P in USB device driver stacks )In an event-driven application, there is generally a main loop that listens for events, and then triggers a callback function when one of those events is detected.

Domain (biology)<====>62603<====>Domain (biology)    In biological taxonomy, a domain (Latin: regio ), also superkingdom or empire,  is the highest taxonomic rank of organisms in the three-domain system of taxonomy designed by Carl Woese, an American microbiologist and biophysicist.  According to the Woese system, introduced in 1990, the tree of life consists of three domains: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya.The first two are all prokaryotic microorganisms, or single-celled organisms whose cells have no nucleus.  All life that has a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, and multicellular organisms, is included in the Eukarya.  Stefan Luketa in 2012 proposed a five "dominion" system, adding two more to the above. 

338 BC<====>62609<====>338 BC    Year 338 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.

The denomination 338 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. Events By placePersian EmpireThe Persian general and vizier, the eunuch Bagoas, falls out of favour with King Artaxerxes III.  Bagoas seeks to remain in office by replacing Artaxerxes with his youngest son Arses, whom he thinks will be easier to control. 

Polyploid<====>62610<====>Polyploid Polyploid cells and organisms are those containing more than two paired (homologous) sets of chromosomes.  Most species whose cells have nuclei (Eukaryotes) are diploid, meaning they have two sets of chromosomes—one set inherited from each parent.  However, polyploidy is found in some organisms and is especially common in plants.  In addition, polyploidy occurs in some tissues of animals that are otherwise diploid, such as human muscle tissues.This is known as endopolyploidy.  Species whose cells do not have nuclei, that is, Prokaryotes, may be polyploid organisms, as seen in the large bacterium Epulopiscium fishelsoni [1].

Defensive programming<====>62661<====>Defensive programming Defensive programming is a form of defensive design intended to ensure the continuing function of a piece of software under unforeseen circumstances.  Defensive programming practices are often used where high availability, safety or security is needed. Defensive programming is an approach to improve software and source code, in terms of:General quality – reducing the number of software bugs and problems. Making the source code comprehensible – the source code should be readable and understandable so it is approved in a code audit. Making the software behave in a predictable manner despite unexpected inputs or user actions. Overly defensive programming however introduces unnecessary code for errors impossible to even happen, thus wasting runtime and maintenance costs.

Napoléon, Prince Imperial<====>62678<====>Napoléon, Prince ImperialNapoléon, Prince Imperial (full name: Napoléon Eugène Louis Jean Joseph Bonaparte, prince impérial de France; 16 March 1856 – 1 June 1879) was the only child of Emperor Napoleon III of France and his Empress consort Eugénie de Montijo.  After his father was dethroned in 1870, he relocated with his family to England.  On his father's death in January 1873, he was proclaimed Napoleon IV, Emperor of the French by the Bonapartist faction. In England he trained as a soldier.  Keen to see action, he successfully put pressure on the British to allow him to participate in the Anglo-Zulu War. 

Eugénie de Montijo<====>62679<====>Eugénie de Montijo  Doña María Eugenia Ignacia Augustina de Palafox y KirkPatrick, 16th Countess of Teba, 15th Marchioness of Ardales (5 May 1826 – 11 July 1920), known as Eugénie de Montijo ( ), was the last Empress consort of the French, from 1853 to 1871, as the wife of Napoleon III, Emperor of the French.YouthThe last Empress of the French was born in Granada, Spain, to Don Cipriano de Palafox y Portocarrero (1785–1839), Grandee, whose titles included  8th Count of Ablitas, 9th Count of Montijo, 15th Count of Teba, 8th Count of Fuentidueña, 14th Marquess of Ardales, 17th Marquess of Moya and 13th Marquess of la Algaba  and his half-Scottish, quarter-Belgian, quarter-Spanish wife (whom he married on 15 December 1817), María Manuela Enriqueta Kirkpatrick de Closbourn y de Grevigné (24 February 1794 – 22 November 1879), a daughter of the Scots-born William Kirkpatrick of Closbourn (1764–1837), who became United States consul to Málaga, and later was a wholesale wine merchant, and his wife, Marie Françoise de Grevignée (born 1769), daughter of Liège-born Henri, Baron de Grevignée and wife Doña Francisca Antonia Gallegos (1751–1853).Eugenia's older sister, María Francisca de Sales de Palafox Portocarrero y Kirkpatrick, nicknamed "Paca" (24 January 1825 – 16 September 1860), who inherited most of the family honours and was 12th Duchess of Peñaranda Grandee of Spain and 9th Countess of Montijo, title later ceded to her sister, married the Duke of Alba in 1849. Until her own marriage in 1853, Eugénie variously used the titles of Countess of Teba or Countess of Montijo, but some family titles were legally inherited by her elder sister, through which they passed to the House of Alba. After the death of her father, Eugenia became the 9th Countess of Teba, and is named as such in the Almanach de Gotha (1901 edition). After Eugenia's demise all titles of the Montijo family came to the Fitz-Jameses (the Dukes of Alba and Berwick).On 18 July 1834, María Manuela and her daughters left Madrid for Paris, fleeing a cholera outbreak and the dangers of the First Carlist War. The previous day, Eugenia had witnessed a riot and murder in the square outside their residence, Casa Ariza. Eugénie de Montijo, as she became known in France, was formally educated mostly in Paris, beginning at the fashionable, traditionalist Convent of the Sacré Cœur from 1835 to 1836. A more compatible school was the progressive Gymnase Normal, Civil et Orthosomatique, from 1836 to 1837, which appealed to her athletic side (a school report praised her strong liking for athletic exercise, and although an indifferent student, that her character was "good, generous, active and firm").  In 1837, Eugénie and Paca briefly attended a boarding school for girls on Royal York Crescent in Clifton, Bristol,  to learn English. Eugénie was teased as "Carrots", for her red hair, and tried to run away to India, making it as far as climbing on board a ship in Bristol docks. In August 1837 they returned to school in Paris.  However, much of the girls' education took place at home, under the tutelage of English governesses Miss Cole and Miss Flowers,  and family friends such as Prosper Mérimée  and Henri Beyle. In March 1839, on the death of their father in Madrid, the girls left Paris to rejoin their mother there.  In Spain, Eugénie grew up into a headstrong and physically daring young woman, devoted to horseriding and a range of other sports.  She was rescued from drowning, and twice attempted suicide after romantic disappointments.  She was very interested in politics, and became devoted to the Bonapartist cause, under the influence of Eleanore Gordon, a former mistress of Louis Napoléon.  Thanks to her mother's role as a lavish society hostess, Eugénie became acquainted with Isabel II and the prime minister Ramón Narváez. María Manuela was increasingly anxious to find a husband for her daughter, and took her on trips to Paris again in 1849 and England in 1851. EmpressMarriageShe first met Prince Louis Napoléon after he had become president of the Second Republic, with her mother, at a reception given by the "prince-president" at the Elysée Palace on April 12, 1849.  Her beauty attracted Louis Napoleon, who, as was his custom, tried to seduce her, but Eugénie told him to wait for marriage.  "What is the road to your heart?" Napoleon demanded to know. "Through the chapel, Sire", she answered.In a speech on 22 January 1853, Napoleon III, after having become emperor, formally announced his engagement, saying, "I have preferred a woman whom I love and respect to a woman unknown to me, with whom an alliance would have had advantages mixed with sacrifices".  They were wed, on 29 January 1853, in a civil ceremony at the Tuileries, and on the 30th there was a much grander religious ceremony at Notre Dame. The marriage had come after considerable activity with regard to who would make a suitable match, often toward titled royals and with an eye to foreign policy. The final choice was opposed in many quarters and Eugénie considered of too little social standing by some.   In the United Kingdom The Times made light of the latter concern, emphasizing that the parvenu Bonapartes were at least marrying into established Spanish nobility: "We learn with some amusement that this romantic event in the annals of the French Empire has called forth the strongest opposition, and provoked the utmost irritation. The Imperial family, the Council of Ministers, and even the lower coteries of the palace or its purlieus, all affect to regard this marriage as an amazing humiliation..."  Eugénie found childbearing extraordinarily difficult. An initial miscarriage in 1853, after a three-month pregnancy, frightened and soured her.  On 16 March 1856, after a two-day labor that endangered mother and child and from which Eugénie made a very slow recovery, the empress gave birth to an only son, Napoléon Eugène Louis Jean Joseph Bonaparte, styled Prince Impérial.  After marriage, it took not long for her husband to stray as Eugénie found sex with him "disgusting".  It is doubtful that she allowed further approaches by her husband once she had given him an heir.  He subsequently resumed his "petites distractions" with other women.Public lifeEugénie faithfully performed the duties of an Empress, entertaining guests and accompanying the Emperor to balls, opera, and theater. After her marriage, she was given a ladies-in-waiting consisting of six (later twelve) dame du palais, most of whom were chosen from among the acquaintances to the empress prior to her marriage, headed by the Grand-Maitresse Anne Debelle, Princesse d'Essling, and the dame d'honneur, Pauline de Bassano. She traveled to Egypt to open the Suez Canal and officially represented him whenever he traveled outside France. She strongly advocated equality for women; she pressured the Ministry of National Education to give the first baccalaureate diploma to a woman and tried unsuccessfully to induce the Académie française to elect the writer George Sand as its first female member. Her husband often consulted her on important questions, and she acted as regent during his absences in 1859, 1865 and 1870. In 1860, she visited Algiers with Napoleon.    A Catholic and a conservative, her influence countered any liberal tendencies in the emperor's policies.She was a staunch defender of papal temporal powers in Italy and of ultramontanism. She was blamed for the fiasco of the French intervention in Mexico and the eventual death of Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico. Maximilian and Carlota by Gene Smith,  ,    However, the assertion of her clericalism and influence on the side of conservatism is often countered by other authors.  In 1868, Empress Eugénie visited the Dolmabahçe Palace in Constantinople, the home to Sultana Pertevniyal Sultan, mother of Abdülaziz, 32nd sultan of the Ottoman Empire. Pertevniyal became outraged by the forwardness of Eugénie taking the arm of one of her sons while he gave a tour of the palace garden, and she gave the Empress a slap on the stomach as a possibly more subtly intended than often represented reminder that they were not in France.  According to another account, Pertevniyal perceived the presence of a foreign woman within her quarters of the seraglio as an insult. She reportedly slapped Eugénie across the face, almost resulting in an international incident. BiarritzIn 1854, the emperor Napoleon III and Eugénie bought several acres of dunes in Biarritz and gave the engineer Dagueret the task of establishing a summer home surrounded by gardens, woods, meadows, a pond and outbuildings.   Napoleon III chose the location near Spain so his wife would not get homesick for her native country.  The house was called Villa Eugénie, today the Hôtel du Palais.  The presence of the imperial couple attracted other European royalty like the British monarchs Queen Victoria and the Spanish king Alfonso XIII and made Biarritz well-known.Role in Franco-Prussian WarAfter the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, Eugenie remained in Paris as Regent while Napoleon III and the Prince Imperial travelled to join the troops at the German front. When the news of several French defeats reached Paris on 7 August, it was greeted with disbelief and dismay. Prime Minister Émile Ollivier and the chief of staff of the army, Marshal Leboeuf both resigned and Eugenie took it upon herself to name a new government. She chose General Cousin-Montauban, better known as the Count of Palikao, seventy-four years old, as her new prime minister. The Count of Palikao named Maréchal Francois Achille Bazaine, the commander of the French forces in Lorraine, as the new overall military commander. Napoleon III proposed returning to Paris, realizing that he was doing no good for the army. The Empress responded by telegraph, "Don't think of coming back, unless you want to unleash a terrible revolution. They will say you quit the army to flee the danger." The Emperor agreed to remain with the army.  With the Empress directing the country, and Bazaine commanding the army, the Emperor no longer had any real role to play. At the front, the Emperor told Marshal Leboeuf, "we've both been dismissed." The army was ultimately defeated and Napoleon III gave himself up to the Prussians at the Battle of Sedan. The news of the capitulation reached Paris on 3 September, and when it was given to the Empress that the Emperor and the army were prisoners, she reacted by shouting at the Emperor's personal aide, "No! An Emperor does not capitulate! He is dead!...They are trying to hide it from me. Why didn't he kill himself! Doesn't he know he has dishonored himself?!".  Later, when hostile crowds formed near the Tuileries palace, and the staff began to flee, the Empress slipped out with one of her entourage and sought sanctuary with her American dentist, who took her to Deauville. From there, on 7 September, she took the yacht of a British official to England. In the meantime, on 4 September, a group of republican deputies proclaimed the return of the Republic, and the creation of a Government of National Defense. From 5 September 1870 until 19 March 1871, Napoleon III and his entourage were held in comfortable captivity in a castle at Wilhelmshöhe, near Kassel. Eugénie  traveled incognito to Germany to visit Napoleon. After the Franco-Prussian WarWhen the Second Empire was overthrown after France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, the empress and her husband took permanent refuge in England, and settled at Chislehurst, Kent. After his death in 1873, and that of her son in 1879, she moved in 1885 to Farnborough, Hampshire and to the Villa Cyrnos (named after the ancient Greek for Corsica), which was built for her at Cape Martin, between Menton and Nice, where she lived in retirement, abstaining from politics. Her house in Farnborough is now an independent Roman Catholic girls' school, Farnborough Hill. After the deaths of her husband and son, as her health started to deteriorate, she spent some time at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight; her physician recommended she visit Bournemouth which was, in Victorian times, famed as a health spa resort. During her afternoon visit in 1881, she called on the Queen of Sweden, at her residence 'Crag Head'. Her deposed family's friendly association with the United Kingdom was commemorated in 1887 when she became the godmother of Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg (1887–1969), daughter of Princess Beatrice, who later became Queen consort of Alfonso XIII of Spain. She was also close to Empress Alexandra Feodorovna of Russia, who last visited her, along with Tsar Nicholas II, in 1909.On the outbreak of World War I, she donated her steam yacht Thistle to the British Navy. She funded a military hospital at Farnborough Hill as well as making large donations to French hospitals. In 1919 she was awarded an honorary Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE), for her wartime contribution. The former empress died in July 1920, aged 94, during a visit to her relative the Duke of Alba, at the Liria Palace in Madrid in her native Spain, and she is interred in the Imperial Crypt at St Michael's Abbey, Farnborough, with her husband and her son, who had died in 1879 fighting in the Zulu War in South Africa.Eugenie lived long enough to see the collapse of other European monarchies after World War I, such as those of Russia, Germany and Austria-Hungary. She left her possessions to various relatives: her Spanish estates went to the grandsons of her sister, the Fitz-Jameses (Dukes of Berwick and Alba), the house in Farnborough with all collections to the heir of her son, Prince Victor Bonaparte, Villa Cyrnos to his sister, Princess Laetitia of Aosta. Liquid assets were divided into three parts and given to the above relatives, except the sum of 100,000 francs bequeathed to the Committee for Rebuilding the Cathedral of Reims. LegacyThe Empress has also been commemorated in space; the asteroid 45 Eugenia was named after her,  and its moon, Petit-Prince, after the Prince Imperial. She had an extensive and unique jewelry collection,  most of which was later owned by the Brazilian socialite Aimée de Heeren.   De Heeren collected jewelry and was fond of the Empress as both were considered to be the "Queens of Biarritz"; both would spend summers on the Côte Basque. Impressed by the elegance, style and design of the jewelry of the neo classical era, in 1858 she had a boutique in the Royal Palace under the name ‘Royale Collections’. She was honoured by John Gould who gave the white-headed fruit dove the scientific name Ptilinopus eugeniae.In popular cultureNamed for the Empress, the Eugénie hat is a style of women's chapeau worn dramatically tilted and drooped over one eye; its brim is folded up sharply at both sides in the style of a riding topper, often with one long ostrich plume streaming behind it.    The hat was popularized by film star Greta Garbo and enjoyed a vogue in the early 1930s, becoming "hysterically popular".  More representative of the Empress' actual apparel, however, was the late nineteenth-century fashion of the Eugénie paletot, a women's greatcoat with bell sleeves and a single button enclosure at the neck. In the 1939 film Juarez, Eugenie was portrayed by Gale Sondergaard as a ruthless monarch, glad to help her husband in his scheme to control Mexico.Titles from birth to death5 May 1826 -  15 March 1839: Doña María Eugenia Palafox de Guzmán Portocarreo y Kirkpatrick15 March 1839 - 29 January 1853: Her Excellency The Countess of Teba29 January 1853 - 4 September 1870: Her Imperial Majesty The Empress of the French4 September 1870 - 11 July 1920: Her Imperial Majesty Empress Eugénie of France, Countess of TebaNote: Empress Eugénie held the title of Countess of Teba from her father's death on 15 March 1839 until her death, when the title passed to the family of her sister Paca, the House of Alba.Honours475th Dame of the Royal Order of Queen María Luisa of SpainHonorary Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British EmpireGrand Cross of the Order of Saint Charles (Mexico)Ancestry    Film portrayalsIn Suez (1938): Loretta Young plays her as the love interest of Ferdinand de Lesseps.In Juarez (1939): Played by Gale Sondergaard, where she joins her husband in setting Austrian Archduke Maximilian on the throne of Mexico, and then abandoning him.In Violetas Imperiales (1932, 1952): Set in Granada, 19th century Spain, Eugénie de Montijo (played by Simone Valère) asks a gypsy girl, Violetta (played by Carmen Sevilla), to read her fortune in her hand.

Fossilized stromatolites provide ancient records of life on Earth by these remains, some of which may date from 3. 7 billion years ago.    Lichen stromatolites are a proposed mechanism of formation of some kinds of layered rock structure that are formed above water, where rock meets air, by repeated colonization of the rock by endolithic lichens.

Guinea pig<====>62696<====>Guinea pigThe domestic guinea pig or simply guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), also known as cavy, is a species of rodent belonging to the family Caviidae and the genus Cavia.  Despite their common name, these animals are not in the pig family Suidae, nor do they come from Guinea in Africa.  They originated in the Andes of South America; studies based on biochemistry and hybridization suggest they are domestic descendants of a closely related species of cavy such as C.  tschudii, and therefore do not exist naturally in the wild.The domestic guinea pig plays an important role in the folk culture of many indigenous South American groups, especially as a food source, but also in folk medicine and in community religious ceremonies.

It ranges from   at its narrowest to   at its widest point and has approximately   of coastline and approximately 65 islands.  The total area of the Baja California Peninsula is  . The peninsula is separated from  mainland  Mexico by the Gulf of California and the Colorado River. 

Autogyro<====>62709<====>AutogyroAn autogyro (from Greek αὐτός + γύρος, self-turning), also known as gyroplane, gyrocopter, or rotaplane, is a type of rotorcraft that uses an unpowered rotor in autorotation to develop lift, and an engine-powered propeller, similar to that of a fixed-wing aircraft, to provide thrust.  While similar to a helicopter rotor in appearance, the autogyro's rotor must have air flowing through the rotor disc to generate rotation.  Invented by the Spanish engineer Juan de la Cierva to create an aircraft that could fly safely at low speeds, the autogyro was first flown on 9 January 1923, at Cuatro Vientos Airfield in Madrid. 

Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution<====>62710<====>Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution  is a clause in the national Constitution of Japan outlawing war as a means to settle international disputes involving the state.  The Constitution came into effect on May 3, 1947, following World War II.  In its text, the state formally renounces the sovereign right of belligerency and aims at an international peace based on justice and order.  The article also states that, to accomplish these aims, armed forces with war potential will not be maintained. However, Japan maintains de facto armed forces, referred to as the Japan Self-Defense Forces, which may have originally been thought of as something akin to what Mahatma Gandhi called the Shanti Sena (soldiers of peace) or a collective security police (peacekeeping) force operating under the United Nations. 

First Anglo-Dutch War<====>62713<====>First Anglo-Dutch WarDates in this article are given in the Gregorian calendar, then ten days ahead of the Julian calendar in use in England.    The First Anglo-Dutch War, or, simply, the First Dutch War, (  "First English War") (1652–54) was a conflict fought entirely at sea between the navies of the Commonwealth of England and the United Provinces of the Netherlands.  Caused by disputes over trade, the war began with English attacks on Dutch merchant shipping, but expanded to vast fleet actions.  Ultimately, it resulted in the English Navy gaining control of the seas around England, and forced the Dutch to accept an English monopoly on trade with England and her colonies.

Maarten Tromp<====>62717<====>Maarten Tromp   Maarten Harpertszoon Tromp (23 April 1598 – 10 August 1653) was an officer and later admiral in the Dutch navy.  His first name is also spelled Maerten. Early lifeBorn in Brill, Tromp was the oldest son of Harpert Maertensz, a naval officer and captain of the frigate Olifantstromp ("Elephant Trunk").  The surname Tromp probably derives from the name of the ship; it first appeared in documents in 1607.  His mother supplemented the family's income as a washerwoman.  At the age of nine, Tromp went to sea with his father, and he was present in a squadron covering the Dutch main fleet fighting the Battle of Gibraltar in 1607. 

Line-item veto in the United States<====>62719<====>Line-item veto in the United StatesIn United States government, the line-item veto, or partial veto, is the power of an executive authority to nullify or cancel specific provisions of a bill, usually a budget appropriations bill, without vetoing the entire legislative package.  The line-item vetoes are usually subject to the possibility of legislative override as are traditional vetoes. GovernorsForty-four states—with Indiana, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and Vermont as the only states that do not grant such powers—give their governors some form of line-item veto power.   The Mayor of Washington, D. C.  also has this power. 

Reverse Address Resolution Protocol<====>62720<====>Reverse Address Resolution Protocol The Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) is an obsolete computer networking protocol used by a client computer to request its Internet Protocol (IPv4) address from a computer network, when all it has available is its link layer or hardware address, such as a MAC address.  The client broadcasts the request, and does not need prior knowledge of the network topology or the identities of servers capable of fulfilling its request. RARP is described in Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) publication RFC 903.    It has been rendered obsolete by the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) and the modern Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), which both support a much greater feature set than RARP. 

Alta California<====>62723<====>Alta California  Alta California ( ), founded in 1769 by Gaspar de Portolà, was a polity of New Spain, and, after the Mexican War of Independence in 1822, a territory of Mexico.  The region included all of the modern American states of California, Nevada, and Utah, and parts of Arizona, Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico. Neither Spain nor Mexico ever colonized the area beyond the southern and central coastal area of present-day California, so they never exerted any effective control north of the Sonoma area, or east of the California Coast Ranges.  Most interior areas such as the Central Valley and the deserts of California remained in de facto possession of indigenous peoples until later in the Mexican era when more inland land grants were made, and especially after 1841 when overland immigrants from the United States began to settle inland areas. 

Wilhelm Ackermann<====>62727<====>Wilhelm Ackermann   Wilhelm Friedrich Ackermann (29 March 1896 – 24 December 1962) was a German mathematician best known for the Ackermann function, an important example in the theory of computation. Ackermann was born in Herscheid municipality, Germany, and was awarded a Ph. D.  by the University of Göttingen in 1925 for his thesis Begründung des "tertium non datur" mittels der Hilbertschen Theorie der Widerspruchsfreiheit, which was a consistency proof of arithmetic apparently without full Peano induction (although it did use e. g.  induction over the length of proofs).  From 1929 until 1948, he taught at the Arnoldinum Gymnasium in Burgsteinfurt, and then at Lüdenscheid until 1961.

His most famous accomplishment was the invention in 1920 of the Autogiro, Aero Digest, Feb 1939, page 27  a single-rotor type of aircraft that came to be called autogyro in the English language.  In 1923, after four years of experimentation, De la Cierva developed the articulated rotor, which resulted in the world's first successful flight of a stable rotary-wing aircraft, with his C. 

Sense of balance<====>62729<====>Sense of balanceSense of balance or equilibrioception is one of the physiological senses related to balance.  It helps prevent humans and animals from falling over when standing or moving.  Balance is the result of a number of body systems working together: the eyes (visual system), ears (vestibular system) and the body's sense of where it is in space (proprioception) ideally need to be intact.  The vestibular system, the region of the inner ear where three semicircular canals converge, works with the visual system to keep objects in focus when the head is moving.  This is called the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). 

Finger protocol<====>62737<====>Finger protocol In computer networking, the Name/Finger protocol and the Finger user information protocol are simple network protocols for the exchange of human-oriented status and user information. Name/Finger protocolThe Name/Finger protocol, is based on Request for Comments document   (December 1977) as an interface to the  name  and  finger  programs that provide status reports on a particular computer system or a particular person at network sites.  The finger program was written in 1971 by Les Earnest who created the program to solve the need of users who wanted information on other users of the network.

Lethal injection<====>62745<====>Lethal injection    Lethal injection is the practice of injecting one or more drugs into a person (typically a barbiturate, paralytic, and potassium solution) for the express purpose of causing immediate death.  The main application for this procedure is capital punishment, but the term may also be applied in a broader sense to include euthanasia and suicide.  The drugs cause the person to become unconscious, stops their breathing, and causes a heart arrythmia, in that order. Typically, three drugs are used in lethal injection.  An anesthetic such as sodium thiopental or pentobarbital is used to induce unconsciousness, pancuronium bromide (Pavulon) to cause muscle paralysis and respiratory arrest, and potassium chloride to stop the heart.

Anacamptis pyramidalis<====>62772<====>Anacamptis pyramidalis Anacamptis pyramidalis, the pyramidal orchid,    is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the genus Anacamptis of the family Orchidaceae.  The scientific name Anacamptis derives from Greek ανακάμτειν 'anakamptein' meaning 'bend forward', while the Latin name pyramidalis refers to the pyramidal form of the inflorescence. DescriptionThis hardy plant reaches on average   of height, with a maximum of  .  The stem is erect and unbranched.  The basal leaves are linear-lanceolate with parallel venation, up to   long, the cauline ones are shorter and barely visible on the stem.  The arrangement of hermaphroditic flowers in a compact pyramidal shape is very distinctive and gives the orchid its common name. 

Gymnadenia conopsea<====>62773<====>Gymnadenia conopsea   Gymnadenia conopsea, commonly known as the fragrant orchid or marsh fragrant orchid, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the family Orchidaceae native to northern Europe. EtymologyThe name of the genus Gymnadenia is formed from Greek words   ( , "nude") and   ( , "gland") and refers to the characteristics of the organs for secreting nectar.  The specific Latin name "conopsea" derives from the Greek   ( ), literally meaning "mosquito-like", probably because of the similarity of the long spur of the flower with the mouthparts of a mosquito. The scientific binomial name of this plant was initially Orchis conopsea, proposed by the Swedish naturalist and botanist Carl von Linné (1707–1778) in his   of 1753. 

Pre-abelian category<====>62775<====>Pre-abelian categoryIn mathematics, specifically in category theory, a pre-abelian category is an additive category that has all kernels and cokernels.Spelled out in more detail, this means that a category C is pre-abelian if:C is preadditive, that is enriched over the monoidal category of abelian groups (equivalently, all hom-sets in C are Abelian groups and composition of morphisms is bilinear);C has all finite products (equivalently, all finite coproducts); note that because C is also preadditive, finite products are the same as finite coproducts, making them biproducts;given any morphism f: A → B in C, the equaliser of f and the zero morphism from A to B exists (this is by definition the kernel of f), as does the coequaliser (this is by definition the cokernel of f).Note that the zero morphism in item 3 can be identified as the identity element of the hom-set Hom(A,B), which is an abelian group by item 1; or as the unique morphism A → O → B, where O is a zero object, guaranteed to exist by item 2.ExamplesThe original example of an additive category is the category Ab of abelian groups.Ab is preadditive because it is a closed monoidal category, the biproduct in Ab is the finite direct sum, the kernel is inclusion of the ordinary kernel from group theory and the cokernel is the quotient map onto the ordinary cokernel from group theory.Other common examples:The category of (left) modules over a ring R, in particular:the category of vector spaces over a field K.The category of (Hausdorff) abelian topological groups.The category of Banach spaces.The category of Fréchet spaces.The category of (Hausdorff) bornological spaces.These will give you an idea of what to think of; for more examples, see abelian category (every abelian category is pre-abelian).Elementary propertiesEvery pre-abelian category is of course an additive category, and many basic properties of these categories are described under that subject.This article concerns itself with the properties that exist specifically because of the existence of kernels and cokernels.Although kernels and cokernels are special kinds of equalisers and coequalisers, a pre-abelian category actually has all equalisers and coequalisers.We simply construct the equaliser of two morphisms f and g as the kernel of their difference g − f; similarly, their coequaliser is the cokernel of their difference.(The alternative term "difference kernel" for binary equalisers derives from this fact.)Since pre-abelian categories have all finite products and coproducts (the biproducts) and all binary equalisers and coequalisers (as just described), then by a general theorem of category theory, they have all finite limits and colimits.That is, pre-abelian categories are finitely complete.The existence of both kernels and cokernels gives a notion of image and coimage.We can define these asim f := ker coker f;coim f := coker ker f.That is, the image is the kernel of the cokernel, and the coimage is the cokernel of the kernel.Note that this notion of image may not correspond to the usual notion of image, or range, of a function, even assuming that the morphisms in the category are functions.For example, in the category of topological abelian groups, the image of a morphism actually corresponds to the inclusion of the closure of the range of the function.For this reason, people will often distinguish the meanings of the two terms in this context, using "image" for the abstract categorical concept and "range" for the elementary function-theoretic concept.In many common situations, such as the category of sets, where images and coimages exist, their objects are isomorphic.Put more precisely, we have a factorisation of f: A → B asA → C → I → B,where the morphism on the left is the coimage, the morphism on the right is the image, and the morphism in the middle (called the parallel of f) is an isomorphism.In a pre-abelian category, this is not necessarily true.The factorisation shown above does always exist, but the parallel might not be an isomorphism.In fact, the parallel of f is an isomorphism for every morphism f if and only if the pre-abelian category is an abelian category.An example of a non-abelian, pre-abelian category is, once again, the category of topological abelian groups.As remarked, the image is the inclusion of the closure of the range; however, the coimage is a quotient map onto the range itself.Thus, the parallel is the inclusion of the range into its closure, which is not an isomorphism unless the range was already closed.Exact functorsRecall that all finite limits and colimits exist in a pre-abelian category.In general category theory, a functor is called left exact if it preserves all finite limits and right exact if it preserves all finite colimits. (A functor is simply exact if it's both left exact and right exact.)In a pre-abelian category, exact functors can be described in particularly simple terms.First, recall that an additive functor is a functor F: C → D between preadditive categories that acts as a group homomorphism on each hom-set.Then it turns out that a functor between pre-abelian categories is left exact if and only if it is additive and preserves all kernels, and it's right exact if and only if it's additive and preserves all cokernels.Note that an exact functor, because it preserves both kernels and cokernels, preserves all images and coimages.Exact functors are most useful in the study of abelian categories, where they can be applied to exact sequences.Maximal exact structureOn every pre-abelian category  \mathcal A  there exists an exact structure  \mathcal{E}_{\text{max}}  which is maximal in the sense that it contains every other exact structure. The exact structure  \mathcal{E}_{\text{max}}  consists of precisely those kernel-cokernel pairs  (f,g)  where  f  is a semi-stable kernel and  \mathcal g  is a semi-stable cokernel.  Here,  f:X\rightarrow Y  is a semi-stable kernel if it is a kernel and for each morphism  h:X\rightarrow Z  in the pushout diagram  \begin{array}{ccc} X & \xrightarrow{f} & Y \\\downarrow_{h} &  & \downarrow_{h'}\\Z & \xrightarrow{f'} & Q\end{array}  the morphism  f'  is again a kernel.  g: X\rightarrow Y  is a semi-stable cokernel if it is a cokernel and for every morphism  h: Z\rightarrow Y  in the pullback diagram  \begin{array}{ccc} P & \xrightarrow{g'} & Z \\\downarrow_{h'} &  & \downarrow_{h}\\X & \xrightarrow{g} & Y\end{array}  the morphism  g'  is again a cokernel.A pre-abelian category  \mathcal A  is quasi-abelian if and only if all kernel-cokernel pairs form an exact structure. An example for which this is not the case is the category of (Hausdorff) bornological spaces. The result is also valid for additive categories which are not pre-abelian but Karoubian. Special casesAn abelian category is a pre-abelian category such that every monomorphism and epimorphism is normal.A quasi-abelian category is a pre-abelian category in which kernels are stable under pushouts and cokernels are stable under pullbacks.A semi-abelian category is a pre-abelian category in which for each morphism  f  the induced morphism  \overline{f}:\operatorname{coim}f\rightarrow\operatorname{im}f  is always a monomorphism and an epimorphism.The pre-abelian categories most commonly studied are in fact abelian categories; for example, Ab is an abelian category. Pre-abelian categories which are not abelian appear for instance in functional analysis.Citations ReferencesNicolae Popescu; 1973;  Abelian Categories with Applications to Rings and Modules ; Academic Press, Inc.; out of printDennis Sieg and Sven-Ake Wegner, Maximal exact structures on additive categories, Math.

Henry Benedict Stuart<====>62777<====>Henry Benedict Stuart Henry Benedict Thomas Edward Maria Clement Francis Xavier Stuart, Cardinal Duke of York (6 March 1725 – 13 July 1807) was a Roman Catholic Cardinal, as well as the fourth and final Jacobite heir to claim the thrones of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland publicly.  Unlike his father, James Francis Edward Stuart, and brother, Charles Edward Stuart, Henry made no effort to seize the throne.  After Charles's death in January 1788 the Papacy did not recognise Henry as the lawful ruler of England, Scotland, and Ireland, but referred to him as the Cardinal Duke of York. 

Austrasia<====>62778<====>Austrasia   Austrasia was a territory which formed the northeastern section of the Merovingian Kingdom of the Franks during the 6th to 8th centuries.  It was centred on the Meuse, Middle Rhine and the Moselle rivers, and was the original territory of the Franks, including both the so-called Salians and Rhineland Franks, which Clovis I conquered after first taking control of the bordering part of Roman Gaul, now northern France, which is sometimes described in this period as Neustria.  In AD 567, Austrasia became a separate kingdom within the Frankish kingdom and was ruled by Sigebert I. 

Complete category<====>62781<====>Complete categoryIn mathematics, a complete category is a category in which all small limits exist.  That is, a category C is complete if every diagram F : J → C where J is small has a limit in C.  Dually, a cocomplete category is one in which all small colimits exist.  A bicomplete category is a category which is both complete and cocomplete. The existence of all limits (even when J is a proper class) is too strong to be practically relevant.  Any category with this property is necessarily a thin category: for any two objects there can be at most one morphism from one object to the other. 

Soybean<====>62784<====>SoybeanGlycine max, commonly known as soybean in North America or soya bean,  is a species of legume native to East Asia, widely grown for its edible bean which has numerous uses. Fat-free (defatted) soybean meal is a significant and cheap source of protein for animal feeds and many packaged meals.  For example, soybean products, such as textured vegetable protein (TVP), are ingredients in many meat and dairy substitutes.The beans contain significant amounts of phytic acid, dietary minerals and B vitamins.  Soy vegetable oil, used in food and industrial applications, is another product of processing the soybean crop. 

Edamame<====>62785<====>Edamame   Edamame  , or edamame bean, is a preparation of immature soybeans in the pod, found in cuisines with origins from East Asia.   The pods are boiled or steamed and served with salt.  In Japan, it is usually blanched in 4% salt water and not served with salt.   When the beans are outside the pod, the term mukimame is sometimes used.  NameThe Japanese name, edamame, is used commonly to refer to the dish.  It literally means, "stem bean" (枝 eda = "branch" or "stem" + 豆 mame = "bean"), because the beans were often sold while still attached to the stem.

Soul music<====>62808<====>Soul music   Soul music (often referred to simply as soul) is a popular music genre that originated in the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  It combines elements of African-American gospel music, rhythm and blues and jazz.  Soul music became popular for dancing and listening in the United States, where record labels such as Motown, Atlantic and Stax were influential during the Civil Rights Movement.  Soul also became popular around the world, directly influencing rock music and the music of Africa.    According to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, soul is "music that arose out of the black experience in America through the transmutation of gospel and rhythm & blues into a form of funky, secular testifying". 

Warren Beatty<====>62809<====>Warren Beatty  Henry Warren Beatty  (né Beaty; born March 30, 1937) is an American actor and filmmaker.  He has been nominated for fourteen Academy Awards – four for Best Actor, four for Best Picture, two for Best Director, three for Original Screenplay, and one for Adapted Screenplay – winning Best Director for Reds (1981).  Beatty is one of only two people (Orson Welles for Citizen Kane being the other) to have been nominated for acting in, directing, writing, and producing the same film, and he did it twice: first for Heaven Can Wait (1978), and again for Reds (1981). 

Reelin<====>62810<====>Reelin  Reelin (RELN)  is a large secreted extracellular matrix glycoprotein that helps regulate processes of neuronal migration and positioning in the developing brain by controlling cell-cell interactions.  Besides this important role in early development, reelin continues to work in the adult brain.  It modulates synaptic plasticity by enhancing the induction and maintenance of long-term potentiation.    It also stimulates dendrite  and dendritic spine  development and regulates the continuing migration of neuroblasts generated in adult neurogenesis sites like subventricular and subgranular zones.  It is found not only in the brain, but also in the spinal cord, blood, and other body organs and tissues. 

Walter Matthau<====>62811<====>Walter Matthau Walter Matthau ( ;  born Walter John Matthow; October 1, 1920 – July 1, 2000) was an American actor and comedian, best known for his role as Oscar Madison in The Odd Couple and its sequel 30 years later, The Odd Couple II, and his frequent collaborations with Odd Couple co-star Jack Lemmon, particularly in the '90s with Grumpy Old Men and its sequel Grumpier Old Men.  He won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in the 1966 Billy Wilder film The Fortune Cookie.  Besides the Oscar, he was the winner of BAFTA, Golden Globe and Tony awards. 

Neuropil<====>62812<====>Neuropil  Neuropil (or "neuropile") is any area in the nervous system composed of mostly unmyelinated axons, dendrites and glial cell processes that forms a synaptically dense region containing a relatively low number of cell bodies.  The most prevalent anatomical region of neuropil is the brain which, although not completely composed of neuropil, does have the largest and highest synaptically-concentrated areas of neuropil in the body.  For example, the neocortex and olfactory bulb both contain neuropil.    White matter, which is mostly composed of axons and glial cells, is generally not considered to be a part of the neuropil. 

478 BC<====>62820<====>478 BC    Year 478 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.  At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Mamercus and Structus (or, less frequently, year 276 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 478 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. Events By placeGreeceDespite Spartan opposition, Athens is refortified as well as rebuilt after the Persian destruction of the city. With the help of the Athenian statesman and general, Cimon, Aristides commands an Athenian fleet of 30 ships that the Spartan commander Pausanias leads to free the Greek cities on Cyprus and capture Byzantium from the Persians and their Phoenician allies. 

Bennelong<====>62822<====>Bennelong   Woollarawarre Bennelong (c. 1764 – 3 January 1813) (also: "Baneelon")    was a senior man of the Eora, an Aboriginal (Koori) people of the Port Jackson area, at the time of the first British settlement in Australia, in 1788. Bennelong served as an interlocutor between the Eora and the British, both in Sydney and in the United Kingdom. Personal detailsBennelong was a member of the Wangal Clan, connected with the south side of Parramatta River, having close ties with the Wallumedegal clan, on the west side of the river, and the Burra  mattagal clan near today's Parramatta. He had several sisters, including Warreeweer and Carangarang, who married important men from nearby clans, thereby creating political links for their brother.Bennelong had a daughter named Dilboong who died in infancy, and a son who was adopted by the Rev. William Walker, who christened him Thomas Walker. Thomas died in 1823 after a short illness aged about 20.   Capture and life in the British settlementBennelong was brought to the settlement at Sydney Cove in November 1789 by order of the governor, Arthur Phillip, who was under instructions from King George III to establish relationships with the indigenous populations. At that time the Eora conscientiously avoided contact with the newcomers, and in desperation Phillip resorted to kidnap. A man named Arabanoo was captured, but he, like many other Aboriginal people near the settlement, died in a smallpox epidemic a few months later in May 1789.  Bennelong (married at the time to Barangaroo) was captured with Colbee (married to Daringa) in December 1789 as part of Phillip's plan to learn the language and customs of the local people. His age, at the time of his capture, was estimated at 25, and he was described as being 'of good stature, stoutly made', with a 'bold, intrepid countenance'. His appetite was such that 'the ration of a week was insufficient to have kept him for a day', and 'love and war seemed his favourite pursuits'.   Colbee soon escaped, but Bennelong stayed in the settlement for about six months. He then escaped also, but renewed contact with Phillip as a free man.About three months after his escape, he organised for Phillip to visit Manly where Phillip was speared in the shoulder. He maintained ongoing good relations with the colony and in a gesture of kinship, gave Phillip the Aboriginal name Wolawaree.   He learned to speak English.  In 1790, the governor built him a hut on what became known as Bennelong Point (now occupied by the Sydney Opera House).Visit to EnglandBennelong and another Aboriginal man named Yemmerrawanne (or Imeerawanyee) travelled with Phillip on Atlantic to England in 1792. Many historians have claimed that they were presented to King George III, but there is no direct evidence that this occurred.  > Soon after their arrival in England they were hurriedly made clothes that would have been suitable for their presentation to the King.   Jack Brook reconstructs some of their activities from the expense claims lodged with the government. They visited St Paul's Cathedral and the Tower of London. A boat was hired, and they went bathing. They went to the theatre. While in London they resided with Henry Waterhouse, and when Yemmerrawanne became sick, they moved to Eltham and resided at the house of Edward Kent where they were tended by Mr and Mrs Phillips, and met Lord Sydney. Yemmerrawanne died while in Britain after a serious chest infection, and Bennelong's health deteriorated. He returned to Sydney in February 1795 on HMS Reliance, the ship that took surgeon George Bass to the colony for the first time. He taught Bass some of his language on the voyage. Return to New South WalesBennelong arrived back in Sydney on 7 September 1795. He returned to a respected position in the colony, advising Governor Hunter as he had advised and educated Phillip, and also returned to a prominent position in Eora political and cultural life. He frequently participated in payback battles, and officiated at ceremonies, including the last recorded initiation ceremony in Port Jackson in 1797. By the early 18th century, he was the leader of a 100-strong clan living on the north side of the river to the west of Kissing Point in Wallumedagal country.  A letter he had drafted in 1796 to Mr and Mrs Phillips is the first known text written in English by an indigenous Australian, thanking Mrs Phillips for caring for him in England, and asking for stockings and a handkerchief. DeathHe died on 3 January 1813 at Kissing Point on the Parramatta River in Sydney, and was buried in the orchard of the brewer James Squire, a great friend to Bennelong and his clan.    On 20 March 2011 Dr Peter Mitchell of Macquarie University announced that he had located the actual grave site in the garden of a private house in present-day Putney.  A FOR SALE sign went on the house in December 2017, causing some concern.  Peter Mitchell in 2011 stated that local Aboriginal authorities would be consulted about possible further exploration of the site but little further ever transpired.   Some also think a wife of Bennelong was buried there too (but not his best-known wife Barangaroo).   There is a plaque at the end of Watson Street in Putney, about 60m from where Bennelong's grave is thought to be located at the corner with Hordern Street, which has been there since 1988 and reads thus: "Bennelong's burial site; Bennelong was an Aborigine who befriended the first colonists, lived for a while as Governor Phillip's guest and visited England where he became the toast of society. Following his death, he was buried hereabouts beside his wife and Nanbaree another Aborigine".  His obituary in the Sydney Gazette  was unflattering, insisting that "...he was a thorough savage, not to be warped from the form and character that nature gave him...", which reflected the feelings of some in Sydney's white society that Bennelong had abandoned his role as ambassador in his last years, and also reflects the deteriorating relations between the two groups as more and more land was cleared and fenced for farming, and the hardening attitudes of many colonists towards 'savages' who were not willing to give up their country and become labourers and servants useful to the colonists.   Bennelong's people mourned his death with a traditional payback battle for which about two hundred people gathered. It was witnessed by a passenger on the schooner Henrietta who reported it in a letter to the Caledonian Mercury. They wrote that spears flew very thick, and about thirty men were wounded. As a mark of respect, Colebee's nephew Nanberry, who died in 1821, was buried with Bennelong at his request.   Bidgee Bidgee, who led the Kissing Point clan for twenty years after Bennelong's death, also asked to be buried with Bennelong, but there is no record of his death or where he is buried.  LegacyBennelong’s friendship with British colonists brought other indigenous people into contact with the Sydney Cove colony. In contributing to some of the first cross cultural communication between the groups he helped establish a short period of relative peace between the two peoples. Bennelong Park is a small park next to Kissing Point in Putney, Sydney, near where Bennelong died.The seat of Bennelong in the Federal parliament is named after him. Bennelong was the first Indigenous Australian to be honoured in the name of an electoral division.Bennelong Point, today the site of the Sydney Opera House, is named after him.A memorial in Cleves Park in Putney, Sydney, marks the area near where he is thought to be buried.An ostracod genus, Bennelongia has been named after him in 1981. This genus is endemic to Australia and New Zealand.

Density matrix<====>62844<====>Density matrix   A density matrix is a matrix that describes a quantum system in a mixed state, a statistical ensemble of several quantum states.  This should be contrasted with a single state vector that describes a quantum system in a pure state.  The density matrix is the quantum-mechanical analogue to a phase-space probability measure (probability distribution of position and momentum) in classical statistical mechanics. Mixed states arise in situations where the experimenter does not know which particular states are being manipulated.  Examples include a system in thermal equilibrium (or additionally chemical equilibrium) or a system with an uncertain or randomly varying preparation history (so one does not know which pure state the system is in). 

United States Department of Energy<====>62866<====>United States Department of Energy    The United States Department of Energy (DOE) is a Cabinet-level department of the United States Government concerned with the United States' policies regarding energy and safety in handling nuclear material.  Its responsibilities include the nation's nuclear weapons program, nuclear reactor production for the United States Navy, energy conservation, energy-related research, radioactive waste disposal, and domestic energy production.  It also directs research in genomics; the Human Genome Project originated in a DOE initiative.   DOE sponsors more research in the physical sciences than any other U. S.  federal agency, the majority of which is conducted through its system of National Laboratories. 

Faboideae<====>62884<====>Faboideae The Faboideae are a subfamily of the flowering plant family Fabaceae or Leguminosae.  An acceptable alternative name for the subfamily is Papilionoideae, or Papilionaceae when this group of plants is treated as a family.  This subfamily is widely distributed, and members are adapted to a wide variety of environments.  Faboideae may be trees, shrubs, or herbaceous plants.  Members include the pea, the sweet pea, the laburnum, and other legumes.  The flowers are classically pea-shaped, and root nodulation is very common. GeneraThe type genus, Faba, is a synonym of Vicia, and is listed here as Vicia. 

Gordon Setter<====>62888<====>Gordon Setter The Gordon Setter is a large breed of dog, a member of the setter family that also includes both the better-known Irish Setter and the English Setter.  Setter breeds are classified as members of either the Sporting or Gundog Group depending on the national kennel club or council.   The original purpose of the breed was to hunt gamebirds.  Their quarry in the United Kingdom, may be partridge or grouse, pheasant, ptarmigan, blackgame, snipe or woodcock: whilst overseas bird dogs are worked on quail, willow grouse, sand grouse, guinea fowl, sagehen, francolin and any other bird that will sit to a dog—that is to say, will attempt to avoid a potential predator by concealment rather than by taking to the wing at the first sign of danger. 

Night monkey<====>62889<====>Night monkey The night monkeys, also known as the owl monkeys or douroucoulis, are the members of the genus Aotus of New World monkeys (monotypic in family Aotidae).  The only nocturnal monkeys, they are native to Panama and much of tropical South America.  Night monkeys constitute one of the few monkey species that are affected by the often deadly human malaria protozoan Plasmodium falciparum, making them useful as non-human primate experimental subjects in malaria research.  TaxonomyUntil 1983, all night monkeys were placed into only one (A.  lemurimus) or two species (A.  lemurinus and A.  azarae). 

English Setter<====>62891<====>English Setter  The English Setter is a medium size breed of dog.  It is part of the Setter family, which includes the red Irish Setters, Irish Red and White Setters, and black-and-tan Gordon Setters.  The mainly white body coat is of medium length with long silky fringes on the back of the legs, under the belly and on the tail.  The coat features flecks of colour, and the different colour varieties are referred to as belton. A gentle but at times strong-willed, mischievous gun dog, bred for a mix of endurance and athleticism, it is used to hunt for game such as quail, pheasant, and grouse. 

Dingo<====>62893<====>Dingo    The dingo (Canis lupus dingo  or Canis dingo    ) is a type of feral dog   native to Australia.    The first British colonists to arrive in 1788 established a settlement at Port Jackson and recorded dingoes living there with indigenous Australians.   Although the dingo exists in the wild,  it associates with humans but has not been selectively bred similarly to other domesticated animals.    It is a medium-sized canid that possesses a lean, hardy body designed for speed, agility and stamina.  The dingo's three main coat colours are described as being either light ginger (or tan), black and tan, or creamy white. 

Australian Kelpie<====>62895<====>Australian Kelpie  The Australian Kelpie, or simply Kelpie, is an Australian sheep dog successful at mustering and droving with little or no guidance.  It is a medium-sized dog and comes in a variety of colours.  The Kelpie has been exported throughout the world and is used to muster livestock, primarily sheep, cattle and goats. The breed has been separated into two distinct varieties: the Show (or Bench) Kelpie and the Working Kelpie.The Show Kelpie is seen at conformation dog shows in some countries and is selected for appearance rather than working instinct, while the Working Kelpie is bred for working ability rather than appearance. 

George McGovern<====>62896<====>George McGovern    George Stanley McGovern (July 19, 1922 – October 21, 2012) was an American historian, author, U. S.  Representative, U. S.  Senator, and the Democratic Party presidential nominee in the 1972 presidential election. McGovern grew up in Mitchell, South Dakota, where he was a renowned debater.  He volunteered for the U. S.  Army Air Forces upon the country's entry into World War II and as a B-24 Liberator pilot flew 35 frequently dangerous missions over German-occupied Europe.  Among the medals bestowed upon him was a Distinguished Flying Cross for making a hazardous emergency landing of his damaged plane and saving his crew. 

Sherden<====>62897<====>SherdenThe Sherden (Egyptian šrdn, š3rd3n3 or š3rdyn3, Ugaritic šrdnn(m) and trtn(m), possibly Akkadian še–er–ta–an–nu; also glossed “Shardana” or “Sherdanu”) are one of several groups of "Sea Peoples" who appear in fragmentary historical and iconographic records (Egyptian and Ugaritic) from the Eastern Mediterranean in the late second millennium BCE. On reliefs they are shown carrying round shields and spears,  dirks, or swords, perhaps of Naue II type.   In some cases they are shown wearing corselets and kilts, but their key distinguishing feature is a horned helmet which, in all cases but three, features a circular accouterment at the crest. 

Daphnia<====>62898<====>Daphnia Daphnia, a genus of small planktonic crustaceans, are   in length.  Daphnia are members of the order Cladocera, and are one of the several small aquatic crustaceans commonly called water fleas because their saltatory ( ) swimming style resembles the movements of fleas.  Daphnia live in various aquatic environments ranging from acidic swamps to freshwater lakes, ponds, streams and rivers. The two most readily available species of Daphnia are D.  pulex (small and most common) and D.  magna (large).  They are often associated with a related genus in the order Cladocera: Moina, which is in the Moinidae family instead of Daphniidae and is much smaller than D. 

Stuart Kauffman<====>62902<====>Stuart Kauffman  Stuart Alan Kauffman (born September 28, 1939) is an American medical doctor, theoretical biologist, and complex systems researcher who studies the origin of life on Earth.   He was a professor at the University of Chicago, University of Pennsylvania, and University of Calgary.  He is currently emeritus professor of biochemistry at the University of Pennsylvania and affiliate faculty at the Institute for Systems Biology.  He has a number of awards including a MacArthur Fellowship and a Wiener Medal. He is best known for arguing that the complexity of biological systems and organisms might result as much from self-organization and far-from-equilibrium dynamics as from Darwinian natural selection as discussed in his book Origins of Order (1993). 

Albertville<====>62905<====>Albertville   Albertville ( ; Arpitan: Arbèrtvile) is a commune in the Savoie department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in south-eastern France. The town is best known for hosting the 1992 Winter Olympics. GeographyAlbertville is situated on the Arly River, close to the confluence with the Isère River.  Its altitude is between  . Nearby mountains include: Belle Etoile, Dent de Cons, Négresse, Roche Pourrie, Mirantin, Pointe de la Grande Journée, and Chaîne du Grand Arc. Nearby mountain ranges include: the Bauges; the Beaufortain; and the beginning of the Vanoise. Albertville is also one of two subprefectures of the Savoie department, alongside Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne. 

Pont d'Arc<====>62908<====>Pont d'ArcThe Pont d'Arc (French pont = bridge) is a large natural bridge, located in the Ardèche département in the south of France, 5 km from the town of Vallon-Pont-d'Arc.  The arch, formed when the Ardèche River broke through a narrow escarpment between its meander, is   wide and   high at the top of the opening.It is a very popular canoeing and kayaking area and is heavily visited by tourists.  It is usually described as the natural entrance to the Ardèche Canyon.  In the near vicinity of the arch is the Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc Cave, containing one of the earliest known paleolithic cave paintings, about 30,000 years old (featured in the 3D documentary Cave of Forgotten Dreams by film director Werner Herzog). 

Montparnasse<====>62909<====>Montparnasse Montparnasse ( )( French   )  is an area of Paris, France, on the left bank of the river Seine, centred at the crossroads of the Boulevard du Montparnasse and the Rue de Rennes, between the Rue de Rennes and boulevard Raspail.

Auction<====>62912<====>Auction  An auction is a process of buying and selling goods or services by offering them up for bid, taking bids, and then selling the item to the highest bidder.  The open ascending price auction is arguably the most common form of auction in use today.   Participants bid openly against one another, with each subsequent bid required to be higher than the previous bid.An auctioneer may announce prices, bidders may call out their bids themselves (or have a proxy call out a bid on their behalf), or bids may be submitted electronically with the highest current bid publicly displayed.

Aqua regia<====>62929<====>Aqua regia Aqua regia   (from Latin,   "royal water" or "king's water") is a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid,  optimally in a molar ratio of 1:3.  Aqua regia is a yellow-orange fuming liquid, so named by alchemists because it can dissolve the noble metals gold and platinum, though not all metals. ApplicationsAqua regia is primarily used to produce chloroauric acid, the electrolyte in the Wohlwill process for refining the highest quality (99. 999%)   gold. Aqua regia is also used in etching and in specific analytic procedures.  It is also used in some laboratories to clean glassware of organic compounds and metal particles. 

Sonny Carter<====>62931<====>Sonny Carter  Manley Lanier "Sonny" Carter Jr. , M. D.  (August 15, 1947 – April 5, 1991), (Capt, USN), was an American chemist, physician, professional soccer player, naval officer and aviator, test pilot, and NASA astronaut who flew on STS-33. Early life and educationSonny Carter was born on August 15, 1947, to parents Manley L.  Carter Sr.  and Elizabeth C.  Carter in Macon, Georgia, but considered Warner Robins, Georgia, to be his hometown.   He graduated from Lanier High School in Macon in 1965, and during his high school years was involved actively in Macon-based Troop 19 of the Boy Scouts of America, where he also served a term as Senior Patrol Leader, the highest leadership position for a young man in that BSA troop, and earned its highest rank of Eagle Scout. 

Burma Railway<====>62933<====>Burma Railway    The Burma Railway, also known as the Death Railway, the Burma–Siam Railway, the Thailand–Burma Railway and similar names, was a   railway between Ban Pong, Thailand, and Thanbyuzayat, Burma, built by the Empire of Japan in 1943 to support its forces in the Burma campaign of World War II.  This railway completed the rail link between Bangkok, Thailand, and Rangoon, Burma (now Yangon).  The line was closed in 1947, but the section between Nong Pla Duk and Nam Tok was reopened ten years later in 1957. Between 180,000 and 250,000 Southeast Asian civilian labourers (rōmusha) and about 61,000 Allied prisoners of war were subjected to forced labour during its construction. 

Claus von Stauffenberg<====>62935<====>Claus von Stauffenberg  Claus Philipp Maria Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg  (15 November 1907 – 21 July 1944) was a German army officer and member of the German nobility who was one of the leading members of the failed 20 July plot of 1944 to assassinate Adolf Hitler and remove the Nazi Party from power.  Along with Henning von Tresckow and Hans Oster, he was one of the central figures of the German Resistance movement within the Wehrmacht.  For his involvement in the movement, he was executed by firing squad shortly after the failed attempt known as Operation Valkyrie. 

Perejil Island<====>62936<====>Perejil Island   Perejil Island ( , Berber: Tura,  )  is a small, uninhabited rocky islet located off the coast of Morocco, just 200 metres from the mainland coast.  Its sovereignty is disputed between Spain and Morocco.  It was the subject of an armed incident between the two countries in 2002. NameThe name Isla de Perejil literally means "Parsley Island" in Spanish.Its original Berber name is Tura, meaning "empty".   Moroccan and international media often mistakenly use the name Laila (ليلى) due to a confusion resulting from it being referred to as "la isla" ("the island") pronounced in Spanish with Andalusian accent, rendering "lah ihla" or laíla. 

Count Dooku<====>62948<====>Count Dooku  Count Dooku is a fictional character from the Star Wars franchise, appearing in Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones and  Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith, as a primary antagonist.  He was portrayed by Christopher Lee  and voiced by Corey Burton in the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars: Clone Wars. Once a respected Jedi Master, he falls to the dark side of the Force after the death of his former Padawan, Qui-Gon Jinn, and becomes Darth Sidious' second apprentice under the name Darth Tyranus. 

Ternary numeral system<====>62950<====>Ternary numeral system  The ternary numeral system (also called base-3) has three as its base. Analogous to a bit, a ternary digit is a trit (trinary digit). One trit is equivalent to log 2 3 (about 1.58496) bits of information.Although ternary most often refers to a system in which the three digits are all non-negative numbers, specifically  ,  , and  , the adjective also lends its name to the balanced ternary system, comprising the digits −1, 0 and +1, used in comparison logic and ternary computers.Comparison to other radicesA ternary multiplication table×  1  2  10  11  12  20  21  22  100  1  1  2  10  11  12  20  21  22  100 2  2  11  20  22  101  110  112  121  200 10  10  20  100  110  120  200  210  220  1000 11  11  22  110  121  202  220  1001  1012  1100  12  12  101  120  202  221  1010  1022  1111  1200  20  20  110  200  220  1010  1100  1120  1210  2000 21  21  112  210  1001  1022  1120  1211  2002  2100 22  22  121  220  1012  1111  1210  2002  2101  2200 100  100  200  1000  1100  1200  2000  2100  2200  10000 Representations of integer numbers in ternary do not get uncomfortably lengthy as quickly as in binary.

This is most commonly seen in CMOS circuits, and also in Transistor–transistor logic logic with totem-pole output. The output is said to either be low (grounded), high, or open (high-Z). In this configuration the output of the circuit is actually not connected to any voltage reference at all. Where the signal is usually grounded to a certain reference, or at a certain voltage level, the state is said to be high impedance because it is open and serves its own reference. Thus, the actual voltage level is sometimes unpredictable.A rare "ternary point" is used to denote fractional parts of an inning in baseball. Since each inning consists of three outs, each out is considered one third of an inning and is denoted as .1. For example, if a player pitched all of the 4th, 5th and 6th innings, plus 2 outs of the 7th inning, his Innings pitched column for that game would be listed as 3.2, meaning 3⅔.  In this usage, only the fractional part of the number is written in ternary form.Ternary numbers can be used to convey self-similar structures like the Sierpinski triangle or the Cantor set conveniently. Additionally, it turns out that the ternary representation is useful for defining the Cantor set and related point sets, because of the way the Cantor set is constructed.  The Cantor set consists of the points from 0 to 1 that have a ternary expression that does not contain any instance of the digit 1.   Any terminating expansion in the ternary system is equivalent to the expression that is identical up to the term preceding the last non-zero term followed by the term one less than the last nonzero term of the first expression, followed by an infinite tail of twos.  For example: .1020 is equivalent to .1012222... because the expansions are the same until the "two" of the first expression, the two was decremented in the second expansion, and trailing zeros were replaced with trailing twos in the second expression.Ternary is the integer base with the lowest radix economy, followed closely by binary and quaternary.  It has been used for some computing systems because of this efficiency.  It is also used to represent three-option trees, such as phone menu systems, which allow a simple path to any branch.A form of redundant binary representation called balanced ternary or signed-digit representation is sometimes used in low-level software and hardware to accomplish fast addition of integers because it can eliminate carries. Binary-coded ternarySimulation of ternary computers using binary computers, or interfacing between ternary and binary computers, can involve use of binary-coded ternary (BCT) numbers, with two bits used to encode each trit.  Behrooz Parhami and Michael McKeown, Arithmetic with Binary-Encoded Balanced Ternary Numbers, Proc. 2013 Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers, Nov. 3–6, 2013, Pacific Grove, CA, 1130–1133  BCT encoding is analogous to binary-coded decimal encoding.  If the trit values 0, 1 and 2 are encoded 00, 01 and 10, conversion in either direction between binary-coded ternary and binary can be done in logarithmic time.  A library of C code supporting BCT arithmetic is available. TryteSome ternary computers such as the Setun defined a tryte to be six trits  or approximately 9.5 bit (holding more information than the de facto binary byte).

Pope Adeodatus I<====>62951<====>Pope Adeodatus I   Pope Adeodatus I (570 - 8 November 618), also called Deodatus I or Deusdedit,  was Pope from 19 October 615 to his death in 618.  BiographyHe was born in Rome, the son of a subdeacon.  He served as a priest for 40 years before his election and was the first priest to be elected pope since John II in 533.  Adeodatus represents the second wave of anti-Gregorian challenge to the papacy, the first being that of Sabinian.   He reversed the practice of his predecessor Boniface IV of filling the papal administrative ranks with monks by recalling the clergy to such positions and by ordaining some 14 priests, the first ordinations in Rome since Pope Gregory. 

Qui-Gon Jinn<====>62952<====>Qui-Gon Jinn  Qui-Gon Jinn is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise, portrayed by Liam Neeson as one of the main protagonists of the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace. DepictionFilmsThe Phantom Menace (1999)Qui-Gon is one of the main characters in the first episode of the prequel trilogy, Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace.  He is a Jedi Master and mentor of Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Unlike other, more conservative Jedi, he values living in the moment as the best way to embrace the Force.  Jinn is not a member of the Jedi Council, despite being among the wisest and most powerful of the Jedi. 

Gulf of Tonkin incident<====>62982<====>Gulf of Tonkin incident The Gulf of Tonkin incident ( ), also known as the USS Maddox incident, was an international confrontation that led to the United States engaging more directly in the Vietnam War.  It involved either one or two separate confrontations involving North Vietnam and the United States in the waters of the Gulf of Tonkin.  The original American report blamed North Vietnam for both incidents, but eventually became very controversial with widespread claims that either one or both incidents were false, and possibly deliberately so.  On August 2, 1964, the destroyer  , while performing a signals intelligence patrol as part of DESOTO operations, was pursued by three North Vietnamese Navy torpedo boats of the 135th Torpedo Squadron. 

Medicago<====>62983<====>Medicago Medicago is a genus of flowering plants, commonly known as medick or burclover, in the legume (Fabaceae) family.  It contains at least 87 species and is distributed mainly around the Mediterranean basin.   The best-known member of the genus is alfalfa (M.  sativa), an important forage crop,  and the genus name is based on the Latin name for that plant, medica, from   median (grass).   Most members of the genus are low, creeping herbs, resembling clover, but with burs (hence the common name).  However, alfalfa grows to a height of 1 meter, and tree medick (M. 

Nun<====>62984<====>Nun  A nun   is a member of a religious community of women, typically one living under vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience.  The Oxford English Dictionary, vol X, page 599.   She may have decided to dedicate her life to serving all other living beings, or she might be an ascetic who voluntarily chose to leave mainstream society and live her life in prayer and contemplation in a monastery or convent.   The term "nun" is applicable to Catholics (eastern and western traditions), Orthodox Christians, Anglicans, Lutherans, Jains, Buddhists, Taoists, Hindus and some other religious traditions.

He currently holds fellowships and chairmanships with several public policy councils and think-tanks, including the Constitution Project and  the Heritage Foundation.   He is also a Distinguished Visiting Fellow with the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. 

Theophylline<====>62996<====>Theophylline Theophylline, also known as 1,3-dimethylxanthine, is a methylxanthine drug used in therapy for respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma under a variety of brand names.  As a member of the xanthine family, it bears structural and pharmacological similarity to theobromine and caffeine, and is readily found in nature, and is present in tea (Camellia sinensis) and cocoa (Theobroma cacao).  A small amount of theophylline is one of the products of caffeine metabolic processing in the liver.  Medical usesThe main actions of theophylline involve:relaxing bronchial smooth muscleincreasing heart muscle contractility and efficiency; as a positive inotropeincreasing heart rate: (positive chronotropic) increasing blood pressureincreasing renal blood flowanti-inflammatory effectscentral nervous system stimulatory effect mainly on the medullary respiratory center. 

Pope Mark<====>63001<====>Pope MarkPope Mark ( ; died 7 October 336) was the 34th Pope of the Catholic Church from 18 January to 7 October 336. Little is known of his early life.  According to the Liber Pontificalis, he was a Roman, and his father's name was Priscus.  Mark succeeded St.  Sylvester as pope on 18 January 336.  He held office only eight months and twenty days, dying on 7 October following.  Butler, Alban.  "St.  Mark, Pope", Lives of the Saints, Benziger Bros. , 1894  Some evidence suggests that the early lists of bishops and martyrs known as the Depositio episcoporum and Depositio martyrum were begun during his pontificate.

Pope Simplicius<====>63005<====>Pope Simplicius   Pope Simplicius (died 10 March 483) was Pope from 468 to his death in 483.  He was born in Tivoli, Italy, the son of a citizen named Castinus.  Most of what is known of him is derived from the Liber Pontificalis.    BiographySimplicius defended the action of the Council of Chalcedon against the Eutychian heresy, labored to help the people of Italy against the marauding raids of barbarian invaders, and saw the Heruli mercenaries revolt and proclaim Odoacer king of Italy in 476,  having deposed Romulus Augustulus, the last Western Roman Emperor. 

Pope Felix III<====>63006<====>Pope Felix III  Pope Felix III (died 1 March 492) was Pope from 13 March 483 to his death in 492.  Coleman, Ambrose.  "Pope St.  Felix III. " The Catholic Encyclopedia.  Vol.  6.  New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909.  6 Apr.  2013  His repudiation of the Henotikon is considered the beginning of the Acacian schism. BiographyFelix was born into a Roman senatorial family and was said to be a great-great-grandfather of Pope Gregory I.   It was also said that Felix appeared as an apparition to one of his descendants, his great-granddaughter Trasilla (an aunt of Pope Gregory I), and asked her to enter Heaven through death, and on the eve of Christmas Trasilla died, seeing Jesus Christ beckoning. 

20 July plot<====>63007<====>20 July plot    On 20 July 1944, Claus von Stauffenberg and other conspirators attempted to assassinate Adolf Hitler, Führer of Nazi Germany,  inside his Wolf's Lair field headquarters near Rastenburg, East Prussia.  The name Operation Valkyrie, originally referring to part of the conspiracy, has become associated with the entire event.  The apparent aim of the assassination attempt was to wrest political control of Germany and its armed forces from the Nazi Party (including the SS) and to make peace with the western Allies as soon as possible.  The underlying desire of many of the  high-ranking Wehrmacht officers involved was apparently to show the world that not all Germans were like Hitler and the Nazi Party. 

Pope Symmachus<====>63008<====>Pope Symmachus  Pope Symmachus (d.  19 July 514) was Pope from 22 November 498 to his death in 514.   His tenure was marked by a serious schism over who was legitimately elected pope by the citizens of Rome.  Early lifeHe was born on the Mediterranean island of Sardinia (then under Vandal rule), the son of Fortunatus; Jeffrey Richards notes that he was born a pagan, and "perhaps the rankest outsider" of all the Ostrogothic Popes, most of whom were members of aristocratic families.   Symmachus was baptized in Rome, where he became Archdeacon of the Roman Church under Pope Anastasius II (496–498). 

Pope Hormisdas<====>63010<====>Pope Hormisdas  Pope Hormisdas (450 – 6 August 523) was Pope from 20 July 514 to his death in 523.His papacy was dominated by the Acacian schism, started in 484 by Acacius of Constantinople's efforts to placate the Monophysites.  His efforts to resolve this schism were successful, and on 28 March 519, the reunion between Constantinople and Rome was ratified in the cathedral of Constantinople before a large crowd.  Jeffrey Richards explains Hormisdas' Persian name as probably in honour of an exiled Persian noble, Hormizd, "celebrated in the Roman martyrology (8 August) but not so honoured in the East. 

Nocturnality<====>63011<====>Nocturnality    Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by being active during the night and sleeping during the day.  The common adjective is "nocturnal", versus diurnal meaning the opposite. Nocturnal creatures generally have highly developed senses of hearing, smell, and specially adapted eyesight.  Such traits can help animals such as the Helicoverpa zea moths avoid predators.   Some animals, such as cats and ferrets, have eyes that can adapt to both lowlevel and bright day levels of illumination (see metaturnal).  Others, such as bushbabies and (some) bats, can function only at night.  Many nocturnal creatures including tarsiers and some owls have large eyes in comparison with their body size to compensate for the lower light levels at night. 

Pope John I<====>63012<====>Pope John IPope John I can also refer to Pope John I of Alexandria.  Pope John I ( ; d.  18 May 526) was Pope from 13 August 523 to his death in 526.He was a native of Siena (or the "Castello di Serena", near Chiusdino), in Italy.  He was sent on a diplomatic mission to Constantinople by the Ostrogoth King Theodoric to negotiate better treatment for Arians.  Although relatively successful, upon his return to Ravenna, Theodoric had the Pope imprisoned for allegedly conspiring with Constantinople.  The frail pope died of neglect and ill-treatment. 

Pope Felix IV<====>63014<====>Pope Felix IV    Pope Felix IV (III) (d.  22 September 530) served as the Pope of the Catholic Church from 12 July 526 to his death in 530.  He was the chosen candidate of Ostrogoth King Theodoric, who had imprisoned Felix's predecessor.  BiographyHe came from Samnium, the son of one Castorius.  He was elected after a gap of nearly two months after the death of John I, who had died in prison in Ravenna, having completed a diplomatic mission to Constantinople on behalf of the Ostrogoth King Theodoric the Great.  The papal electors acceded to the king's demands and chose Cardinal Felix as Pope. 

Pope Vigilius<====>63021<====>Pope Vigilius   Pope Vigilius (d.  7 June 555) Mellersh, H. E. L.  (1999) The Hutchinson chronology of world history.  Volume 1.  The ancient and medieval world: Prehistory – AD 1491.  Oxford: Helicon, p.  221.was Pope from 29 March 537 to his death in 555.He is considered the first pope of the Byzantine Papacy. Early lifeHe belonged to an aristocratic Roman family; his father Johannes is identified as a consul in the Liber pontificalis, having received that title from the emperor.   According to Procopius, his brother Reparatus was one of the senators taken hostage by Witigis, but managed to escape before the Ostrogothic king ordered their slaughter in 537. 

Pope Pelagius I<====>63022<====>Pope Pelagius I  Pope Pelagius I (d.  4 March 561) was Pope from 556 to his death in 561.  He was the second pope of the Byzantine Papacy, and like his predecessor, a former apocrisiarius to Constantinople. Early lifeHe came from a Roman noble family.   His father John seems to have been vicar of one of the two civil "dioceses", or districts, into which Italy was then divided.    Apokrisiariat Pelagius accompanied Pope Agapetus I to Constantinople and was appointed by him nuncio of the Roman Church to that city.  Pelagius acquired great influence with Justinian, and returned to Rome in 543. 

Precision Club<====>63023<====>Precision Club Precision Club is a bidding system in the game of contract bridge.  It is a strong club system developed in 1969 for C.  C.  Wei by Alan Truscott, and used by Taiwan teams in 1969.  Their success in placing second at the 1969 Bermuda Bowl (and Wei's multimillion-dollar publicity campaign) launched the system's popularity.  The central feature of the Precision system is that an opening bid of one club is used for any hand with 16 or more high card points (HCP), regardless of distribution.  An opening bid of one of a major suit signifies a five-card suit and 11-15 HCP. 

Strong club system<====>63024<====>Strong club system The Strong Club System is a set of bidding conventions and agreements used in the game of contract bridge and is based upon an opening bid of 1  as being an artificial forcing bid promising a strong hand.   The strong 1   opening is assigned a minimum strength promising 16 or more high card points.  All other bids would therefore be limited to a maximum of 15 high card points.  There are several variants of the strong club system and all are classified as artificial because the bids are highly codified. 

Variable star<====>63025<====>Variable star  A variable star is a star whose brightness as seen from Earth (its apparent magnitude) fluctuates. This variation may be caused by a change in emitted light or by something partly blocking the light, so variable stars are classified as either:Intrinsic variables, whose luminosity actually changes; for example, because the star periodically swells and shrinks. Extrinsic variables, whose apparent changes in brightness are due to changes in the amount of their light that can reach Earth; for example, because the star has an orbiting companion that sometimes eclipses it. Many, possibly most, stars have at least some variation in luminosity: the energy output of our Sun, for example, varies by about 0. 

Pope John III<====>63026<====>Pope John IIIPope John III can also refer to Pope John III of Alexandria.  Pope John III ( ; d.  13 July 574) was Pope from 17 July 561 to his death in 574.He was born in Rome of a distinguished family.  The Liber Pontificalis calls him a son of one Anastasius.

Mauthausen<====>63027<====>Mauthausen Mauthausen is a small market town in the Austrian state of Upper Austria.  It is located at about 20 kilometres east of the city of Linz. During the Second World War, it became the site of the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp complex. HistoryThe area of Mauthausen has been settled for many millennia, as shown by archaeological discoveries dating back to the Neolithic age.  During the time of the Roman Empire, it was at the crossroads of two trade routes. At the end of the 10th century it became a toll (Maut in German) station for ships, and the name "Muthusen" for the settlement is first mentioned in 1007During the First World War, a prisoner of war camp existed to the east of Mauthausen. 

Pope Pelagius II<====>63028<====>Pope Pelagius II  Pope Pelagius II (d.  7 February 590) was Pope from 26 November 579 to his death in 590.    Pelagius was a native of Rome, but probably of Ostrogothic descent, as his father's name was Winigild.  Pelagius appealed for help from Emperor Maurice against the Lombards, but the Eastern Romans were of little help, forcing Pelagius to "buy" a truce and turn to the Franks, who invaded Italy, but left after being bribed by the Lombards.  Pelagius labored to promote the celibacy of the clergy, and he issued such stringent regulations on this matter that his successor Pope Gregory I thought them too strict, and modified them to some extent. 

Pope Severinus<====>63030<====>Pope Severinus Pope Severinus (d.  2 August 640) was Pope two months, from 28 May until his death on 2 Aug.  He became caught up in a power struggle with the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius over the ongoing Monothelite controversy.    Election and struggle with ConstantinopleHe was a Roman.  His father was named Avienus, according to the Liber Pontificalis.  The name of the father suggests descent from members of the Roman Senate.  Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), p.  155  A previous Avienus was Roman consul in 501.   Severinus was elected on the third day after the death of his predecessor, Honorius I, and the Papal apocrisiarii went to Constantinople to obtain imperial confirmation of his election in October 638. 

Hound<====>63031<====>Hound   A hound is a type of dog used by hunters to track or chase prey. DescriptionHounds can be contrasted with gundogs, which assist hunters by identifying the location of prey and/or recovering shot quarry.  The hound breeds were the first hunting dogs.  They have either a powerful sense of smell or great speed.    There are three types of hound, with several breeds within each type:Sighthounds (also called gazehounds), which follow prey predominantly by speed, keeping it in sight.  These dogs are fast and assist hunters in catching game fox, hare, deer and elk.

True owl<====>63034<====>True owl The true owls or typical owls (family Strigidae) are one of the two generally accepted families of owls, the other being the barn owls (Tytonidae).  The Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy unites the Caprimulgiformes with the owl order; here, the typical owls are a subfamily Striginae.  This is unsupported by more recent research (see Cypselomorphae for details), but the relationships of the owls in general are still unresolved.  This large family comprises nearly 220 living species in 25 genera.  The typical owls have a cosmopolitan distribution and are found on every continent except Antarctica. MorphologyWhile typical owls (hereafter referred to simply as owls) vary greatly in size, with the smallest species, the elf owl, being a hundredth the size of the largest, the Eurasian eagle-owl and Blakiston's fish owl, owls generally share an extremely similar body plan. 

Gas van<====>63047<====>Gas vanA gas van or gas wagon (  (dushegubka);  ) was a vehicle reequipped as a mobile gas chamber.  The vehicle had an air-tight compartment for victims, into which exhaust fumes were transmitted while the engine was running.  The victims were gassed with carbon monoxide, resulting in death by monoxide poisoning and suffocation.  The gas van was invented and used by the Soviet secret police NKVD in the late 1930s during the Great Purge.  Yevgenia Albats, KGB: The State Within a State.  1995, page 101   Catherine Merridale.

Eosinophilia–myalgia syndrome<====>63050<====>Eosinophilia–myalgia syndrome Eosinophilia–myalgia syndrome (EMS) is an incurable and sometimes fatal flu-like neurological condition linked to the ingestion of the dietary supplement L-tryptophan.    The risk of developing EMS increases with larger doses of tryptophan and increasing age.   Some research suggests that certain genetic polymorphisms may be related to the development of EMS.   The presence of eosinophilia is a core feature of EMS, along with unusually severe myalgia (muscle pain).Initial outbreakThe first case of eosinophilia–myalgia syndrome was reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in November 1989, although some cases had occurred as early as 2–3 years before this. 

Slugging percentage<====>63059<====>Slugging percentage In baseball statistics, slugging percentage (SLG) is a measure of the batting productivity of a hitter.  It is calculated as total bases divided by at bats, through the following formula, where AB is the number of at-bats for a given player, and 1B, 2B, 3B, and HR are the number of singles, doubles, triples, and home runs, respectively:   \mathrm{SLG} = \frac{(\mathit{1B}) + (2 \times \mathit{2B}) + (3 \times \mathit{3B}) + (4 \times \mathit{HR})}{AB} Unlike batting average, slugging percentage gives more weight to extra-base hits such as doubles and home runs, relative to singles.  Walks are specifically excluded from this calculation, as a plate appearance that ends in a walk is not counted as an at bat. 

Irish National Liberation Army<====>63060<====>Irish National Liberation Army  The Irish National Liberation Army (INLA,  )  is an Irish republican socialist paramilitary group formed in December 1974, during "the Troubles".

The INLA waged a paramilitary campaign against the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in Northern Ireland. 

Bengal cat<====>63064<====>Bengal cat   The Bengal is a domestic cat breed developed to look like exotic jungle cats such as leopards, ocelots, margays and clouded leopards.  Bengal cats were developed by selective breeding from hybrids of the Asian leopard cat (ALC), Prionailurus bengalensis bengalensis, with domestic cat, backcrossed to domestic cats, with the goal of creating a confident, healthy, and friendly cat with a highly contrasted and vividly marked coat.  The name "Bengal cat" was derived from the taxonomic name of the Asian leopard cat (P.  b.  bengalensis).  They have a "wild" appearance with large spots/rosettes/arrowheads, and a light/white belly, and a body structure reminiscent of the ALC.

Stock market crash<====>63074<====>Stock market crashA stock market crash is a sudden dramatic decline of stock prices across a significant cross-section of a stock market, resulting in a significant loss of paper wealth.  Crashes are driven by panic as much as by underlying economic factors.  They often follow speculative stock market bubbles. Stock market crashes are social phenomena where external economic events combine with crowd behavior and psychology in a positive feedback loop where selling by some market participants drives more market participants to sell.  Generally speaking, crashes usually occur under the following conditions:  a prolonged period of rising stock prices and excessive economic optimism, a market where P/E ratios exceed long-term averages, and extensive use of margin debt and leverage by market participants. 

Chaim Soutine<====>63075<====>Chaim Soutine Chaïm Soutine (13 January 1893 – 9 August 1943) was a Russian-French painter of Jewish origin.

Stock market bubble<====>63077<====>Stock market bubble A stock market bubble is a type of economic bubble taking place in stock markets when market participants drive stock prices above their value in relation to some system of stock valuation. Behavioral finance theory attributes stock market bubbles to cognitive biases that lead to groupthink and herd behavior.  Bubbles occur not only in real-world markets, with their inherent uncertainty and noise, but also in highly predictable experimental markets.In the laboratory, uncertainty is eliminated and calculating the expected returns should be a simple mathematical exercise, because participants are endowed with assets that are defined to have a finite lifespan and a known probability distribution of dividends. 

Tsuguharu Foujita<====>63078<====>Tsuguharu Foujita   was a Japanese–French painter and printmaker born in Tokyo, Japan, who applied Japanese ink techniques to Western style paintings.

Market trend<====>63082<====>Market trendA market trend is a perceived tendency of financial markets to move in a particular direction over time.These trends are classified as secular for long time frames, primary for medium time frames, and secondary for short time frames.Traders attempt to identify market trends using technical analysis, a framework which characterizes market trends as predictable price tendencies within the market when price reaches support and resistance levels, varying over time. A trend can only be determined in hindsight, since at any time prices in the future are not known. Market terminology The terms "bull market" and "bear market" describe upward and downward market trends, respectively,  and can be used to describe either the market as a whole or specific sectors and securities. 

Henry Miller<====>63083<====>Henry Miller  Henry Valentine Miller (December 26, 1891 – June 7, 1980) was an American writer, expatriated in Paris at his flourishing.

Siamese cat<====>63087<====>Siamese cat {{Infobox Catbreed  }}The Siamese cat is one of the first distinctly recognized breeds of Asian cat.  Derived from the Wichianmat landrace, one of several varieties of cat native to Thailand (formerly known as Siam), the Siamese became one of the most popular breeds in Europe and North America in the 19th century.  The carefully refined modern Siamese is characterized by blue almond-shaped eyes; a triangular head shape; large ears; an elongated, slender, and muscular body; and point colouration.   (Aside from the colouration, it bears little resemblance to the original stock, and the more moderate, traditional or "old-style" Siamese, with a much rounder head and body, has been re-established by multiple registries as the Thai cat. 

Speculation<====>63088<====>Speculation   Speculation is the purchase of an asset (a commodity, goods, or real estate) with the hope that it will become more valuable at a future date.

The optic chiasm is found in all vertebrates, although in cyclostomes (lampreys and hagfishes) it is located within the brain.  StructureThe optic nerve fibres on the nasal sides of each retina cross over (decussate) to the opposite side of the brain via the optic nerve at the optic chiasm (decussation of medial fibers). 

Ishmael (novel)<====>63099<====>Ishmael (novel)   Ishmael is a 1992 philosophical novel by Daniel Quinn.   It examines the mythological thinking at the heart of modern civilization, its effect on ethics, and how this relates to sustainability and societal collapse on the global scale.

Modal jazz<====>63106<====>Modal jazz Modal jazz is jazz that uses musical modes rather than chord progressions as a harmonic framework.  Though earlier precedents exist, modal jazz was crystallized as a distinct theory by composer George Russell in his 1953 book Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization.  Particularly popular in the 1950s and 1960s, modal jazz is epitomized by Miles Davis's 1958 composition "Milestones", 1959 album Kind of Blue, and John Coltrane's classic quartet from 1960–64, Henry Martin, Keith Waters (2008).  Essential Jazz: The First 100 Years, p. 178-79.   .   both of which were directly inspired by Russell. 

Post-rock<====>63109<====>Post-rock Post-rock is a form of experimental rock  characterized by use of rock instruments to create "timbre and textures" in place of drive and power via chords and riffs.    Post-rock bands are often instrumental.  Although firmly rooted in the indie or underground scene of the 1980s and early 1990s, post-rock's style often bears little resemblance musically to that of contemporary indie rock.

Clap skate<====>63126<====>Clap skateThe clap skate (also called clapskates, slap skates, slapskates, from Dutch  ) is a type of ice skate used in speed skating.   Unlike in traditional skates where the blade is rigidly fixed to the boot, clap skates have the blade attached to the boot by a hinge at the front.  This allows the blade to remain in contact with the ice longer, as the ankle can now be extended toward the end of the stroke, as well as for more natural movement, thereby distributing the energy of the leg more effectively and efficiently. Clap skates were developed at the Faculty of Human Movement Sciences of the Vrije Universiteit of Amsterdam, led by Gerrit Jan van Ingen Schenau, although the idea of a clap skate is much older; designs dating from around 1900 are known.

Symbol (chemistry)<====>63243<====>Symbol (chemistry)In relation to the chemical elements, a symbol is a code for a chemical element.  This should not be confused with formula.  When a number is present at the bottom right corner of the symbol of the element, only then is it said to be a formula, but if the number is not present, it is a symbol.   Many functional groups has their own chemical symbol, e. g.  Ph for the phenyl group, and Me for the methyl group.  Chemical symbols for elements normally consist of one or two letters from the Latin alphabet, but can contain three when the element has a systematic temporary name (as of March 2017, no discovered elements have such a name), and are written with the first letter capitalized. 

Pilcrow<====>63249<====>Pilcrow   The pilcrow (¶), also called the paragraph mark, paragraph sign, paraph, alinea (Latin: a lineā, "off the line"), or blind P,    is a typographical character for individual paragraphs.  It is present in Unicode as  . The pilcrow can be used as an indent for separate paragraphs or to designate a new paragraph in one long piece of copy, as Eric Gill did in his 1930s book, An Essay on Typography.  The pilcrow was a type of rubrication used in the Middle Ages to mark a new train of thought, before the convention of visually discrete paragraphs was commonplace. 

Geology of Victoria<====>63251<====>Geology of VictoriaVictoria is an Australian state, situated at the southern end of the Great Dividing Range.  The Great Dividing Range stretches along the east coast of the continent and terminates near the Victorian city of Ballarat west of the capital Melbourne, though the nearby Grampians may be considered to be the final part of the range.  The highest mountains in Victoria (just under 2,000 m) are the Victorian Alps, located in the northeast of the state. The northwest of the state is mostly Cainozoic rocks while the southeast is primarily made up of Palaeozoic rocks. There have been no discoveries of Precambrian rocks in Victoria. 

Cornish Rex<====>63258<====>Cornish Rex  A Cornish Rex is a breed of domestic cat.  The Cornish Rex has no hair except for down.  Most breeds of cat have three different types of hair in their coats: the outer fur or "guard hairs", a middle layer called the "awn hair"; and the down hair or undercoat, which is very fine and about 1 cm long.  Cornish Rexes only have the undercoat.  Cornish Rex are prone to hair loss and many will develop a very thin coat or even go bald over large parts of their body.  The curl in Cornish Rex fur is caused by a different mutation and gene than that of the Devon Rex. 

Financial economics<====>63262<====>Financial economics  Financial economics is the branch of economics characterized by a "concentration on monetary activities", in which "money of one type or another is likely to appear on both sides of a trade".  William F.  Sharpe, "Financial Economics", in    Its concern is thus the interrelation of financial variables, such as prices, interest rates and shares, as opposed to those concerning the real economy.  It has two main areas of focus: Merton H.  Miller,  (1999).   The History of Finance: An Eyewitness Account, Journal of Portfolio Management.  Summer 1999. 

Evolution of flagella<====>63263<====>Evolution of flagella  The evolution of flagella is of great interest to biologists because the three known varieties of flagella (eukaryotic, bacterial, and archaeal) each represent a sophisticated cellular structure that requires the interaction of many different systems. Eukaryotic flagellumThere are two competing groups of models for the evolutionary origin of the eukaryotic flagellum (referred to as cilium below to distinguish it from its bacterial counterpart).  Recent studies on the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) suggest that the most recent ancestor of all eukaryotes already had a complex flagellar apparatus.  Yubuki, N. , & Leander, B.  S.

Big band<====>63276<====>Big band  A big band is a type of musical ensemble that usually consists of ten or more musicians with four sections: saxophones, trumpets, trombones, and a rhythm section.  Big bands originated during the early 1910s and dominated jazz in the early 1940s when swing was most popular.  The term "big band" is also used to describe a genre of music.  One problem with this usage is that it overlooks the variety of music played by these bands. Big bands started as accompaniment for dancing.  In contrast with the emphasis on improvisation, big bands relied on written compositions and arrangements.

JPEG 2000<====>63285<====>JPEG 2000  JPEG 2000 (JP2) is an image compression standard and coding system.  It was created by the Joint Photographic Experts Group committee in 2000 with the intention of superseding their original discrete cosine transform-based JPEG standard (created in 1992) with a newly designed, wavelet-based method.  The standardized filename extension is . jp2 for ISO/IEC 15444-1 conforming files and . jpx for the extended part-2 specifications, published as ISO/IEC 15444-2.  The registered MIME types are defined in RFC 3745.  For ISO/IEC 15444-1 it is image/jp2. JPEG 2000 code streams are regions of interest that offer several mechanisms to support spatial random access or region of interest access at varying degrees of granularity.

Railway Mania<====>63330<====>Railway Mania  Railway Mania was an instance of speculative frenzy in Britain in the 1840s.  It followed a common pattern: as the price of railway shares increased, more and more money was poured in by speculators until the inevitable collapse.  It reached its zenith in 1846, when no fewer than 272 Acts of Parliament were passed, setting up new railway companies, and the proposed routes totalled   of new railway.  Around a third of the railways authorised were never built – the companies either collapsed due to poor financial planning, were bought out by larger competitors before they could build their line, or turned out to be fraudulent enterprises to channel investors' money into other businesses.

Ineffability<====>63334<====>Ineffability Ineffability is concerned with ideas that cannot or should not be expressed in spoken words (or language in general), often being in the form of a taboo or incomprehensible term.  This property is commonly associated with philosophy, aspects of existence, and similar concepts that are inherently "too great", complex, or abstract to be adequately communicated.  In addition, illogical statements, principles, reasons, and arguments may be considered intrinsically ineffable along with impossibilities, contradictions, and paradoxes.  Terminology describing the nature of experience cannot be properly conveyed in dualistic symbolic language; it is believed that this knowledge is only held by the individual from which it originates.

Completed and published in 1953, Childhood's End sold out its first printing, received good reviews, and became Clarke's first successful novel. 

Supersaturation<====>63337<====>Supersaturation Supersaturation is a state of a solution that contains more of the dissolved material than could be dissolved by the solvent under normal circumstances.  It can also refer to a vapor of a compound that has a higher (partial) pressure than the vapor pressure of that compound. Preparation Special conditions need to be met in order to generate a supersaturated solution.  One of the easiest ways to do this relies on the temperature dependence of solubility.  As a general rule, the more heat is added to a system, the more soluble a substance becomes.  (There are exceptions where the opposite is true). 

Doge of Venice<====>63340<====>Doge of Venice  The Doge of Venice ( ;;    ; all derived from Latin  , "military leader"), sometimes translated as Duke (compare the Italian  ), was the chief magistrate and leader of the Most Serene Republic of Venice for 1,100 years (697-1797).

They primarily feed on seeds, fruits, and plants.  This family occurs worldwide, but the greatest variety is in the Indomalaya and Australasia ecozones.  Pigeons and doves are likely the most common birds in the world. The distinction between "doves" and "pigeons" is not consistent.

Contemporary art<====>63380<====>Contemporary art  Contemporary art is the art of today, produced in the late 20th century or in the 21st century.  Contemporary artists work in a globally influenced, culturally diverse, and technologically advancing world.  Their art is a dynamic combination of materials, methods, concepts, and subjects that challenge traditional boundaries and defy easy definition.  Diverse and eclectic, contemporary art as a whole is distinguished by the very lack of a uniform, organising principle, ideology, or ‘ism. ’ Contemporary art is part of a cultural dialogue that concerns larger contextual frameworks such as personal and cultural identity, family, community, and nationality. 

Rambling Syd Rumpo<====>63381<====>Rambling Syd RumpoRambling Syd Rumpo was a folk singer character, played by the English comedian and actor Kenneth Williams, originally in the 1960s BBC Radio comedy series Round the Horne.    HistoryThe Rambling Syd sketches generally began with a short discourse on the nature of the song, which would inexorably follow; these discourses and the songs involved suggestivity and double entendre.  For this, Rambling Syd was customarily introduced by Kenneth Horne, who would set things up by (for example) inquiring as to the nature and origin of the song.  Rambling Syd would (usually) respond with an "Ullo, mi dearios", before launching into the ensuing detailed explanation which left a great deal to the imagination.

Consensus reality<====>63392<====>Consensus reality Consensus reality   is that which is generally agreed to be reality, based on a consensus view. The appeal to consensus arises from the fact that humans do not fully understand or agree upon the nature of knowledge or ontology, often making it uncertain what is real, given the vast inconsistencies between individual subjectivities.    We can, however, seek to obtain some form of consensus, with others, of what is real.  We can use this consensus as a pragmatic guide, either on the assumption that it seems to approximate some kind of valid reality, or simply because it is more "practical" than perceived alternatives. 

Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria<====>63393<====>Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria  Maximilian II (11 July 1662 – 26 February 1726), also known as Max Emanuel or Maximilian Emanuel,  was a Wittelsbach ruler of Bavaria and a Prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire.  He was also the last governor of the Spanish Netherlands and duke of Luxembourg.  An able soldier, his ambition led to conflicts that limited his ultimate dynastic achievements.

His maternal grandparents were Victor Amadeus I of Savoy and Christine Marie of France, daughter of King Henri IV. 

Bacon<====>63394<====>Bacon   Bacon is a type of salt-cured pork.Bacon is prepared from several different cuts of meat, typically from the pork belly or from back cuts, which has less fat than the belly.  It is eaten on its own, as a side dish (particularly in breakfasts), or used as a minor ingredient to flavour dishes (e. g. , the club sandwich).  Bacon is also used for barding and larding roasts, especially game, including venison and pheasant.  The word is derived from the Old High German bacho, meaning "buttock", "ham" or "side of bacon", and is cognate with the Old French bacon. 

Mean time between failures<====>63397<====>Mean time between failures Mean time between failures (MTBF) is the predicted elapsed time between inherent failures of a mechanical system, during normal system operation.   MTBF can be calculated as the arithmetic mean (average) time between failures of a system.  The term is used in both plant and equipment maintenance contexts. The definition of MTBF depends on the definition of what is considered a mechanical  failure.  For complex, repairable systems, failures are considered to be those out of design conditions which place the system out of service and into a state for repair.  Failures which occur that can be left or maintained in an unrepaired condition, and do not place the system out of service, are not considered failures under this definition.

The abbey is a Grade I listed building owned by the National Trust and part of the designated Studley Royal Park including the Ruins of Fountains Abbey UNESCO World Heritage Site. FoundationAfter a dispute and riot in 1132 at the Benedictine house of St Mary's Abbey, in York, 13 monks were expelled (among them Saint Robert of Newminster) and, after unsuccessful attempts to form a new monastery were taken under  the protection of Thurstan, Archbishop of York. 

MOS Technology 6507<====>63420<====>MOS Technology 6507 The 6507 is an 8-bit microprocessor from MOS Technology, Inc. It is essentially a 6502 chip in a smaller, cheaper 28-pin package.  To do this, A15 to A13 and some other signals such as the interrupt lines are not accessible.  As a result, it can only address 8 KB of memory, which for some applications at the time (1975) was acceptable and not overly restrictive.  The entire 65xx CPU family was originally conceived as a line of very low-cost microprocessors for small-scale embedded systems, not general-purpose computers and certainly not interactive personal computers (which did not generally exist yet). 

The Little Prince<====>63425<====>The Little Prince   The Little Prince (French: Le Petit Prince;  ), first published in 1943, is a novella, the most famous work of French aristocrat, writer, poet, and pioneering aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.

Atari 8-bit family<====>63429<====>Atari 8-bit family  The Atari 8-bit family is a series of 8-bit home computers introduced by Atari, Inc.  in 1979   and manufactured until 1992.  All of the machines in the family are technically similar and differ primarily in packaging.  They are based on the MOS Technology 6502 CPU running at 1. 79 MHz,  and were the first home computers designed with custom co-processor chips.  This architecture enabled graphics and sound capabilities that were more advanced than contemporary machines like the Apple II or Commodore PET, and gaming on the platform was a major draw.

DevelopmentThe Book of Lost TalesIn The Book of Lost Tales the very few Dwarves who appear are portrayed as evil beings, employers of Orc mercenaries and in conflict with the Elves—who are the imagined "authors" of the myths, and are therefore biased against Dwarves. 

Heuristic<====>63452<====>Heuristic A heuristic technique ( ;  , "find" or "discover"), often called simply a heuristic, is any approach to problem solving, learning, or discovery that employs a practical method not guaranteed to be optimal or perfect, but sufficient for the immediate goals.  Where finding an optimal solution is impossible or impractical, heuristic methods can be used to speed up the process of finding a satisfactory solution.  Heuristics can be mental shortcuts that ease the cognitive load of making a decision.  Examples of this method include using a rule of thumb, an educated guess, an intuitive judgment, guesstimate, stereotyping, profiling, or common sense.

The realm is of significant importance in the author's book, The Lord of the Rings.  Much of the background of Rohan is grounded in Anglo-Saxon tradition. 

Discrete element method<====>63473<====>Discrete element methodA discrete element method (DEM), also called a distinct element method, is any of a family of numerical methods for computing the motion and effect of a large number of small particles.  Though DEM is very closely related to molecular dynamics, the method is generally distinguished by its inclusion of rotational degrees-of-freedom as well as stateful contact and often complicated geometries (including polyhedra).  With advances in computing power and numerical algorithms for nearest neighbor sorting, it has become possible to numerically simulate millions of particles on a single processor.  Today DEM is becoming widely accepted as an effective method of addressing engineering problems in granular and discontinuous materials, especially in granular flows, powder mechanics, and rock mechanics. 

Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code<====>63474<====>Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code  Chapter 7 of the Title 11 of the United States Code (Bankruptcy Code) governs the process of liquidation under the bankruptcy laws of the United States (in contrast, Chapters 11 and 13 govern the process of reorganization of a debtor in bankruptcy).

For businessesWhen a troubled business is unable to pay its creditors, it may file (or be forced by its creditors to file) for bankruptcy in a federal court under Chapter 7.  A Chapter 7 filing means that the business ceases operations unless those operations are continued by the Chapter 7 Trustee. 

King's Highway (Charleston to Boston)<====>63475<====>King's Highway (Charleston to Boston) The King's Highway was a roughly   road laid out from 1650 to 1735 in the American colonies.  It was built on the order of Charles II of England, who directed his colonial governors to link Charleston, South Carolina, and Boston, Massachusetts. The section north of New York City, laid out on January 22, 1673, became the Upper Boston Post Road.   The road was finally completed in 1735. From Virginia southward, the modern U. S.  17 has many segments that follow the old King's Highway.

Show cat<====>63484<====>Show cat A show cat (also known as a purebred cat or pedigreed cat) is one that has been judged to be close to the physical ideal for its breed standard at a cat show.  Not all pedigreed cats are show cats, many are just pets but the ones with the best conformation and personality are often shown in associations such as the CFA and TICA in the US, the GCCF in the UK or the FiFe in the rest of Europe.  Uncommonly, a prize-winning pedigreed show cat can be worth thousands of dollars but most are loved pets. 

Bill James<====>63491<====>Bill James   George William James (born October 5, 1949) is an American baseball writer, historian, and statistician whose work has been widely influential.   Since 1977, James has written more than two dozen books devoted to baseball history and statistics.  His approach, which he termed sabermetrics in reference to the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR),  scientifically analyzes and studies baseball, often through the use of statistical data, in an attempt to determine why teams win and lose.

Route 1 (US 1) along the shore via Providence, Rhode Island), the Upper Post Road (now US 5 and US 20 from New Haven, Connecticut by way of Springfield, Massachusetts), and the Middle Post Road (which diverged from the Upper Road in Hartford, Connecticut and ran northeastward to Boston via Pomfret, Connecticut). In some towns, the area near the Boston Post Road has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places, since it was often the first road in the area, and some buildings of historical significance were built along it. 

Paragliding<====>63501<====>ParaglidingParagliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.   The pilot sits in a harness suspended below a fabric wing.   Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside. Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometers, though flights of one to two hours and covering some tens of kilometers are more the norm. 

Duluth, Minnesota<====>63503<====>Duluth, Minnesota   Duluth   is a major port city in the U. S.  state of Minnesota and the county seat of Saint Louis County.  Duluth has a population of 86,293    and is the second-largest city on Lake Superior's shores, after Thunder Bay, Ontario, in Canada; it has the largest metropolitan area on the lake.  The Duluth MSA had a population of 279,771 in 2010, the second-largest in Minnesota. Situated on the north shore of Lake Superior at the westernmost point of the Great Lakes, Duluth is accessible to oceangoing vessels from the Atlantic Ocean   away via the Great Lakes Waterway and the Saint Lawrence Seaway. 

Touch of Evil<====>63504<====>Touch of Evil  Touch of Evil is a 1958 film noir written, directed by, and co-starring Orson Welles.  The screenplay was loosely based on the novel Badge of Evil by Whit Masterson.  Along with Welles, the cast includes Charlton Heston, Janet Leigh, Joseph Calleia, Akim Tamiroff, and Marlene Dietrich. Touch of Evil is one of the last examples of film noir in the genre's classic era (from the early 1940s until the late 1950s).   Since its release, the film's reputation has grown, and it is now widely regarded as one of Welles' best films, and also one of the best classic-era films noir.

Crohn's disease<====>63522<====>Crohn's diseaseCrohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus.   Signs and symptoms often include abdominal pain, diarrhea (which may be bloody if inflammation is severe), fever, and weight loss.    Other complications may occur outside the gastrointestinal tract and include anemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, and tiredness.   The skin rashes may be due to infections as well as pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum.   Bowel obstruction also commonly occurs and those with the disease are at greater risk of bowel cancer. 

Sissy Spacek<====>63523<====>Sissy Spacek Mary Elizabeth "Sissy" Spacek ( ; born December 25, 1949) is an American actress and singer.  She began her career in the early 1970s and first gained attention for her role in the film Badlands (1973).  Her major breakthrough came in 1976 when she played the title character of Carrie White in Brian De Palma's horror film Carrie, based on the first novel by Stephen King, for which she earned an Oscar nomination (a rare feat for an actor or actress in a horror movie).  She won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Loretta Lynn in the 1980 film Coal Miner's Daughter, and also earned a Grammy nomination for the song "Coal Miner's Daughter" from the film's soundtrack. 

Tiltrotor<====>63525<====>TiltrotorA tiltrotor is an aircraft which generates lift and propulsion by way of one or more powered rotors (sometimes called proprotors) mounted on rotating engine pods or nacelles usually at the ends of a fixed wing or an engine mounted in the fuselage with drive shafts transferring power to rotor assemblies mounted on the wingtips.  It combines the vertical lift capability of a helicopter with the speed and range of a conventional fixed-wing aircraft.  For vertical flight, the rotors are angled so the plane of rotation is horizontal, lifting the way a helicopter rotor does.  As the aircraft gains speed, the rotors are progressively tilted forward, with the plane of rotation eventually becoming vertical. 

Coeliac disease<====>63526<====>Coeliac disease   Coeliac disease, also spelled celiac disease, is a long-term autoimmune disorder primarily affecting the small intestine that occurs in people who are genetically predisposed.Classic symptoms include gastrointestinal problems such as chronic diarrhoea, abdominal distention, malabsorption, loss of appetite, and among children failure to grow normally.   This often begins between six months and two years of age.   Non-classic symptoms are more common, especially in people older than two years.   There may be mild or absent gastrointestinal symptoms, a wide number of symptoms involving any part of the body, or no obvious symptoms. 

Claude Rains<====>63527<====>Claude Rains   William Claude Rains (10 November 1889 30 May 1967) was an English film and stage actor whose career spanned 46 years.

He was a Tony Award winning actor and was a four-time nominee for the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award, but never won.  Rains was considered to be "one of the screen's great character stars"   From McFarlane's Encyclopedia of British Film, London: Methuen/BFI, 2003, p. 

Inflorescence<====>63528<====>Inflorescence An inflorescence is a group or cluster of flowers arranged on a stem that is composed of a main branch or a complicated arrangement of branches.  Morphologically, it is the modified part of the shoot of seed plants where flowers are formed.  The modifications can involve the length and the nature of the internodes and the phyllotaxis, as well as variations in the proportions, compressions, swellings, adnations, connations and reduction of main and secondary axes. Inflorescence can also be defined as the reproductive portion of a plant that bears a cluster of flowers in a specific pattern. 

Ulcerative colitis<====>63531<====>Ulcerative colitis   Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a long-term condition that results in inflammation and ulcers of the colon and rectum.   The primary symptom of active disease is abdominal pain and diarrhea mixed with blood.   Weight loss, fever, and anemia may also occur.   Often symptoms come on slowly and can range from mild to severe.   Symptoms typically occur intermittently with periods of no symptoms between flares.   Complications may include megacolon, inflammation of the eye, joints, or liver, and colon cancer. The cause of UC is unknown. 

Lutefisk<====>63532<====>Lutefisk  Lutefisk (Norwegian) or lutfisk (Swedish) (pronounced   in Northern and Central Norway,   in Southern Norway,   in Sweden and in Finland ( )) is a traditional dish of some Nordic countries.  It is traditionally part of the Norwegian julebord and Swedish julbord.  It is made from aged stockfish (air-dried whitefish) or dried/salted whitefish (klippfisk) and lye (lut).  It is gelatinous in texture.   Its name literally means "lye fish". Preparation Lutefisk is dried whitefish (normally cod, but ling and burbot are also used) treated with lye.  The first step is soaking the stockfish in cold water for five to six days (with the water changed daily). 

Greer Garson<====>63534<====>Greer Garson    Eileen Evelyn Greer Garson, CBE (29 September 1904 – 6 April 1996) was a British-American actress popular during the Second World War, being listed by the Motion Picture Herald as one of America's top-ten box office draws from 1942 to 1946.    A major star at MGM during the 1940s, Garson received seven Academy Award nominations, including a record five consecutive nominations, winning the Best Actress award for Mrs.  Miniver (1942).

Alanine<====>63539<====>Alanine Alanine (abbreviated as Ala or A) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins.  It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated form, −NH3 + , under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated form, −COO − , under biological conditions), and a side chain methyl group, making it a nonpolar, aliphatic amino acid.  It is non-essential in humans: because the body can synthesize it, it does not need to be present in the diet.  It is one of the 20 amino acids encoded by the human genetic code, and is encoded by all codons starting with GC, namely GCU, GCC, GCA, and GCG. 

Aspartic acid<====>63540<====>Aspartic acid Aspartic acid (abbreviated as Asp or D; encoded by the codons [GAU and GAC]), also known as aspartate, is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins.Similar to all other amino acids it contains an amino group and a carboxylic acid.  Its α-amino group is in the protonated –NH  form under physiological conditions, while its α-carboxylic acid group is deprotonated −COO −  under physiological conditions.  Aspartic acid has an acidic side chain (CH 2 COOH) which reacts with other amino acids, enzymes and proteins in the body. 

Glutamic acid<====>63541<====>Glutamic acid  Glutamic acid is an α-amino acid with formula  .    It is usually abbreviated as Glu or E in biochemistry.  Its molecular structure could be idealized as HOOC-CH( )-( ) 2 -COOH, with two carboxyl groups -COOH and one amino group - .   However, in the solid state and mildly acid water solutions, the molecule assumes an electrically neutral zwitterion structure  − OOC-CH( )-( ) 2 -COOH. The acid can lose one proton from its second carboxyl group to form the conjugate acid, the singly-negative anion glutamate  − OOC-CH( )-( ) 2 -COO − . 

Histidine<====>63542<====>Histidine Histidine (abbreviated as His or H; encoded by the codons CAU and CAC) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins.  It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated –NH 3  +  form under biological conditions), a carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated –COO −  form under biological conditions), and an imidazole side chain (which is partially protonated), classifying it as a positively charged amino acid at physiological pH.  Initially thought essential only for infants, longer-term studies have shown it is essential for adults also.  Histidine was first isolated by German physician Albrecht Kossel and Sven Hedin in 1896. 

Isoleucine<====>63543<====>Isoleucine Isoleucine (abbreviated as Ile or I), encoded by the codons ATT, ATC, ATA Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, University of Denmark   , is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins.  It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH  form under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated −COO  form under biological conditions), and a hydrocarbon side chain, classifying it as a non-polar, uncharged (at physiological pH), aliphatic amino acid.  It is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it, and must be ingested in our diet. 

Lysine<====>63544<====>Lysine Lysine (abbreviated as Lys or K),  encoded by the codons AAA and AAG, is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins.  It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH 3  +  form under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated −COO −  form under biological conditions), and a side chain lysyl ((CH 2 ) 4 NH 2 ), classifying it as a charged (at physiological pH), aliphatic amino acid.  It is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it and thus it must be obtained from the diet. 

Leucine<====>63546<====>Leucine  Leucine (abbreviated as Leu or L) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins.  It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH 3  +  form under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated −COO −  form under biological conditions), and a side chain isobutyl group, making it a non-polar aliphatic amino acid.  It is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it: it must be obtained from the diet.  Human dietary sources are foods that contain protein, such as meats, dairy products, soy products, beans and legumes. 

Pancreatitis<====>63547<====>Pancreatitis  Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas.   The pancreas is a large organ behind the stomach that produces digestive enzymes and a number of hormones.   There are two main types, acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis.   Signs and symptoms of pancreatitis include pain in the upper abdomen, nausea and vomiting.   The pain often goes into the back and is usually severe.   In acute pancreatitis a fever may occur and symptoms typically resolve in a few days.   In chronic pancreatitis weight loss, fatty stool, and diarrhea may occur.   Complications may include infection, bleeding, diabetes mellitus, or problems with other organs. 

Asparagine<====>63548<====>Asparagine  Asparagine (abbreviated as Asn or N), encoded by the codons  AAU and AAC,  is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins.  It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH  form under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated −COO −  form under biological conditions), and a side chain carboxamide, classifying it as a polar (at physiological pH), aliphatic amino acid.  It is non-essential in humans, meaning the body can synthesize it. A reaction between asparagine and reducing sugars or other source of carbonyls produces acrylamide in food when heated to sufficient temperature. 

Glutamine<====>63549<====>Glutamine  Glutamine (abbreviated as Gln or Q; encoded by the codons CAA and CAG) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins.   It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH 2  +  form under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated −COO −  form, known as carboxylate, under physiological conditions), and a side chain amide which replaces the carboxylic acid side chain of glutamic acid, classifying it as a charge neutral (at physiological pH), polar amino acid.   It is non-essential and conditionally essential in humans, meaning the body can usually synthesize sufficient amounts of it, but in some instances of stress, the body's demand for glutamine increases, and glutamine must be obtained from the diet. 

Arginine<====>63550<====>Arginine Arginine (abbreviated as Arg or R) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins.  It is encoded by the codons CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA, and AGG.   It contains an α-amino group, an α-carboxylic acid group, and a side chain consisting of a 3-carbon aliphatic straight chain ending in a guanidino group.  At physiological pH, the carboxylic acid is deprotonated (−COO − ), the amino group is protonated (−NH 3  + ), and the guanidino group is also protonated to give the guanidinium form (-C-(NH 2 ) 2  + ), making arginine a charged, aliphatic amino acid. 

Serine<====>63551<====>Serine   Serine (abbreviated as Ser or S)  encoded by the codons UCU, UCC, UCA, UCG, AGU and AGC is an ɑ-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins.  It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −  form under biological conditions), a carboxyl group (which is in the deprotonated –  form in physiological conditions), and a side chain consisting of a hydroxymethyl group (see hydroxyl), classifying it as a polar amino acid.  It can be synthesized in the human body under normal physiological circumstances, making it a nonessential amino acid. 

Amylase<====>63552<====>AmylaseAn amylase ( ) is an enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of starch into sugars.  Amylase is present in the saliva of humans and some other mammals, where it begins the chemical process of digestion.  Foods that contain large amounts of starch but little sugar, such as rice and potatoes, may acquire a slightly sweet taste as they are chewed because amylase degrades some of their starch into sugar.  The pancreas and salivary gland make amylase (alpha amylase) to hydrolyse dietary starch into disaccharides and trisaccharides which are converted by other enzymes to glucose to supply the body with energy. 

Threonine<====>63553<====>Threonine Threonine (abbreviated as Thr or T) is an amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins.  It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH  form under biological conditions), a carboxyl group (which is in the deprotonated −COO −  form under biological conditions), and a side chain containing a hydroxyl group, making it a polar, uncharged amino acid.  It is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it: it must be obtained from the diet.  Threonine is synthesized from aspartate in bacteria such as E.  coli.   In the genetic code it is encoded by the codons ACU, ACC, ACA, and ACG. 

Valine<====>63554<====>Valine Valine (abbreviated as Val or V) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins.  It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH 3  +  form under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated −COO −  form under biological conditions), and a side chain isopropyl group, making it a non-polar aliphatic amino acid.  It is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it: it must be obtained from the diet.  Human dietary sources are foods that contain protein, such as meats, dairy products, soy products, beans and legumes. 

Fredric March<====>63556<====>Fredric March  Fredric March (born Ernest Frederick McIntyre Bickel; August 31, 1897 – April 14, 1975) was a "distinguished stage actor and one of Hollywood's most celebrated, versatile stars of the 1930s and 40s. "  Obituary Variety, April 16, 1975, page 95.

March is the only actor to have won both the Academy Award and the Tony Award twice. 

Amateur telescope making<====>63557<====>Amateur telescope making Amateur telescope making is the activity of building telescopes as a hobby, as opposed to being a paid professional.  Amateur telescope makers (sometimes called ATMs) build their instruments for personal enjoyment of a technical challenge, as a way to obtain an inexpensive or personally customized telescope, or as a research tool in the field of astronomy.  Amateur telescope makers are usually a sub-group in the field of amateur astronomy. BeginningsEver since Galileo took a Dutch invention and adapted it to astronomical use, astronomical telescope making has been an evolving discipline.  Many astronomers after the time of Galileo built their own telescopes out of necessity, but the advent of amateurs in the field building telescopes for their own enjoyment and education seems to have come into prominence in the 20th century. 

Anatomical pathology<====>63563<====>Anatomical pathology Anatomical pathology (Commonwealth) or Anatomic pathology (U. S. ) is a medical specialty that is concerned with the diagnosis of disease based on the macroscopic, microscopic, biochemical, immunologic and molecular examination of organs and tissues.  Over the last century, surgical pathology has evolved tremendously: from historical examination of whole bodies (autopsy) to a more modernized practice, centered on the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer to guide treatment decision-making in oncology.  Its modern founder was the Italian scientist Giovan Battista Morgagni from Forlì. Anatomical pathology is one of two branches of pathology, the other being clinical pathology, the diagnosis of disease through the laboratory analysis of bodily fluids and/or tissues. 

Hematology<====>63564<====>Hematology  Hematology, also spelled haematology, is the branch of medicine concerned with the study of the cause, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases related to blood.   It involves treating diseases that affect the production of blood and its components, such as blood cells, hemoglobin, blood proteins, bone marrow, platelets, blood vessels, spleen, and the mechanism of coagulation.  Such diseases might include hemophilia, blood clots, other bleeding disorders and blood cancers such as leukemia, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma.  The laboratory work that goes into the study of blood is frequently performed by a medical technologist or medical laboratory scientist. 

Forensic pathology<====>63565<====>Forensic pathology Forensic pathology is pathology that focuses on determining the cause of death by examining a corpse.  A post mortem is performed by a medical examiner, usually during the investigation of criminal law cases and civil law cases in some jurisdictions.  Coroners and medical examiners are also frequently asked to confirm the identity of a corpse.  Also see forensic medicine. DutiesForensic pathology is an application of medical jurisprudence.  A forensic pathologist is a medical doctor who has completed training in anatomical pathology and has subsequently specialized in forensic pathology.  The requirements for becoming a "fully qualified" forensic pathologist vary from country to country.

QuickBASIC<====>63569<====>QuickBASIC  Microsoft QuickBASIC (also QB) is an Integrated Development Environment (or IDE) and compiler for the BASIC programming language that was developed by Microsoft.  QuickBASIC runs mainly on DOS, though there was a short-lived version for the classic Mac OS.  It is loosely based on GW-BASIC but adds user-defined types, improved programming structures, better graphics and disk support and a compiler in addition to the interpreter.   Microsoft marketed QuickBASIC as the introductory level for their BASIC Professional Development System.    Microsoft marketed two other similar IDEs for C and Pascal, viz QuickC and QuickPascal. 

Grouse<====>63570<====>Grouse  Grouse   are a group of birds from the order Galliformes, in the family Phasianidae.  Grouse are frequently assigned to the subfamily Tetraoninae (sometimes Tetraonidae), a classification supported by mitochondrial DNA sequence studies,  and applied by the American Ornithologists' Union,  ITIS,  and others.   Grouse inhabit temperate and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, from pine forests to moorland and mountainside,  from 83°N (rock ptarmigan in northern Greenland) to 28°N (Attwater's prairie chicken in Texas).  DescriptionGrouse are heavily built like other Galliformes such as chickens.   They range in length from  , and in weight from  . 

Sparrow<====>63572<====>Sparrow  Sparrows are a family of small passerine birds.  They are also known as true sparrows, or Old World sparrows, names also used for a particular genus of the family, Passer.   They are distinct from both the American sparrows, in the family Passerellidae, and from a few other birds sharing their name, such as the Java sparrow of the family Estrildidae.  Many species nest on buildings and the house and Eurasian tree sparrows, in particular, inhabit cities in large numbers, so sparrows are among the most familiar of all wild birds.  They are primarily seed-eaters, though they also consume small insects. 

Defenestration<====>63573<====>Defenestration Defenestration is the act of throwing someone or something out of a window.  The term was coined around the time of an incident in Prague Castle in the year 1618, which became the spark that started the Thirty Years' War.  This was done in "good Bohemian style" and referred to the defenestration which had occurred in Prague's City Hall almost 200 years earlier (July 1419), which also at that occasion led to war, the Hussite war.   The word comes from the New Latin    (out of or away from) and   (window or opening). 

-logy<====>63574<====>-logy  -logy is a suffix in the English language, used with words originally adapted from Ancient Greek ending in   (-logia).   The earliest English examples were anglicizations of the French  , which was in turn inherited from the Latin  .  The suffix became productive in English from the 18th century, allowing the formation of new terms with no Latin or Greek precedent. The English suffix has two separate main senses, reflecting two sources of the   suffix in Greek: a combining form used in the names of sciences or bodies of knowledge, e.

First Balkenende cabinet<====>63608<====>First Balkenende cabinet  The first cabinet of Jan Peter Balkenende was in office in the Netherlands from 22 July 2002 until 16 October of the same year.  The term of 87 days (counting the first and last days in full and excluding its "caretaker" function that continued for months afterwards) was the shortest since the fifth cabinet of Hendrikus Colijn (25 July 1939 – 10 August 1939).FormationFollowing the 15 May 2002 elections, the division of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives (lower house) was:Christen Democratisch Appèl (CDA)  43 Lijst Pim Fortuyn (LPF)  26 Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie (VVD)  24 Partij van de Arbeid (PvdA)  23 GroenLinks (GL)  10 Socialistische Partij (SP)  9 Democraten 66 (D66)  7 ChristenUnie (CU)  4 Staatkundig Gereformeerde Partij (SGP)  2 Leefbaar Nederland (LN) 2 On 17 May Queen Beatrix appointed Piet Hein Donner, a CDA member of the Raad van State as "informer", to investigate the possibilities for a new government.  A coalition between CDA, LPF and VVD was established relatively quickly, despite some initial resistance by the VVD.  By 4 July a detailed coalition agreement had been drawn up and the Queen appointed Jan Peter Balkenende, the lijsttrekker for the CDA, to form a new cabinet. The cabinet was named on 16 July and was sworn in on 22 July. The first Balkenende cabinet comprised 14 ministers and 14 state secretaries, with each post allocated to one of the coalition parties. Each of the ministers headed a department, with the exception of one "minister without a portfolio" to deal with "foreigners policy and integration", accommodated by the Ministry of Justice.Incidents and ScandalsThe first Balkenende cabinet was very unstable from the beginning. Elections had been held in the very recent aftermath of the assassination of Pim Fortuyn, the leader of the newly established LPF. Emotions in the Netherlands had run very high. The LPF was catapulted into enormous wins, but was  unprepared for cabinet participation.Only three of the 27 cabinet members had previous experience in government, leading to speculation that it wouldn't last long.  As it turned out, personality conflicts and the general inexperience of LPF cabinet members led to the rapid implosion of the cabinet after a little more than two months.Resignation of Undersecretary BijlhoutThe first scandal in the new government came only nine hours after it took office. Philomena Bijlhout, the staatssecretaris (Undersecretary, or junior minister) for Social Affairs and Work Opportunity and a member of the LPF, resigned after RTL 4 reported that she had been a member of a militia of Surinamese military dictator Dési Bouterse in 1982 and 1983.  This was during the period when the militia had committed the political murders known as the "December Murders".  Bijlhout, who was born in Suriname, had never denied being part of the militia, but claimed she'd left prior to the December Murders. Power Struggles within the LPF and the Resignation of the CabinetIn the months following the election, the LPF  was beset by power struggles between various factions. A big incident was when Immigration and Integration Minister Hilbrand Nawijn declared to be in favour of the death penalty. The cabinet was officially opposed to the death penalty. Nawijn responded that he made his remark as leader of the LPF. The party in its turn declared that it was opposed to the death penalty. Nawijn was highly criticised when he declared that it was a personal remark, because it was normal that a minister in a coalition cabinet could make remarks as a party member outside his ministerial responsibility.In September and October Herman Heinsbroek speculated in public about leading a new party and resigning from the government. This led to tension between him and his supporter Steven van Eyck and Bomhoff. VVD-leader Zalm tried to convince the LPF ministers to replace both Bomhoff and Heinsbroek but his real aim was to use these resignations to call for new elections and to repair the huge losses of his VVD party in the election after the murder of Fortuyn. Disregarding Bomhoff's warnings, the other LPF ministers took the bait and told Bomhoff and Heinsbroek to resign, which they did on October 16. Immediately, Zalm broke his commitment to the remaining LPF ministers to accept replacements for Bomhoff and Heinsbroek and called for fresh elections. Meetings with the Queen did not take place until the week after the resignation, since she had travelled to Italy immediately after the funeral. On 21 October she accepted the resignation and new elections were called for 22 January 2003. The cabinet remained in place as a demissionary cabinet, without Bomhoff and Heinsbroek, until the elections and formation of the second Balkenende cabinet.On 12 December 2002, Benk Korthals resigned as caretaker Minister of Defence after a commission of inquiry into building industry fraud accused him of giving false information to the Lower House during the previous cabinet. After resigning he said he still denied the allegations.After the ensuing new elections, the LPF lost two-thirds of its seats in the House of Representatives.  The party was never a significant force in Dutch politics again, and dissolved in 2008.Cabinet actionsRevoking a planned ban on mink farming initiated by the previous cabinet. Approval of an expansion of the European Union.Support for the United States in its plan to invade Iraq.Cuts to Ad Melkert's subsidised jobs scheme, the Melkertbanen.Removal of price controls on certain popular medical interventions (knee and hip operations, cataract operations) in an effort to reduce waiting lists.Reorganisation of defence, including budget cuts and the termination of 4800 jobs. Reduction of spending on public transport by 39 million euros. Cuts to the budgets of most government departments, countered by increased spending in health and some other areas.MinistersPrime Minister, General Affairs (CDA) Jan Peter Balkenende Vice Prime Minister, Health and Sport (LPF) Eduard Bomhoff (resigned 16 October 2002, after which Aart Jan de Geus added this portfolio).

Sauron intended three of the rings to be worn by Elves, Seven by Dwarves, Nine by Men, and one, the One Ring, by the Dark Lord Sauron himself in Mount Doom. Sauron intended the rings to subvert these races of Middle-earth to his power, since the One Ring controlled the others.  Sauron's plan was not completely successful, for the Elves hid their rings and did not use them while Sauron held the One, and the Dwarves did not respond to the One's control as Sauron expected.

Alpha-Methyltryptamine<====>63692<====>Alpha-MethyltryptamineDISPLAYTITLE α-Methyltryptamine (abbreviated as αMT, AMT) is a psychedelic, stimulant, and entactogen drug of the tryptamine class.   It was originally developed as an antidepressant by workers at Upjohn in the 1960s,  and was used briefly as an antidepressant in Russia under the trade name Indopan before being discontinued. ChemistryαMT is tryptamine with a methyl substituent at the alpha carbon.  This alpha substitution makes it a relatively poor substrate for monoamine oxidase A, thereby prolonging αMT's half-life, allowing it to reach the brain and enter the central nervous system.

This term derives its meaning from the Latin   and the Greek   (karpós), both meaning "wrist. " In human anatomy, the main role of the wrist is to facilitate effective positioning of the hand and powerful use of the extensors and flexors of the forearm, and the mobility of individual carpal bones increase the freedom of movements at the wrist.  Kingston 2000, pp 126-127 In tetrapods, the carpus is the sole cluster of bones in the wrist between the radius and ulna and the metacarpus.

During the last seventeen years of his life (1788–1805), Schiller struck up a productive, if complicated, friendship with the already famous and influential Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.  They frequently discussed issues concerning aesthetics, and Schiller encouraged Goethe to finish works he left as sketches.  This relationship and these discussions led to a period now referred to as Weimar Classicism.  They also worked together on Xenien, a collection of short satirical poems in which both Schiller and Goethe challenge opponents to their philosophical vision.

Hawker Typhoon<====>63744<====>Hawker Typhoon   The Hawker Typhoon (Tiffy in RAF slang) is a British single-seat fighter-bomber, produced by Hawker Aircraft.  It was intended to be a medium–high altitude interceptor, as a replacement for the Hawker Hurricane, but several design problems were encountered and it never completely satisfied this requirement.  Thomas and Shores 1988, p.  16.  The Typhoon was originally designed to mount twelve . 303 inch (7. 7 mm) Browning machine guns and be powered by the latest 2000 hp engines.  Its service introduction in mid-1941 was plagued with problems and for several months the aircraft faced a doubtful future.

The Two Towers<====>63750<====>The Two Towers    The Two Towers is the second volume of J.  R.  R.  Tolkien's high fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings.  It is preceded by The Fellowship of the Ring and followed by The Return of the King. TitleThe Lord of the Rings is composed of six "books", aside from an introduction, a prologue and six appendices.  The novel was originally published as three separate volumes due to post-World War II paper shortages and size and price considerations.   The Two Towers covers Books III and IV. Tolkien wrote, "The Two Towers gets as near as possible to finding a title to cover the widely divergent Books 3 and 4; and can be left ambiguous. 

The Return of the King<====>63751<====>The Return of the King    The Return of the King is the third and final volume of J.  R.  R.  Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, following The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers.  The story begins in the kingdom of Gondor, which is soon to be attacked by the Dark Lord Sauron. TitleTolkien conceived of The Lord of the Rings as a single volume comprising six "books" plus extensive appendices.  The original publisher split the work into three volumes, publishing the fifth and sixth books with the appendices into the final volume with the title The Return of the King. 

Cemetery<====>63752<====>Cemetery  A cemetery or graveyard is a place where the remains of dead people are buried or otherwise interred.   The word cemetery (from Greek  , "sleeping place")  implies that the land is specifically designated as a burial ground and originally applied to the Roman underground catacombs.   The term graveyard is often used interchangeably with cemetery, but a graveyard primarily refers to a burial ground within a churchyard.   The intact or cremated remains of people may be interred in a grave, commonly referred to as burial, or in a tomb, an "above-ground grave" (resembling a sarcophagus), a mausoleum, columbarium, niche, or other edifice.

Akallabêth<====>63754<====>Akallabêth   Akallabêth is the fourth part of The Silmarillion, as edited by Christopher Tolkien (1977).  It is a relatively short (about thirty pages long) summary of the Númenor narrative of  J.  R.  R.  Tolkien's legendarium.  Númenor is the name of the island that is cataclysmically destroyed in Tolkien's variant of the Atlantis legend. In Tolkien's invented language  Quenya, Atalantë means "(the) Downfallen".  Tolkien in 1964 described the similarity of the word "Atalantë" to "Atlantis" as a happy coincidence:"It is a curious chance that the stem talat used in Q[uenya] for 'slipping, sliding, falling down', of which atalantie is a normal (in Q) noun-formation, should so much resemble Atlantis. 

Valaquenta<====>63755<====>Valaquenta   Valaquenta (Quenya for "Tale of the Valar") is the second section of The Silmarillion, a collection of J.  R.  R.  Tolkien's mythopoeic works, edited and published posthumously by his son Christopher Tolkien in 1977. OverviewValaquenta provides a middle-ground and link between Ainulindalë, which stands as Middle-earth's cosmogony or 'creation myth', and Quenta Silmarillion, a collection of mythical histories in which major events of Middle-earth find their first elaboration (see The Silmarillion). Not an actual story in itself (there is no plot or action), Valaquenta is more a listing, a kind of expanded footnote giving details about the major divine characters of Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium. 

Numenor<====>63757<====>Numenor

Ainulindalë<====>63758<====>Ainulindalë Ainulindalë ( ; "Music of the Ainur") is the creation account in J.  R.  R.  Tolkien's legendarium, published as the first part of the posthumously published The Silmarillion (1977). In many ways central to Tolkien's "subcreative" cosmology, the Ainulindalë gives an account of the Ainur, a class of angelic beings, who perform a great music prefiguring the creation of the material universe (Eä). Ilúvatar introduces the theme of the sentient races of Elves and Men, not anticipated by the Ainur, and gives physical being to the prefigured universe.  Some of the Ainur decide to enter the physical world to prepare for their arrival, becoming the Valar and Maiar. 

Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age<====>63760<====>Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age  Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age is the fifth and last part of The Silmarillion by J.  R.  R.  Tolkien.  It is relatively short, consisting of about 20 pages.   Tolkien's first draft of this was written before June 1948 as he refers to it in a letter then.  The work is a fictional historical essay dealing with the preamble to the events described in Tolkien's epic novel The Lord of the Rings, and the events themselves, in the style of The Silmarillion. 

The Pale<====>63761<====>The Pale    The Pale (An Pháil in Irish) or the English Pale (  or  ) was the part of Ireland that was directly under the control of the English government in the late Middle Ages.   It had been reduced by the late 15th century to an area along the east coast stretching from Dalkey, south of Dublin, to the garrison town of Dundalk.   The inland boundary went to Naas and Leixlip around the Earldom of Kildare, towards Trim and north towards Kells.  In this district, many townlands have English or French names. 

Solved game<====>63763<====>Solved gameA solved game is a game whose outcome (win, lose or draw) can be correctly predicted from any position, assuming that both players play perfectly. OverviewA two-player game can be "solved" on several levels:    Ultra-weakProve whether the first player will win, lose or draw from the initial position, given perfect play on both sides.  This can be a non-constructive proof (possibly involving a strategy-stealing argument) that need not actually determine any moves of the perfect play. WeakProvide an algorithm that secures a win for one player, or a draw for either, against any possible moves by the opponent, from the beginning of the game. 

Dysentery<====>63764<====>Dysentery   Dysentery is a type of gastroenteritis that results in diarrhea with blood.   Other symptoms may include fever, abdominal pain,  and a feeling of incomplete defecation. It is caused by several types of infections such as bacteria, viruses, parasitic worms, or protozoa.  The mechanism is an inflammatory disorder of the intestine, especially of the colon. Signs and symptomsThe most common form of dysentery is bacillary dysentery, which is typically a mild illness, causing symptoms normally consisting of mild stomach pains and frequent passage of stool or diarrhea.  Symptoms normally present themselves after one to three days, and are usually no longer present after a week. 

Uncertainty<====>63778<====>Uncertainty  Uncertainty has been called "an unintelligible expression without a straightforward description".   It describes a situation involving ambiguous and/or unknown information.  It applies to predictions of future events, to physical measurements that are already made, or to the unknown.  Uncertainty arises in partially observable and/or stochastic environments, as well as due to ignorance, indolence, or both.   It arises in any number of fields, including insurance, philosophy, physics, statistics, economics, finance, psychology, sociology, engineering, metrology, meteorology, and information science. Concepts Although the terms are used in various ways among the general public, many specialists in decision theory, statistics and other quantitative fields have defined uncertainty, risk, and their measurement as:UncertaintyThe lack of certainty, a state of limited knowledge where it is impossible to exactly describe the existing state, a future outcome, or more than one possible outcome. 

Loyalist Volunteer Force<====>63779<====>Loyalist Volunteer Force  The Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) is a small Ulster loyalist paramilitary group in Northern Ireland.  It was formed by Billy Wright in 1996 when he and his unit split from the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) after breaking its ceasefire.  They had belonged to the UVF's Mid-Ulster Brigade and Wright had been the brigade's commander.  In a two-year period from August 1996, the LVF waged a paramilitary campaign with the stated goal of combatting Irish republicanism.  During this time it killed at least 14 people in gun and bomb attacks.  Almost all of its victims were Catholic civilians who were killed at random. 

Sporangium<====>63780<====>SporangiumA sporangium (pl. , sporangia ) (modern Latin, from Greek σπόρος (sporos) ‘spore’ + αγγείον (angeion) ‘vessel’) is an enclosure in which spores are formed.   It can be composed of a single cell or can be multicellular.  All plants, fungi, and many other lineages form sporangia at some point in their life cycle.  Sporangia can produce spores by mitosis, but in nearly all land plants and many fungi, sporangia are the site of meiosis and produce genetically distinct haploid spores. Fungi Structure containing the spores in fungal species. Land plantsIn mosses, liverworts and hornworts, an unbranched sporophyte produces a single sporangium, which may be quite complex morphologically. 

Atlantic League of Professional Baseball<====>63785<====>Atlantic League of Professional Baseball    The Atlantic League of Professional Baseball is a professional, independent baseball league located primarily in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States, especially the greater metropolitan areas of the Northeast megalopolis, with one team located in Texas.   League offices are located in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The Atlantic League operates in cities not served by Major or Minor League Baseball teams and is not affiliated with either; most of its teams are within suburbs and exurbs too close to other teams in the organized baseball system to have minor league franchises of their own. 

Morepork<====>63786<====>Morepork The morepork (Ninox novaeseelandiae), also called the ruru or Tasmanian spotted owl, is a small brown owl found throughout New Zealand and Tasmania.  Described by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1788, it was for many years considered to be the same species (conspecific) as the southern boobook of mainland Australia until 1999.  Its name is derived from its two-tone call.  Four subspecies of the morepork are recognized, one of which has become extinct and another exists only as a hybrid population.  The bird has almost 20 alternative common names, including mopoke and boobook – many of these names are onomatopoeic, as they emulate the bird's distinctive two-pitched call. 

Troubadour<====>63788<====>Troubadour  A troubadour ( ,  ;  ,   ) was a composer and performer of Old Occitan lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages (1100–1350).  Since the word troubadour is etymologically masculine, a female troubadour is usually called a trobairitz. The troubadour school or tradition began in the late 11th century in Occitania, but it subsequently spread to Italy and Spain.  Under the influence of the troubadours, related movements sprang up throughout Europe: the Minnesang in Germany, trovadorismo in Galicia and Portugal, and that of the trouvères in northern France.  Dante Alighieri in his De vulgari eloquentia defined the troubadour lyric as fictio rethorica musicaque poita: rhetorical, musical, and poetical fiction. 

Bacteriocin<====>63790<====>Bacteriocin  Bacteriocins are proteinaceous or peptidic toxins produced by bacteria to inhibit the growth of similar or closely related bacterial strain(s).  They are similar to yeast and paramecium killing factors, and are structurally, functionally, and ecologically diverse.  Applications of bacteriocins are being tested to assess their application as narrow-spectrum antibiotics.    Bacteriocins were first discovered by André Gratia in 1925.He was involved in the process of searching for ways to kill bacteria, which also resulted in the development of antibiotics and the discovery of bacteriophage, all within a span of a few years. 

Peptic ulcer disease<====>63791<====>Peptic ulcer disease  Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is a break in the lining of the stomach, first part of the small intestine or occasionally the lower esophagus. An ulcer in the stomach is known as a gastric ulcer while that in the first part of the intestines is known as a duodenal ulcer.   The most common symptoms of a duodenal ulcer are waking at night with upper abdominal pain or upper abdominal pain that improves with eating.   With a gastric ulcer the pain may worsen with eating.   The pain is often described as a burning or dull ache. 

Courtly love<====>63792<====>Courtly loveCourtly love (or fin'amor in Occitan) was a medieval European literary conception of love that emphasized nobility and chivalry.  Medieval literature is filled with examples of knights setting out on adventures and performing various services for ladies because of their "courtly love".  This kind of love is originally a literary fiction created for the entertainment of the nobility, but as time passed, these ideas about love changed and attracted a larger audience.  In the high Middle Ages, a "game of love" developed around these ideas as a set of social practices.  "Loving nobly" was considered to be an enriching and improving practice. 

Meteoroid<====>63793<====>Meteoroid A meteoroid ( )  is a small rocky or metallic body in outer space. Meteoroids are significantly smaller than asteroids, and range in size from small grains to one-meter-wide objects.   Objects smaller than this are classified as micrometeoroids or space dust.  Most are fragments from comets or asteroids, whereas others are collision impact debris ejected from bodies such as the Moon or Mars.    When a meteoroid, comet, or asteroid enters Earth's atmosphere at a speed typically in excess of  , aerodynamic heating of that object produces a streak of light, both from the glowing object and the trail of glowing particles that it leaves in its wake. 

Impact event<====>63794<====>Impact eventAn impact event is a  collision between astronomical objects causing measurable effects.  Impact events have physical consequences and have been found to regularly occur in planetary systems, though the most frequent involve asteroids, comets or meteoroids and have minimal impact.  When large objects impact terrestrial planets like the Earth, there can be significant physical and biospheric consequences, though atmospheres mitigate many surface impacts through atmospheric entry.  Impact craters and structures are dominant landforms on many of the Solar System's solid objects and present the strongest empirical evidence for their frequency and scale. Impact events appear to have played a significant role in the evolution of the Solar System since its formation. 

Immunoperoxidase<====>63799<====>ImmunoperoxidaseImmunoperoxidase is a type of immunostain used in molecular biology, medical research, and clinical diagnostics.  In particular, immunoperoxidase reactions refer to a sub-class of immunohistochemical or immunocytochemical procedures in which the antibodies are visualized via a peroxidase-catalyzed reaction. Immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry are methods used to determine in which cells or parts of cells a particular protein or other macromolecule are located.   These stains use antibodies to bind to specific antigens, usually of protein or glycoprotein origin.  Since antibodies are normally invisible, special strategies must be employed to detect these bound antibodies.  In an immunoperoxidase procedure, an enzyme known as a peroxidase is used to catalyze a chemical reaction to produce a coloured product.

Shorten (file format)<====>63807<====>Shorten (file format)  Shorten (SHN) is a file format used for compressing audio data.  It is a form of data compression of files and is used to losslessly compress CD-quality audio files (44. 1 kHz 16-bit stereo PCM).  Shorten is no longer developed and other lossless audio codecs such as FLAC, Monkey's Audio (APE), TTA, and WavPack (WV) have become more popular.  However, Shorten is still in use by some people because there are legally traded concert recordings in circulation that are encoded as Shorten files.   Shorten files use the . shn file extension. 

Kitniyot<====>63811<====>KitniyotKitniyot  ( , qitniyyot) is a Hebrew word meaning legumes.   During the Passover holiday, the word kitniyot takes on a broader meaning to include, in addition to legumes, grains and seeds such as rice, corn, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, soybeans, peas and lentils.    According to Orthodox Ashkenazi laws, Kitniyot may not be eaten during Passover by Jews.   Although Reform and Conservative Ashkenazi Judaism currently allow for the consumption of Kitniyot during Passover, long-standing tradition in these and other communities is to abstain from their consumption.   According to Torat Eretz Yisrael and Minhagei Eretz Yisrael, any Jew worldwide, regardless of origin, and despite the practice of their forefathers, may eat kitniyot on Passover, for it is a practice rejected as an unnecessary precaution by Halachic authorities as early as the time of its emergence. 

Judenrat<====>63813<====>Judenrat  Judenrat (plural: Judenräte; German for "Jewish council") was a widely used administrative agency imposed by Nazi Germany during World War II, predominantly within the ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe, and the Jewish ghettos in German-occupied Poland.

Verilog<====>63863<====>Verilog Verilog, standardized as IEEE 1364, is a hardware description language (HDL) used to model electronic systems.  It is most commonly used in the design and verification of digital circuits at the register-transfer level of abstraction.  It is also used in the verification of analog circuits and mixed-signal circuits, as well as in the design of genetic circuits.  OverviewHardware description languages such as Verilog are similar to software programming languages because they include ways of describing the propagation time and signal strengths (sensitivity).  There are two types of assignment operators; a blocking assignment (=), and a non-blocking ( >>. 

DICOM<====>63864<====>DICOMDigital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) is a standard for storing and transmitting medical images enabling the integration of medical imaging devices  such as scanners, servers, workstations, printers, network hardware, and picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) from multiple manufacturers.  It has been widely adopted by hospitals, and is making inroads into  smaller applications like dentists' and doctors' offices. DICOM files can be exchanged between two entities that are capable of receiving image and patient data in DICOM format.  The different devices come with DICOM Conformance Statements which clearly state which DICOM classes they support, and the standard includes a file format definition and a network communications protocol that uses TCP/IP to communicate between systems. 

Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale<====>63866<====>Palermo Technical Impact Hazard ScaleThe Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale is a logarithmic scale used by astronomers to rate the potential hazard of impact of a near-earth object (NEO).  It combines two types of data—probability of impact and estimated kinetic yield—into a single "hazard" value.  A rating of 0 means the hazard is equivalent to the background hazard (defined as the average risk posed by objects of the same size or larger over the years until the date of the potential impact).   A rating of +2 would indicate the hazard is 100 times greater than a random background event.

History of the United States<====>63876<====>History of the United States The history of the United States began with the settlement of Indigenous people before 10,000 BC.  Numerous cultures formed.  The arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492 started the European colonization of the Americas.  Most colonies formed after 1600.   By the 1770s, thirteen British colonies contained 2. 5 million people along the Atlantic coast east of the Appalachian Mountains.  After defeating France, in the British government after 1765 imposed a series of new taxes, rejecting the colonists' argument that new taxes needed their approval (see Stamp Act 1765). 

Initial public offering<====>63879<====>Initial public offering  Initial public offering (IPO) or stock market launch is a type of public offering in which shares of a company are sold to institutional investors  and usually also retail (individual) investors; an IPO is underwritten by one or more investment banks, who also arrange for the shares to be listed on one or more stock exchange.  Through this process, colloquially known as floating, or going public, a privately held company is transformed into a public company.  Initial public offerings can be used: to raise new equity capital for the company concerned; to monetize the investments of private shareholders such as company founders or private equity investors; and to enable easy trading of existing holdings or future capital raising by becoming publicly traded enterprises.

Doric dialect (Scotland)<====>63890<====>Doric dialect (Scotland)  Doric, the popular name for Mid Northern Scots  or Northeast Scots,  refers to the Scots language as spoken in the northeast of Scotland.   There is an extensive body of literature, mostly poetry, ballads, and songs. NomenclatureThe term "Doric" was formerly used to refer to all dialects of Lowland Scots, but during the twentieth century it became increasingly associated with Mid Northern Scots.  The name possibly originated as a jocular reference to the Doric dialect of the Ancient Greek language.  Greek Dorians lived in Laconia, including Sparta, and other more rural areas, and were alleged by the ancient Greeks to have spoken laconically and in a language thought harsher in tone and more phonetically conservative than the Attic spoken in Athens. 

Scots language<====>63892<====>Scots language Scots is the Germanic language variety spoken in Lowland Scotland and parts of Ulster (where the local dialect is known as Ulster Scots).   It is sometimes called Lowland Scots to distinguish it from Scottish Gaelic, the Celtic language which was historically restricted to most of the Highlands, the Hebrides and Galloway after the 16th century.   The Scots language developed during the Middle English period as a distinct entity.    As there are no universally accepted criteria for distinguishing a language from a dialect, scholars and other interested parties often disagree about the linguistic, historical and social status of Scots and particularly its relationship to English. 

Maltese cat<====>63893<====>Maltese catA Maltese cat is any cat whose fur is either completely, or primarily, gray or blue and is of indeterminate breed.  DescriptionMany cats with such colouration are supposedly present on the island of Malta , which may have given rise to the use of the adjective in this context. There are several cat breeds that always produce blue or gray fur, of whom the adjective may be used.  These are the Russian Blue, the Chartreux and the Korat, none of which are associated with Malta.  There are several other breeds that often produce blues such as the British Shorthair.

Match<====>63904<====>Match  A match is a tool for starting a fire.  Typically,   modern matches are made of small wooden sticks or stiff paper.  One end is coated with a material that can be ignited by frictional heat generated by striking the match against a suitable surface.Wooden matches are packaged in matchboxes, and paper matches are partially cut into rows and stapled into matchbooks.  The coated end of a match, known as the match "head", consists of a bead of active ingredients and  binder; often coloured for easier inspection.  There are two main types of matches: safety matches, which can be struck only against a specially prepared surface, and strike-anywhere matches, for which any suitably frictional surface can be used.

Static random-access memory<====>63915<====>Static random-access memory   Static random-access memory (static RAM or SRAM)  is a type of semiconductor memory that uses bistable latching circuitry (flip-flop) to store each bit.   SRAM exhibits data remanence,    but it is still volatile in the conventional sense that data is eventually lost when the memory is not powered. The term static differentiates SRAM from DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) which must be periodically refreshed.   SRAM is faster and more expensive than DRAM; it is typically used for CPU cache while DRAM is used for a computer's main memory. Applications and usesCharacteristicsAdvantages:Low power consumptionSimplicity a refresh circuit is not neededReliabilityDisadvantages:PriceCapacityClock rate and powerThe power consumption of SRAM varies widely depending on how frequently it is accessed; in some instances, it can use as much power as dynamic RAM, when used at high frequencies, and some ICs can consume many watts at full bandwidth. 

Bled<====>63919<====>Bled   Bled ( ;  , Leksikon občin kraljestev in dežel zastopanih v državnem zboru, vol.  6: Kranjsko.  1906.  Vienna: C.  Kr.  Dvorna in Državna Tiskarna, p.  146.   in older sources also Feldes ) is a town on Lake Bled in the Upper Carniolan region of northwestern Slovenia.  It is the administrative seat of the Municipality of Bled.  It is most notable as a popular tourist destination in the Upper Carniola region and in Slovenia as whole, attracting visitors from abroad too. NameThe town was first attested in written sources as Ueldes in 1004 (and as Veldes in 1011). 

Cartagena, Colombia<====>63927<====>Cartagena, Colombia   The city of Cartagena, known in the colonial era as Cartagena de Indias (   ), is a major port founded in 1533, located on the northern coast of Colombia in the Caribbean Coast Region.  It was strategically located between the Magdalena and Sinú rivers and became the main port for trade between Spain and its overseas empire, establishing its importance by the early 1540s.  During the colonial era it was a key port for the export of Peruvian silver to Spain and for the import of African slaves under the asiento system. 

Mahican<====>63928<====>Mahican    The Mahicans (  or Mohicans  ) are an Eastern Algonquian Native American tribe related to the abutting Delaware people, originally settled in the upper Hudson River Valley (around Albany, New York) and western New England centered on Pittsfield, Massachusetts and lower present-day Vermont.  After 1680, due to conflicts with the Mohawk during the Beaver Wars, many were driven southeastwards across the present-day Massachusetts western border and the Berkshires to Berkshire County around Stockbridge, Massachusetts.  Since the forcible relocation of Native American populations to reservations in the American west during the 1830s, most descendants of the Mahican are located in Shawano County, Wisconsin, where decades later they eventually formed the federally recognized Stockbridge-Munsee Community with registered members of the Leni Lenape people and have a   reservation. 

Session key<====>63941<====>Session key A  session key is a single-use symmetric key used for encrypting all messages in one communication session.  A closely related term is content encryption key (CEK), traffic encryption key (TEK), or multicast key which refers to any key used to encrypt messages, as opposed to other uses, like encrypting other keys (key encryption key (KEK) or key wrapping key). Session keys can introduce complication into a system.  However, they solve some real problems.  There are two primary reasons to use session keys:Several cryptanalytic attacks become easier as more material encrypted with a specific key is available. 

Biosafety level<====>63942<====>Biosafety levelA biosafety level is a set of biocontainment precautions required to isolate dangerous biological agents in an enclosed laboratory facility.  The levels of containment range from the lowest biosafety level 1 (BSL-1) to the highest at level 4 (BSL-4).  In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have specified these levels.In the European Union, the same biosafety levels are defined in a directive.   In Canada the four levels are known as Containment Levels.   Facilities with these designations are also sometimes given as P1 through P4 (for Pathogen or Protection level), as in the term "P3 laboratory". 

Glorfindel<====>63943<====>Glorfindel Glorfindel ( ) is a fictional character in J. R. R.  Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium.  He is introduced in various material relating to the First Age of Middle-earth, including  The Silmarillion.  The name is also used for a character in The Lord of the Rings, which takes place in Middle-earth's Third Age.  In late writings, Tolkien works out how the two characters were one and the same, though this is not evident from the published versions of The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings.  The character and his name (meaning "blond, golden-haired") were among the first created, when Tolkien first conceived of what would become his Middle-earth legendarium in 1916–17. 

Key-agreement protocol<====>63944<====>Key-agreement protocol In cryptography, a key-agreement protocol is a protocol whereby two or more parties can agree on a key in such a way that both influence the outcome.  If properly done, this precludes undesired third parties from forcing a key choice on the agreeing parties.  Protocols that are useful in practice also do not reveal to any eavesdropping party what key has been agreed upon. Many key exchange systems have one party generate the key, and simply send that key to the other party -- the other party has no influence on the key. Using a key-agreement protocol avoids some of the key distribution problems associated with such systems. 

Falkner Island<====>63946<====>Falkner Island    Falkner Island (also called Faulkner's Island) is a   crescent-shaped island located in Long Island Sound 3 miles (5 km) off the coast of Guilford, Connecticut, United States.  The island has been visited by the Native Americans for thousands of years.  Its Quinnipiac name is "Massancummock", meaning "the place of the great fish hawks".  In 1641, Henry Whitfield and the founders of Guilford purchased the island from the Mohegan tribe's sachem, Uncas, as part of a transaction for the land east of East River.  Purchased by the Stone family in 1715, it remained in the family until it was sold to the government in 1801. 

United Nations Population Fund<====>63952<====>United Nations Population Fund   The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), formerly the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, is a UN organization.  The UNFPA says it "is the lead UN agency for delivering a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young person's potential is fulfilled".   Their work involves the improvement of reproductive health; including creation of national strategies and protocols, and providing supplies and services.  The organization has recently been known for its worldwide campaign against child marriage, obstetric fistula and female genital mutilation. The UNFPA supports programs in more than 150 countries and areas spread across four geographic regions: Arab States and Europe, Asia and the Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, and sub-Saharan Africa. 

Warchalking<====>63966<====>WarchalkingWarchalking is the drawing of symbols in public places to advertise an open Wi-Fi network. Inspired by hobo symbols, the warchalking marks were conceived by a group of friends in June 2002 and publicised by Matt Jones who designed the set of icons and produced a downloadable document containing them.    Within days of Jones publishing a blog entry about warchalking, articles appeared in dozens of publications and stories appeared on several major television news programs around the world. The word is formed by analogy to wardriving, the practice of driving around an area in a car to detect open Wi-Fi nodes. 

Double pendulum<====>63967<====>Double pendulum In physics and mathematics, in the area of dynamical systems, a double pendulum is a pendulum with another pendulum attached to its end, and is a simple physical system that exhibits rich dynamic behavior with a strong sensitivity to initial conditions.   The motion of a double pendulum is governed by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations and is chaotic. Analysis and interpretationSeveral variants of the double pendulum may be considered; the two limbs may be of equal or unequal lengths and masses, they may be simple pendulums or compound pendulums (also called complex pendulums) and the motion may be in three dimensions or restricted to the vertical plane.

Wi-Fi<====>63973<====>Wi-Fi    Wi-Fi or WiFi ( ) is a technology for wireless local area networking with devices based on the IEEE 802. 11 standards.  Wi-Fi is a trademark of the Wi-Fi Alliance, which restricts the use of the term Wi-Fi Certified to products that successfully complete interoperability certification testing.  Devices that can use Wi-Fi technology include personal computers, video-game consoles, phones and tablets, digital cameras, smart TVs, digital audio players and modern printers.  Wi-Fi compatible devices can connect to the Internet via a WLAN and a wireless access point.  Such an access point (or hotspot) has a range of about   indoors and a greater range outdoors. 

Fresnel lens<====>63978<====>Fresnel lensA Fresnel lens (    or    ) is a type of compact lens originally developed by French physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel for lighthouses.  The design allows the construction of lenses of large aperture and short focal length without the mass and volume of material that would be required by a lens of conventional design.   A Fresnel lens can be made much thinner than a comparable conventional lens, in some cases taking the form of a flat sheet.  A Fresnel lens can capture more oblique light from a light source, thus allowing the light from a lighthouse equipped with one to be visible over greater distances. 

Overtone singing<====>63981<====>Overtone singingOvertone singing – also known as overtone chanting,  harmonic singing or throat singing – is a type of singing in which the singer manipulates the resonances (or formants) created as air travels from the lungs, past the vocal folds, and out of the lips to produce a melody. The harmonics (fundamental and overtones) of a sound wave made by the human voice can be selectively amplified by changing the shape of the resonant cavities of the mouth, larynx and pharynx.   This resonant tuning allows singers to create apparently more than one pitch at the same time (the fundamental and a selected overtone), while actually generating only a single fundamental frequency with their vocal folds.

Balrog<====>64042<====>Balrog  Balrogs   are fictional creatures who appear in J.  R.  R.  Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium.  Such creatures first appeared in print in his novel The Lord of the Rings, where the Fellowship of the Ring encounter one known as Durin's Bane in the Mines of Moria.  Balrogs figured in Tolkien's earlier writings that appeared posthumously in The Silmarillion and other books. Balrogs are described as tall and menacing beings that can shroud themselves in fire, darkness, and shadow.  They frequently appeared armed with fiery whips "of many thongs",  and occasionally used long swords. 

Durin<====>64043<====>Durin Durin is the name of seven Kings of Dwarves in J.  R.  R.  Tolkien's legendarium.  They were held by the Dwarves to be the reincarnations of the first one, Durin the Deathless, resembling him in appearance and said to have preserved memories of their 'earlier lives'.  Tolkien took the name Durin, like most of the dwarf names in his works, from Norse mythology.  This he later explained by the translation fiction: since Tolkien's invented language of Westron was translated with English, the language of Dale, used by Dwarves for their "outer" names, was translated with Old Norse. 

Michael Heseltine<====>64044<====>Michael Heseltine  Michael Ray Dibdin Heseltine, Baron Heseltine,   (born 21 March 1933) is a British Conservative politician and businessman.  Having begun his career as a property developer, he became one of the founders of the publishing house Haymarket.  Heseltine served as a Member of Parliament from 1966 to 2001, and was a prominent figure in the governments of Margaret Thatcher and John Major, including serving as Deputy Prime Minister under the latter. Heseltine entered the Cabinet in 1979 as Secretary of State for the Environment, where he promoted the "Right to Buy" campaign that allowed two million families to purchase their council houses. 

Chromosomal crossover<====>64045<====>Chromosomal crossoverChromosomal crossover (or crossing over) is the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes that results in recombinant chromosomes during sexual reproduction.  It is one of the final phases of genetic recombination, which occurs in the pachytene stage of prophase I of meiosis during a process called synapsis.  Synapsis begins before the synaptonemal complex develops and is not completed until near the end of prophase I.  Crossover usually occurs when matching regions on matching chromosomes break and then reconnect to the other chromosome. Crossing over was described, in theory, by Thomas Hunt Morgan.  He relied on the discovery of Frans Alfons Janssens who described the phenomenon in 1909 and had called it "chiasmatypie". 

Misty Mountains<====>64050<====>Misty Mountains  In J.  R.  R.  Tolkien's fantasy world of Middle-earth, the Misty Mountains are an epic mountain range, and one of the most important features of Middle-earth's geography.   The mountain-chain is less well known by its  alternative names.  One of these is Hithaeglir (meaning mist-peak-line in Sindarin, one of the languages invented by Tolkien);  this was misspelled as Hithaiglin on the original Lord of the Rings map.  Other alternative names are the Mountains of Mist or the Towers of Mist.   The range stretched continuously for some 900 miles  (1440 kilometres) across the continent of Middle-earth.

National Register of Historic Places<====>64065<====>National Register of Historic Places    The National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) is the United States federal government's official list of districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects deemed worthy of preservation for their historical significance.  A property listed in the National Register, or located within a National Register Historic District, may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred preserving the property. The passage of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) in 1966 established the National Register and the process for adding properties to it.  Of the more than one million properties on the National Register, 80,000 are listed individually.

Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip Life in Hell but instead decided to create a new set of characters. 

New World Syndrome<====>64073<====>New World SyndromeNew World Syndrome is a set of non-communicable diseases brought on by consumption of junk food and a sedentary lifestyle, especially common to the indigenous peoples of the "New World" (i. e.  of the Americas).  Indigenous peoples of Oceania and Circumpolar peoples, and perhaps other populations of Asiatic origin are similarly affected and perhaps genetically predisposed.It is characterized by obesity, heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and shortened life span. CausesNew World Syndrome is linked to a change from a traditional diet and exercise to a Western diet and a sedentary lifestyle.  The traditional occupations of indigenous people—such as fishing, farming, and hunting—tended to involve constant activity, whereas modern office jobs do not. 

Mergenthaler Linotype Company<====>64081<====>Mergenthaler Linotype Company The Mergenthaler Linotype Company is a corporation founded in the United States in 1886 to market the Linotype machine ( ), a system to cast metal type in lines (linecaster) invented by Ottmar Mergenthaler.  It became the world's leading manufacturer of book and newspaper typesetting equipment; outside North America, its only serious challenger for book production was the Anglo-American Monotype Corporation.  It also offered phototypesetting and digital products before being taken over by Monotype Imaging in 2006. Founding The invention of a machine to replace the labor-intensive task of setting type by hand was one that many inventors had tackled during the 19th Century. 

Junk food<====>64083<====>Junk foodJunk food is a pejorative term for food containing high levels of calories from sugar or fat with little fibre, protein, vitamins or minerals.  Junk food can also refer to high protein food like meat prepared with saturated fat.  Food from many hamburger outlets, pizza and fried chicken outlets is often considered as junk food.   Concerns about the negative health effects resulting from a "junk food"-heavy diet, especially obesity, have resulted in public health awareness campaigns, and restrictions on advertising and sale in several countries.    . Origin of the termThe term junk food dates back at least to the early 1950s,  although it has been reported that it was coined in 1972 by Michael F. 

Caramel<====>64085<====>Caramel   Caramel (  or    ) is a medium- to dark-orange confectionery product made by heating a variety of sugars.  It can be used as a flavoring in puddings and desserts, as a filling in bonbons, or as a topping for ice cream and custard. The process of caramelization consists of heating sugar slowly to around  .  As the sugar heats, the molecules break down and re-form into compounds with a characteristic color and flavor. A variety of candies, desserts, and confections are made with caramel: brittles, nougats, pralines, crème brûlée, crème caramel, and caramel apples. 

Type design<====>64087<====>Type design Type design may also refer to aircraft type design. Type design is the art and process of designing typefaces.  It is often used synonymously with the term "font design"; technically, font design is the rendering of a typeface design into an entire available family of keyboardable characters, while typeface design is the shaping of individual glyphs, albeit with an eye to the eventual incorporation as a font.  For the purposes of this article, the term typeface design will include the design of fonts. A typeface differs from other modes of graphic production such as handwriting and drawing in that it is the mechanical storage and dispensation of alphanumeric characters. 

Corn syrup<====>64088<====>Corn syrupCorn syrup is a food syrup which is made from the starch of corn (called maize in some countries) and contains varying amounts of maltose and higher oligosaccharides, depending on the grade.  Corn syrup, also known as glucose syrup to confectioners, is used in foods to soften texture, add volume, prevent crystallization of sugar, and enhance flavor.  Corn syrup is distinct from high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which is manufactured from corn syrup by converting a large proportion of its glucose into fructose using the enzyme D-xylose isomerase, thus producing a sweeter compound due to higher levels of fructose. 

Verdana<====>64093<====>Verdana  Verdana is a humanist sans-serif typeface designed by Matthew Carter for Microsoft Corporation, with hand-hinting done by Thomas Rickner, then at Monotype.  Demand for such a typeface was recognized by Virginia Howlett of Microsoft's typography group and commissioned by Steve Ballmer. The name "Verdana" is based on verdant (something green), and Ana (the name of Howlett's eldest daughter).  Bearing similarities to humanist sans-serif typefaces such as Frutiger, Verdana was designed to be readable at small sizes on the low-resolution computer screens of the period.   Like many designs of this type, Verdana has a large x-height (tall lower-case characters), with wider proportions and loose letter-spacing than on print-orientated designs like Helvetica. 

Sans-serif<====>64097<====>Sans-serif Sans-serif font  Serif font  Serif font (serifs in red)  In typography and lettering, a sans-serif, sans serif, gothic, or simply sans letterform is one that does not have extending features called "serifs" at the end of strokes.   Sans-serif fonts tend to have less line width variation than serif fonts.  In most print, they are often used for headings rather than for body text.   They are often used to convey simplicity and modernity or minimalism. Sans-serif fonts have become the most prevalent for display of text on computer screens.  On lower-resolution digital displays, fine details like serifs may disappear or appear too large. 

Serif<====>64100<====>Serif  Sans-serif font  Serif font  Serif font (red serifs) In typography, a serif ( ) is a small line attached to the end of a stroke in a letter or symbol.   A typeface with serifs is called a serif typeface (or serifed typeface).  A typeface without serifs is called sans-serif or sans serif, from the French sans, meaning "without".  Some typography sources refer to sans-serif typefaces as "Grotesque" (in German "grotesk") or "Gothic",   and serif typefaces as "Roman". Origins and etymologySerifs originated in the Latin alphabet with inscriptional lettering—words carved into stone in Roman antiquity. 

Typeface<====>64105<====>Typeface  In typography, a typeface (also known as font family) is a set of one or more fonts each composed of glyphs that share common design features.  Each font of a typeface has a specific weight, style, condensation, width, slant, italicization, ornamentation, and designer or foundry (and formerly size, in metal fonts).  For example, "ITC Garamond Bold Condensed Italic" means the bold, condensed-width, italic version of ITC Garamond.  It is a different font from "ITC Garamond Condensed Italic" and "ITC Garamond Bold Condensed," but all are fonts within the same typeface, "ITC Garamond. " ITC Garamond is a different typeface from "Adobe Garamond" or "Monotype Garamond.

Ice skate<====>64120<====>Ice skateIce skates are boots with blades attached to the bottom, used to propel the bearer across a sheet of ice while ice skating. The first ice skates were made from leg bones of horse, ox or deer, and were attached to feet with leather straps.  These skates required a pole with a sharp metal spike that was used for pushing the skater forward, unlike modern bladed skates.  Modern skates come in many different varieties, which are chosen depending on the nature of the requirements needed for the skating activity.  They are worn recreationally in ice rinks or on frozen bodies of water across the globe and are used as footwear in many sports, including figure skating, ice hockey, bandy, speed skating and tour skating. 

Catacombs of Paris<====>64129<====>Catacombs of Paris  The Catacombs of Paris ( French:  Catacombes de Paris,  )  are underground ossuaries in Paris, France, which hold the remains of more than six million people  in a small part of a tunnel network built to consolidate Paris' ancient stone mines.  Extending south from the Barrière d’Enfer ("Gate of Hell") former city gate, this ossuary was created as part of the effort to eliminate the city's overflowing cemeteries.  Preparation work began not long after a 1774 series of gruesome Saint Innocents-cemetery-quarter basement wall collapses added a sense of urgency to the cemetery-eliminating measure, and from 1786, nightly processions of covered wagons transferred remains from most of Paris' cemeteries to a mine shaft opened near the Rue de la Tombe-Issoire.

Sphynx cat<====>64150<====>Sphynx cat {{Infobox cat breed  }}The Sphynx cat is a breed of cat known for its lack of coat (fur).  It was developed through selective breeding, starting in the 1960s.  The skin should have the texture of chamois, as it has fine hairs.  Whiskers may be present, either whole or broken, or may be totally absent.  Their skin is the color that their fur would be, and all the usual cat markings (solid, point, van, tabby, tortie, etc. ) may be found on the Sphynx cat's skin.  Because they have no coat, they lose more body heat than coated cats. 

Franciscans<====>64176<====>Franciscans  The Franciscans are a group of related mendicant religious orders within the Catholic Church, founded in 1209 by Francis of Assisi.   These orders include the Order of Friars Minor, the Order of Saint Clare, and the Third Order of Saint Francis.

Bloodletting<====>64196<====>Bloodletting Bloodletting (or blood-letting) is the withdrawal of blood from a patient to prevent or cure illness and disease.  Bloodletting was based on an ancient system of medicine in which blood and other bodily fluids were regarded as "humours" that had to remain in proper balance to maintain health.  It is claimed to have been the most common medical practice performed by surgeons from antiquity until the late 19th century, a span of almost 2,000 years.In Europe the practice continued to be relatively common until the end of the 18th century.

Kinetic theory of gases<====>64204<====>Kinetic theory of gasesThe kinetic theory describes a gas as a large number of submicroscopic particles (atoms or molecules), all of which are in constant rapid motion that has randomness arising from their many collisions with each other and with the walls of the container. Kinetic theory explains macroscopic properties of gases, such as pressure, temperature, viscosity, thermal conductivity, and volume, by considering their molecular composition and motion.  The theory posits that gas pressure is due to the impacts, on the walls of a container, of molecules or atoms moving at different velocities. Kinetic theory defines temperature in its own way, in contrast with the thermodynamic definition. 

Tagus<====>64205<====>Tagus    The Tagus ( ;  ,  ;  ,   ) is the longest river in the Iberian Peninsula.

Bernoulli's principle<====>64219<====>Bernoulli's principle  In fluid dynamics, Bernoulli's principle states that an increase in the speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in the fluid's potential energy.   Batchelor, G. K.  (1967), Section 3. 5, pp.  156–64.   The principle is named after Daniel Bernoulli who published it in his book Hydrodynamica in 1738.  Bernoulli's principle can be applied to various types of fluid flow, resulting in various forms of Bernoulli's equation; there are different forms of Bernoulli's equation for different types of flow.  The simple form of Bernoulli's equation is valid for incompressible flows (e. 

Biorhythm<====>64221<====>Biorhythm  A biorhythm (from Greek βίος - bios, "life"  and ῥυθμός - rhuthmos, "any regular recurring motion, rhythm" ) is an attempt to predict various aspects of a person's life through simple mathematical cycles.  The theory was developed by Wilhelm Fliess in the late 19th century, and was popularized in the United States in late 1970s.  Most scientists believe that the idea has no more predictive power than chance.    "No evidence exists to support the concept of biorhythms; in fact, scientific data refute their existence. "  "The theory of biorhythms is a theory that claims our daily lives are significantly affected by rhythmic cycles. 

Milo of Croton<====>64222<====>Milo of CrotonMilo of Croton ( ; Greek: Μίλων, Mílōn; gen. : Μίλωνος, Mílōnos) was a 6th-century BC wrestler from the Magna Graecian city of Croton, who enjoyed a brilliant wrestling career and won many victories in the most important athletic festivals of ancient Greece.

Milo was also said to have carried a bull on his shoulders, and to have burst a band about his brow by simply inflating the veins of his temples. 

Powerlifting<====>64223<====>Powerlifting Powerlifting is a strength sport that consists of three attempts at maximal weight on three lifts: squat, bench press, and deadlift.  As in the sport of Olympic weightlifting, it involves the athlete attempting a maximal weight single lift of a barbell loaded with weight plates.   Powerlifting evolved from a sport known as "odd lifts", which followed the same three-attempt format but used a wider variety of events, akin to strongman competition.  Eventually odd lifts became standardized to the current three. In competition, lifts may be performed equipped or un-equipped (typically referred to as 'raw' lifting or 'classic' in the IPF specifically).

Reed's law<====>64333<====>Reed's lawReed's law is the assertion of David P.  Reed that the utility of large  , particularly social networks, can scale exponentially with the size of the network  . The reason for this is that the number of possible sub-groups of network participants is 2 N  − N − 1, where N is the number of participants.   This grows much more rapidly than either the number of participants, N, orthe number of possible pair connections, N(N − 1)/2 (which follows Metcalfe's law). so that even if the utility of groups available to be joined is very small on a per-group basis, eventually the network effect of potential group membership can dominate the overall economics of the system. 

Moiré pattern<====>64343<====>Moiré pattern  In mathematics, physics, and art, a moiré pattern ( ;  ) or moiré fringes    are large-scale interference patterns that can be produced when an opaque ruled pattern with transparent gaps is overlaid on another similar pattern.

Moiré patterns appear in many different situations.  In printing, the printed pattern of dots can negatively interfere with the image.  In television and digital photography, a pattern on an object being photographed can interfere with the shape of the light sensors to generate unwanted artifacts.

Pieter Bruegel the Elder<====>64384<====>Pieter Bruegel the Elder  Pieter Bruegel (also Brueghel) the Elder ( ; c.  1525-1530 – 9 September 1569) was the most significant artist of Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting,  a painter and printmaker from Brabant, known for his landscapes and peasant scenes (so called genre painting); he was a pioneer in making both types of subject the focus in large paintings. He was a formative influence on Dutch Golden Age painting and later painting in general in his innovative choices of subject matter, as one of the first generation of artists to grow up when religious subjects had ceased to be the natural subject matter of painting. 

Jan Brueghel the Elder<====>64386<====>Jan Brueghel the ElderJan Brueghel the Elder ( ; also Breughel;  ; 1568 – 13 January 1625) was a Flemish painter and draughtsman.

Along with his brother Ambrosius, he produced landscapes, allegorical scenes and other works of meticulous detail.   Brueghel also copied works by his father and sold them with his father's signature.   His work is distinguishable from that of his parent by being less well executed and lighter. 

Video game crash of 1983<====>64393<====>Video game crash of 1983   The video game crash of 1983   (known as the Atari shock in Japan) was a large-scale recession in the video game industry that occurred from 1983 to 1985, primarily in North America, because of market saturation.  Revenues peaked at around $3. 2 billion in 1983, then fell to around $100 million by 1985 (a drop of almost 97 percent).  The crash was a serious event that brought an abrupt end to what is retrospectively considered the second generation of console video gaming in North America. The crash decimated the then-booming industry, and led to the bankruptcy of several companies producing home computers and video game consoles in the region.

San Andreas Fault<====>64460<====>San Andreas Fault  The San Andreas Fault is a continental transform fault that extends roughly   through California.   It forms the tectonic boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, and its motion is right-lateral strike-slip (horizontal).  The fault divides into three segments, each with different characteristics and a different degree of earthquake risk.  The slip rate along the fault ranges from  /yr.    The fault was identified in 1895 by Professor Andrew Lawson of UC Berkeley, who discovered the northern zone.  It is often described as having been named after San Andreas Lake, a small body of water that was formed in a valley between the two plates.

First considered part of Naturalism, he became associated with the decadent movement with his publication of À rebours. 

Concatenation<====>64474<====>Concatenation    In formal language theory and computer programming, string concatenation  is the operation of joining character strings  .   For example, the concatenation of "snow" and "ball" is "snowball".  In some but not all formalisations of concatenation theory, also called string theory, string concatenation is a primitive notion. SyntaxIn many programming languages, string concatenation is a binary infix operator.   The  +  (plus) operator is often overloaded to denote concatenation for string arguments:  "Hello, " + "World"  has the value  "Hello, World" .  In other languages there is a separate operator, particularly to specify implicit type conversion to string, as opposed to more complicated behavior for generic plus.

Purchasing power parity<====>64489<====>Purchasing power parityPurchasing power parity (PPP) is an economic theory that states that the exchange rate between two currencies is equal to the ratio of the currencies' respective purchasing power.  Theories that invoke purchasing power parity assume that in some circumstances (for example, as a long-run tendency) it would cost exactly the same number of, for example, US dollars to buy euros and then to use the difference in value to buy a market basket of goods as it would cost to directly purchase the market basket of goods with dollars.  A fall in either currency's purchasing power would lead to a proportional decrease in that currency's valuation on the foreign exchange market. 

Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov<====>64491<====>Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov  Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov ( ; born November 10, 1935) is a Russian (and former Soviet) theoretical astrophysicist and cosmologist.

Tamale<====>64495<====>Tamale   A tamale ( ,  )  is a traditional Mexican dish made of masa or dough (starchy, and usually corn-based), which is steamed in a corn husk or banana leaf.  The wrapping is discarded before eating.  Tamales can be filled with meats, cheeses, fruits, vegetables, chilies or any preparation according to taste, and both the filling and the cooking liquid may be seasoned. OriginTamales originated in Mesoamerica as early as 8000 to 5000 BC.    As making tamales is a simple method of cooking corn, it may have been brought from Mexico to Central and South America. 

Arrondissement<====>64501<====>Arrondissement An arrondissement ( ;  ) is any of various administrative divisions of France, Belgium, Haiti, certain other Francophone countries, and the Netherlands. EuropeFrance The 101 French departments are divided into 342 arrondissements, which may be roughly translated into English as districts.   The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture.  When an arrondissement contains the prefecture (capital) of the department, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture.   Arrondissements are further divided into cantons and communes. Municipal arrondissement A municipal arrondissement ( , pronounced  ), is a subdivision of the commune, used in the three largest cities: Paris, Lyon, and Marseille.

Fast Ethernet<====>64506<====>Fast EthernetIn computer networking, Fast Ethernet is a collective term for a number of Ethernet standards that carry traffic at the nominal rate of 100 Mbit/s (the earlier Ethernet speed was 10 Mbit/s).  Of the Fast Ethernet standards, 100BASE-TX is by far the most common. Fast Ethernet was introduced in 1995 as the IEEE 802. 3u standard  and remained the fastest version of Ethernet for three years before the introduction of Gigabit Ethernet.   The acronym GE/FE is sometimes used for devices supporting both standards.  NomenclatureThe "100" in the media type designation refers to the transmission speed of 100 Mbit/s, while the "BASE" refers to baseband signalling. 

2<====>64516<====>2  2 (Two;  ) is a number, numeral, and glyph.  It is the natural number following 1 and preceding 3. In mathematicsAn integer is called even if it is divisible by 2.  For integers written in a numeral system based on an even number, such as decimal,hexadecimal, or in any other base that is even, divisibility by 2 is easily tested by merely looking at the last digit.  If it is even, then the whole number is even.  In particular, when written in the decimal system, all multiples of 2 will end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. 

Basic Rate Interface<====>64519<====>Basic Rate Interface Basic Rate Interface (BRI, 2B+D, 2B1D) or Basic Rate Access is an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) configuration intended primarily for use in subscriber lines similar to those that have long been used for voice-grade telephone service. As such, an ISDN BRI connection can use the existing telephone infrastructure at a business. The BRI configuration provides 2 data (bearer) channels (B channels) at 64 kbit/s each and 1 control (delta) channel (D channel) at 16 kbit/s.  The B channels are used for voice or user data, and the D channel is used for any combination of data, control/signaling, and X. 

Catacombs<====>64523<====>Catacombs  Catacombs are human-made subterranean passageways for religious practice.  Any chamber used as a burial place is a catacomb, although the word is most commonly associated with the Roman Empire.  Etymology and HistoryThe first place to be referred to as catacombs was the system of underground tombs between the 2nd and 3rd milestones of the Appian Way in Rome, where the bodies of the apostles Peter and Paul, among others, were said to have been buried.  The name of that place in late Latin was catacombae, a word of obscure origin, possibly deriving from a proper name, or else a corruption of the Latin phrase cata tumbas, "among the tombs". 

2B1Q<====>64524<====>2B1QTwo-binary, one-quaternary (2B1Q) is a line code used in the U interface of the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) Basic Rate Interface (BRI) and the high-bit-rate digital subscriber line (HDSL).   2B1Q is a four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) scheme without redundancy, mapping two bits (2B) into one quaternary symbol (1Q).  A competing encoding technique in the ISDN basic rate U interface, mainly used in Europe, is 4B3T. To minimize error propagation, bit pairs (dibits) are assigned to voltage levels according to a Gray code, as follows:Dibit  Signal level 10  +450 mV 11  +150 mV 01  −150 mV 00  −450 mV If the voltage is misread as an adjacent level, this causes only a 1-bit error in the decoded data.

Gigabit Ethernet<====>64636<====>Gigabit Ethernet   In computer networking, Gigabit Ethernet (GbE or 1 GigE) is a term describing various technologies for transmitting Ethernet frames at a rate of a gigabit per second (1,000,000,000 bits per second), as defined by the IEEE 802. 3-2008 standard.  It came into use beginning in 1999, gradually supplanting Fast Ethernet in wired local networks, as a result of being considerably faster.  The cables and equipment are very similar to previous standards and have been very common and economical since 2010. Half-duplex gigabit links connected through repeater hubs were part of the IEEE specification,  but the specification is not updated anymore and full-duplex operation with switches is used exclusively.

The Tehran-Bandar-Abbas railroad, opened in 1995, connects Bandar-Abbas to the railroad system of Central Asia via Tehran and Mashhad. 

Foreign relations of Iran<====>64709<====>Foreign relations of Iran   Foreign relations of Iran refers to inter-governmental relationships between the Islamic Republic of Iran and other countries.  Geography is a very significant factor in informing Iran's foreign policy.   Following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the newly born Islamic Republic, under the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini, dramatically reversed the pro-American foreign policy of the last Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.  Since then the country's policies have oscillated between the two opposing tendencies of revolutionary ardour, which would eliminate Western and non-Muslim influences while promoting the Islamic revolution abroad, and pragmatism, which would advance economic development and normalization of relations. 

Modest Mussorgsky<====>64710<====>Modest Mussorgsky   Modest Petrovich Mussorgsky ( ;   –  ) was a Russian composer, one of the group known as "The Five".  He was an innovator of Russian music in the romantic period.  He strove to achieve a uniquely Russian musical identity, often in deliberate defiance of the established conventions of Western music. Many of  his works were inspired by Russian history, Russian folklore, and other nationalist themes.  Such works include the opera Boris Godunov, the orchestral tone poem Night on Bald Mountain and the piano suite Pictures at an Exhibition. For many years Mussorgsky's works were mainly known in versions revised or completed by other composers.

Noricum<====>64716<====>Noricum    Noricum is the Latin name for a Celtic kingdom, or federation of tribes,  that included most of modern Austria and part of Slovenia.  In the first century AD, it became a province of the Roman Empire.  Its borders were the Danube to the north, Raetia and Vindelicia to the west, Pannonia to the east and southeast, and Italia (Venetia et Histria) to the south.  The kingdom was founded around 400 BC, and had its capital at the royal residence at Virunum on the Magdalensberg.   Area and populationIts area corresponded to the greater part of modern Styria and Carinthia, Upper/Lower Austria west of Vienna, Salzburg, a part of Bavaria, and a part of Slovenia.

Paul Gauguin<====>64719<====>Paul Gauguin  Eugène Henri Paul Gauguin ( ;  ; 7 June 1848 – 8 May 1903) was a French post-Impressionist artist.  Unappreciated until after his death, Gauguin is now recognized for his experimental use of color and Synthetist style that were distinctly different from Impressionism.  Towards the end of his life he spent ten years in French Polynesia, and most of his paintings from this time depict people or landscapes from that region. His work was influential to the French avant-garde and many modern artists, such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse.  Gauguin's art became popular after his death, partially from the efforts of art dealer Ambroise Vollard, who organized exhibitions of his work late in his career and assisted in organizing two important posthumous exhibitions in Paris.

Ceiba<====>64723<====>Ceiba   Ceiba is a genus of trees in the Malvaceace family, native to tropical and subtropical areas of the Americas (from Mexico and the Caribbean to N Argentina) and tropical West Africa.   Some species can grow to   tall or more, with a straight, largely branchless trunk that culminates in a huge, spreading canopy, and buttress roots that can be taller than a grown person.  The best-known, and most widely cultivated, species is Kapok, Ceiba pentandra,  one of several trees called kapok. Ceiba species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species, including the leaf-miner Bucculatrix ceibae, which feeds exclusively on the genus.

World file<====>64726<====>World fileA world file is a six line plain text sidecar file used by geographic information systems (GIS) to georeference raster map images. The file specification was introduced by Esri,and consists of six coefficients of an affine transformation that describes the location, scale and rotation of a raster on a map.DefinitionThe generic meaning of the six parameters in a world file (as defined by Esri ) are:Line 1: A: pixel size in the x-direction in map units/pixelLine 2: D: rotation about y-axisLine 3: B: rotation about x-axisLine 4: E: pixel size in the y-direction in map units, almost always negative Line 5: C: x-coordinate of the center of the upper left pixelLine 6: F: y-coordinate of the center of the upper left pixelThis description is however misleading in that the D and B parameters are not angular rotations, and that the A and E parameters do not correspond to the pixel size if D or B are not zero. The A, D, B and E  parameters are sometimes named "x-scale", "y-skew", "x-skew" and "y-scale".A better description of the A, D, B and E parameters are:Line 1: A: x-component of the pixel width (x-scale)Line 2: D: y-component of the pixel width (y-skew)Line 3: B: x-component of the pixel height (x-skew)Line 4: E: y-component of the pixel height (y-scale), typically negativeAll four parameters are expressed in the map units, which are described by the spatial reference system for the raster.When D or B are non-zero the pixel width is given by: \sqrt{A^2+D^2} and the pixel height by \sqrt{B^2+E^2} World files describing a map on the Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system (UTM) use these conventions:D and B are usually 0, since the image pixels are usually made to align with the UTM gridC is the UTM eastingF is the UTM northingUnits are always meters per pixelThe above description applies also to a rectangular, non-rotated image which might be, for example, overlaid on an orthogonally projected map. If the world file describes an image that is rotated from the axis of the target projection, however, then A, D, B and E must be derived from the required affine transformation (see below). Specifically, A and E will no longer be the meter/pixel measurement on their respective axes.These values are used in a six-parameter affine transformation: \begin{bmatrix} x\prime \\y\prime \end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix} A & B & C\\D & E & F\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} x \\y \\1 \end{bmatrix} which can be written as this set of equations: \begin{align}x' &= A\,x + B\,y + C \\y' &= D\,x + E\,y + F\end{align} where:x is the calculated UTM easting of the pixel on the mapy is the calculated UTM northing of the pixel on the mapx is the column number of the pixel in the image counting from lefty is the row number of the pixel in the image counting from topA or x-scale; dimension of a pixel in map units in x-directionB, D are rotation termsC, F are translation terms: x, y map coordinates of the center of the upper-left pixelE is negative of y-scale: dimension of a pixel in map units in y-directionThe y-scale (E) is negative because the origins of an image and the UTM coordinate system are different. The origin of an image is located in the upper-left corner, whereas the origin of the map coordinate system is located in the lower-left corner. Row values in the image increase from the origin downward, while y-coordinate values in the map increase from the origin upward. Many mapping programs are unable to handle "upside down" images (i.e. those with a positive y-scale).To go from UTM(x'y') to pixel position(x,y) one can use the equation: \begin{align}x&=\frac{Ex'-By'+BF-EC}{AE-DB}\\y&=\frac{-Dx'+Ay'+DC-AF}{AE-DB}\end{align} Example:Original  falknermap.jpg  is 800×600 pixels (map not shown).Its world file is  falknermap.jgw  and contains:32.00.00.0-32.0691200.04576000.0 The position of Falkner Island light on the map image is:x = 171 pixels from lefty = 343 pixels from topThis gives:x1 = 696672 meters Eastingy1 = 4565024 meters NorthingThe UTM (grid) zone is not given so the coordinates are ambiguous — they can represent a position in any of the approximately 120 UTM grid zones. In this case, approximate latitude and longitude (41.2, −072.7) were looked up in a gazetteer and the UTM (grid) zone was found to be 18 using a Web-based converter.Filename extensionThe filename extension of the world file is based on the raster file's extension.One convention is to append the letter "w" to the end of the raster filename:falknermap.jpg → falknermap.jpgw.An alternative naming convention is also well supported.The second letter of the original filename extension is removed, and the letter "w"is added at the end. For example,falknermap.jpg → falknermap.jgw orfalknermap.tif → falknermap.tfw.This convention was developed for filenames that need to conform to the 8.3 file naming convention.LocalizationWhen writing world files it is advisable to ignore localization settings and always use "." as the decimal separator.  Also, negative numbers should be specified with the "-" character exclusively.  This ensures maximum portability of the images.See alsoEsri grid – embeds a similar georeferencing context within a single raster fileMapInfo TAB format - a popular geospatial vector data format for GIS softwareNotes and references External linksEsri World File FormatOnline Worldfile Calculator

Freising manuscripts<====>64729<====>Freising manuscripts  The Freising manuscripts (also Freising folia, Freising fragments, or Freising monuments;  ,  ,   or  ) are the first Latin-script continuous text in a Slavic language and "the oldest document in Slovene".  Description and originThe manuscripts were found bound into a Latin codex (manuscript book).  Four parchment leaves and a further quarter of a page have been preserved.  They consist of three texts in the oldest Slovene dialect.  Linguistic, stylistic and contextual analyses reveal that these are church texts of careful composition and literary form. The precise date of the origin of the Freising Manuscripts cannot be exactly determined; the original text was probably written in the 9th century.

Jacob Bernoulli<====>64740<====>Jacob Bernoulli  Jacob Bernoulli (also known as James or Jacques;   – 16 August 1705) was one of the many prominent mathematicians in the Bernoulli family.  He was an early proponent of Leibnizian calculus and had sided with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz during the Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy.  He is known for his numerous contributions to calculus, and along with his brother Johann, was one of the founders of the calculus of variations.  He also discovered the fundamental mathematical constant e.  However, his most important contribution was in the field of probability, where he derived the first version of the law of large numbers in his work Ars Conjectandi.

Haakon VII of Norway<====>64956<====>Haakon VII of Norway   Haakon VII ( ;  born Christian Frederik Carl Georg Valdemar Axel; 3 August 1872 21 September 1957), known as Prince Carl of Denmark until 1905, was a Danish prince who became the first king of Norway after the 1905 dissolution of the union with Sweden.  He reigned from November 1905 until his death in September 1957. As one of the few elected monarchs, Haakon quickly won the respect and affection of his people.   He played a pivotal role in uniting the Norwegian nation in its resistance to the German invasion and subsequent five-year-long occupation of his country during World War II. 

Noun phrase<====>64958<====>Noun phraseA noun phrase or nominal phrase (abbreviated NP) is a phrase which has a noun (or indefinite pronoun) as its head, or which performs the same grammatical function as such a phrase.   Noun phrases are very common cross-linguistically, and they may be the most frequently occurring phrase type. Noun phrases often function as verb subjects and objects, as predicative expressions, and as the complements of prepositions.  Noun phrases can be embedded inside each other; for instance, the noun phrase some of his constituents contains the shorter noun phrase his constituents. In some more modern theories of grammar, noun phrases with determiners are analyzed as having the determiner rather than the noun as their head; they are then referred to as determiner phrases. 

Poverty<====>64959<====>Poverty   Poverty is the scarcity or the lack of a certain (variant) amount of material possessions or money.  Poverty is a multifaceted concept, which may include social, economic, and political elements.  Absolute poverty, extreme poverty, or destitution refers to the complete lack of the means necessary to meet basic personal needs such as food, clothing and shelter.    The threshold at which absolute poverty is defined is considered to be about the same, independent of the person's permanent location or era.  On the other hand, relative poverty occurs when a person who lives in a given country does not enjoy a certain minimum level of "living standards" as compared to the rest of the population of that country. 

Titan (game)<====>64961<====>Titan (game) Titan is a fantasy board game for two to six players, designed by Jason B.  McAllister and David A.  Trampier.  It was first published in 1980 by Gorgonstar, a small company created by the designers.  Soon afterward, the rights were licensed to Avalon Hill, which made several minor revisions and published the game for many years.  Titan went out of print in 1998, when Avalon Hill was sold and ceased operations.  A new edition of Titan, with artwork by Kurt Miller and Mike Doyle and produced by Canadian publisher Valley Games became available in late 2008.

Her musical and dramatic talents led to her being hailed as La Divina. 

Cabbage Patch Kids<====>64968<====>Cabbage Patch Kids Cabbage Patch Kids are a line of soft sculptured dolls sold by Xavier Roberts and registered in the United States copyright office in 1978.   The doll brand was one of the most popular toy fads of the 1980s and one of the longest-running doll franchises in the United States.   The characters appeared in many other Cabbage Patch merchandising products ranging from animated cartoons to record albums to board games. Production historyCreation and developmentAccording to Roberts, as a 21-year-old art student, he utilized the quilting skills he learned from his mother and the historic technique of "needle molding" to develop his own line of fabric sculptures. 

337 BC<====>64969<====>337 BC    Year 337 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.  At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Longus and Paetus (or, less frequently, year 417 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 337 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. Events By placeGreeceAt a Pan-Hellenic Conference in Corinth, Philip II of Macedon announces the formation of the League of Corinth to liberate the Greek cities of Asia Minor from Persian rule, ostensibly because the Persian King, Arses, refuses to make reparations to Philip for Artaxerxes III's aid to the city of Perinthus when it was resisting Philip. 

Go (game)<====>64971<====>Go (game)Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players, in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent. The game was invented in ancient China more than 2,500 years ago and is believed to be the oldest board game continuously played today.    It was considered one of the four essential arts of the cultured aristocratic Chinese scholars in antiquity.  The earliest written reference to the game is generally recognized as the historical annal Zuo Zhuan    Fairbairn 1995    (c.  4th century BC). 

Angiogenesis<====>64972<====>Angiogenesis Angiogenesis is the physiological process through which new blood vessels form from pre-existing vessels.   In precise usage this is distinct from vasculogenesis, which is the de novo formation of endothelial cells from mesoderm cell precursors,    and from neovascularization, although discussions are not always precise (especially in older texts).  The first vessels in the developing embryo form through vasculogenesis, after which angiogenesis is responsible for most, if not all, blood vessel growth during development and in disease.    Angiogenesis is a normal and vital process in growth and development, as well as in wound healing and in the formation of granulation tissue. 

Amiga 600<====>64975<====>Amiga 600 The Amiga 600, also known as the A600 (codenamed "June Bug" after a B-52s song), is a home computer that was introduced at the CeBIT show in March 1992.  The A600 is Commodore International's final model based on the Motorola 68000 CPU and the ECS chipset.  It is essentially a redesign of the Amiga 500 Plus, with the option of an internal hard disk drive and a PCMCIA port.  A notable aspect of the A600 is its small size.  Lacking a numeric keypad, the A600 is only slightly larger than a standard PC keyboard (14" wide by 9. 

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder<====>64976<====>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder   Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a mental disorder of the neurodevelopmental type.   It is characterized by problems paying attention, excessive activity, or difficulty controlling behavior which is not appropriate for a person's age.The symptoms appear before a person is twelve years old, are present for more than six months, and cause problems in at least two settings (such as school, home, or recreational activities).   In children, problems paying attention may result in poor school performance. 

Barn-owl<====>64977<====>Barn-owl  Barn owls (family Tytonidae) are one of the two families of owls, the other being the true owls or typical owls, Strigidae.  They are medium to large owls with large heads and characteristic heart-shaped faces.  They have long, strong legs with powerful talons.  They also differ from the Strigidae in structural details relating in particular to the sternum and feet.  The barn owls are a wide-ranging family, although they are absent from northern North America, Saharan Africa, and large areas of Asia.  They live in a wide range of habitats from deserts to forests, and from temperate latitudes to the tropics. 

Boggart<====>64980<====>Boggart  Boggart is one of numerous related terms used in English folklore for either a household spirit or a malevolent genius loci inhabiting fields, marshes or other topographical features.  Other names of this group include bug, bugbear, bogey, bogeyman, bogle, etc. , presumably all derived from (or related to) Old English pūcel, Irish púca and Welsh bwg  with the same meaning (itself a probable loan from the English bug).  The household form causes mischief and things to disappear, milk to sour, and dogs to go lame.  The boggarts inhabiting marshes or holes in the ground are often attributed more serious evil doing, such as the abduction of children. 

Baloch people<====>64985<====>Baloch peopleThe Baloch or Baluch (Balochi:  ) are a people who live mainly in the Balochistan region of the southeastern-most edge of the Iranian plateau in Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan, as well as in the Arabian Peninsula. They mainly speak the Balochi language, a branch of Northwestern Iranian languages, and are an Iranic people.  About 50% of the total Baloch population live in Balochistan, a western province of Pakistan;  40% of Baloch are settled in Sindh; and a significant number of Baloch people in Punjab of Pakistan.  They make up nearly 3. 

Factsheet Five<====>64989<====>Factsheet Five Factsheet Five was a periodical mostly consisting of short reviews of privately produced printed matter along with contact details of the editors and publishers.  In the 1980s and early 1990s, its comprehensive reviews (literally thousands in each issue) made it the most important publication in its field, heralding the wider spread of what would eventually be called fanzine or zine culture. Before the widespread adoption of the web and e-mail beginning around 1994, publications such as Factsheet Five formed a vital directory for connecting like-minded people.  It was the literary equivalent to such phenomena as International Sound Communication in the period of cassette culture. 

Cassette culture<====>64991<====>Cassette cultureCassette culture, or the cassette underground,  refers to the practices surrounding amateur production and distribution of recorded music that emerged in the late 1970s via home-made audio cassettes.   It is characterized by the adoption of home recording by independent artists, and involvement in ad-hoc self-distribution and promotion networks—primarily conducted through mail (though there were a few retail outlets, such as Rough Trade and Falling A in the UK) and fanzines.   The culture was in part an offshoot of the mail art movement of the 1970s and 1980s,  and participants engaged in tape trading in addition to traditional sales. 

Christian Democratic Appeal<====>64992<====>Christian Democratic Appeal  The Christian Democratic Appeal ( ,  ; CDA) is a Christian-democratic   political party in the Netherlands.  The CDA was originally formed in 1977 from a confederation of the Catholic People's Party, the Anti-Revolutionary Party and the Christian Historical Union,  and has participated in all but three governments since then.  Sybrand van Haersma Buma has been the Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal since 18 May 2012. The party suffered severe losses in the 2010 general election, losing half of its seats and falling to fourth place in the House of Representatives. 

Skin cancer<====>64993<====>Skin cancer  Skin cancers are cancers that arise from the skin.  They are due to the development of abnormal cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body.   There are three main types of skin cancers: basal-cell skin cancer (BCC), squamous-cell skin cancer (SCC) and melanoma.The first two, along with a number of less common skin cancers, are known as nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Basal-cell cancer grows slowly and can damage the tissue around it but is unlikely to spread to distant areas or result in death. 

Lodi, Lombardy<====>64996<====>Lodi, Lombardy  Lodi ( ; Lombard: Lòd) is a city and comune in Lombardy, northern Italy, on primarily on the western bank of the River Adda.  It is the capital of the province of Lodi. HistoryLodi was a Celtic village; in Roman times it was called, in Latin, Laus Pompeia (probably in honour of the consul Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo) and was known also because its position allowed many Gauls of Gallia Cisalpina to obtain Roman citizenship.  It was in an important position where a vital Roman road crossed the River Adda. Lodi became the see of a diocese in the 3rd century. 

Kaiju<====>64998<====>Kaiju    (from Japanese "strange beast")  is a Japanese film genre that features giant monsters, usually attacking major cities and engaging the military and other monsters in battle.  It is a subgenre of tokusatsu (special effects-based) entertainment.  This word originated from Shan Hai Jing (Classic of Mountains and Seas).   OriginsKaiju originally referred to the monsters from ancient Japanese legends before the arrival of writing.   But there are no traditional depictions of kaiju or kaiju-like creatures in Japanese folklore but rather the origins of kaiju are found in film.   Gojira (transliterated to Godzilla) is regarded as the first kaiju film and was released in 1954. 

Gamera<====>65001<====>Gamera  Daiei's Gamera series Gamera   Gamera as featured in Gamera: The Giant Monster (1965) First appearance Gamera: The Giant Monster (1965) Last appearance Gamera the Brave (2006) Created by Yonejiro Saito Portrayed by: Shōwa series Teruo Aragaki Umenosuke Izumi Heisei series Naoaki Manabe Jun Suzuki Akira Ohashi Hirofumi Fukuzawa Millennium Toshinori Sasaki Species Giant prehistoric turtle Alias The Invincible Super Monster Guardian of the Universe The Last Hope The Brave The Absolute Guardian of the Universe Friend Of All Children Guardian Supermonster   Gamera ( ガメラ ) is a fictional giant monster or kaiju originating from a series of Japanese tokusatsu films of the same name. He first appeared in Daiei Film's 1965 film Gamera: The Giant Monster, which was initially produced to rival the success of Toho's Godzilla; however, Gamera has gained fame and notoriety as a Japanese icon in his own right.  The character has appeared in other media such as comic books and video games.In the United States, Gamera attained prominence during the 1970s due to the burgeoning popularity of UHF television stations featuring Saturday afternoon matinee showcases like Creature Double Feature and later in the 1990s when five Gamera films were featured on the TV show Mystery Science Theater 3000.OverviewAppearanceGamera has the general configuration of a turtle, albeit a tremendously large one that is capable of walking on two legs and flying. He does occasionally walk on all four legs in his first three films. Gamera demonstrates the ability to manipulate objects with his forefeet. He possesses a pronounced sagittal crest on top of his head and his mouth is filled with teeth, which is unprecedented in turtles – with the exception perhaps of the prehistoric turtles Proganochelys and Odontochelys – plus a pair of large tusks protruding upward from the lower jaw.OriginsIn the Shōwa series, Gamera was a titanic, fire-breathing, prehistoric species of turtle who fed on flames, coal, magma, petroleum-based materials and other flammable substances conducive for producing heat or combustion, presumably giving him the ability to breathe fire and fly by "jets" ignited when the monster retracts his legs   he can then propel himself by rising up into and spinning through the air with all four legs in and (as shown in later films) can fly straight with just the rear legs drawn inside his shell.The original movie begins showing bombers of the USSR being intercepted by American fighters over US air space in the Arctic. The Soviet pilots refuse to be forced down because of the presence of atomic bombs on board their aircraft, so they attempt to leave the area. However, the fighters launch an attack and one of the bombers crashes. A nuclear blast ensues, releasing a giant turtle from suspended animation in the ice.The incident unfolds over the heads of a Japanese research team who have stumbled upon an Eskimo tribe in possession of an artifact, an ancient stone etching, that suggests the giant turtle (maybe more than one) had been observed and duly noted at some earlier time in mankind's history. The tribe refers to the turtle as "Gamera" in their legends.In the Heisei series, starting with Gamera: Guardian of the Universe (1995), the origin of Gamera was tweaked in order to make the theme much more directly heroic: a bio-engineered Guardian of the Universe created by Atlantis with the purpose of defeating Gyaos, another ancient creation capable of killing all human life. The giant turtle is found floating adrift in the Pacific, encased in rock and mistaken for an atoll. Within the rock, investigators discover a large monolith explaining Gamera's purpose, as well as dozens of orichalcum magatama, which allow a psychic link between Gamera and humans.In the third film of the series, Gamera 3: The Revenge of Iris (1999), an undersea graveyard is found with many other Gamera fossils, suggesting that Gamera was not the only member of his kind created. One character in the film refers to these fossils as "beta versions" of Gamera, possible failures in Atlantis' attempts to create the final version. Another scene provides Gamera with a link to Asian folklore, with a character relating a story in which a giant turtle is considered the Guardian of the North, with separate rival creatures defending the East, West and South.Gamera's continuity was rebooted again in 2006 with Gamera the Brave. The film begins with the original Gamera sacrificing himself to destroy three Gyaos in 1973. 33 years later, a young boy finds a strange, glowing red rock near his home with a small egg lying on top of it. A fairly normal-looking baby turtle soon hatches from the egg, but begins to grow at an alarming rate. The turtle, now named "Toto" by his pre-adolescent owner, quickly develops Gamera's classic abilities to breathe fire and fly and attempts to ward off another attacking monster, Zedus, but is too weak to succeed. Only after eating the glowing rock found with his egg does the new Gamera achieve his full power, defeating Zedus and flying off into the sky.A new film, simply titled Gamera, was planned for release in 2016, the 50th anniversary year of the series, being a third reboot of the franchise. A proof-of-concept trailer was released by Kadokawa on October 8, 2015 at the New York Comic Con,  showing Gamera fighting a horde of Gyaos ten years before the present day and challenging a new monster ten years later. The new film has still not been made as of 2017.CapabilitiesGamera's shell is extremely resilient and strong. Missiles and other weaponry merely bounce off of it, along with most of his opponents' attacks. There have been a few times where his shell has faltered, most notably when the alien monster Guiron hammered at the same spot several times and began cutting through. The flying monster Gyaos' sonic beam, the alien shark Zigra's paralyzing beam and the mutant lizard Barugon's rainbow ray could not penetrate Gamera's shell, shown in the films when he withdraws into his shell to avoid the attacks, although Gamera will involuntarily stretch his neck out of his shell if it is hit hard enough, once again seen during the fight with Guiron. Gamera's underbelly, however, is softer and not as resilient and he has been cut and gouged in his stomach to the point of violently bleeding.In the Showa series, Gamera fed on fire and was attracted by other heat sources such as power plants and Barugon's rainbow ray. He could breathe intensely hot streams of flame from his mouth when caught in a more serious situation. The Heisei version, on the other hand, could blast off mighty plasma fireballs from his mouth, usually very quickly and with varying accuracy; they were highly explosive. The Heisei version could also absorb a great deal of mana, or the living essence of Earth, and release an extremely powerful stream of pure plasma from his chest. In the final film of the Heisei series, Gamera blasted his own arm off and absorbed plasma fireballs shot by the Southern Guardian monster Iris, then used his stump to grow back his arm in a plasmic form.Gamera also has the ability to fly. Generally, Gamera pulls in his arms, legs, head and tail into his shell, emits flames out of his arm and leg cavities, then rises up into and spins around through the air like a flying saucer. This mode of flight had an added advantage in the later films, where he used the sharp edges of his shell to cut enemies while spinning, similar to a circular saw. He has a second way of flying where he only pulls in his legs and/or tail, fires flames from the leg cavities and flies like a jet plane. In the Heisei era films, Gamera's arms would extend and stretch out into wing-like limbs similar to the flippers of a sea turtle whilst using this form of flight, giving him added aerodynamics and control.The Heisei films gave Gamera one more additional weapon: a pair of sharp spikes protruding from his elbows. In his first Heisei appearance, these spikes were hidden during the majority of the film, extending only when needed in battle. In the later appearances they were permanently extended.When seriously or gravely injured, Gamera can enter a coma-like state in order to heal. This often fools his opponents into thinking that he is dead. This ability has been used in almost every Gamera film.Gamera's only major weakness is cold. Barugon was able to achieve success against Gamera by using its freeze-gas from his tongue and scientists nearly defeated Gamera during his first appearance using special freeze bombs. This weakness was only shown in Gamera's first two films.Film historyShōwa period (1965-1980)Gamera made his first appearance in 1965's Gamera: The Giant Monster, which was also the only Gamera film in the entire series to be shot in black and white. In 1966, the movie was released in America as Gammera the Invincible. Subsequent films, usually directed by Noriaki Yuasa and written by Nisan Takahashi, quickly became a big hit with children, who loved watching Gamera fight other monsters. A total of seven films were produced on a one-film-a-year basis between 1965 and 1971. An eighth entry was slated for a 1972 release, tentatively titled Gamera vs. Garasharp.   Gross mismanagement of Daiei, however, put the company into bankruptcy and the Gamera films were forced to cease production.After Daiei was purchased by Tokuma Shoten in 1974, the new management wanted to do a new Gamera film in 1980, so Gamera: Super Monster was produced. The filmmakers were forced to make the movie because of the contract for one more Gamera film that they owed at Daiei. The majority of the film used stock footage (with limited new scenes of Gamera flying) and acted as a "recap" of Gamera's history. However, when production of the film began, Yuasa saw how poorly Tokuma Shoten was handling things and knew that Gamera's reputation could never recover from the film, so he had Takahashi rewrite the ending into one where Gamera was killed at the end.Heisei period (1995-1999)Starting with Gamera: Guardian of the Universe (1995), three Gyaos are discovered on a remote island. The Japanese government discovers that they are all female and decides that since they are the last of their kind, they should be captured and studied. Meanwhile, a search has been assembled for a moving atoll in the Pacific. They find it, small gems made of an unknown metal and a stone sticking up out of the center of it. They manage to take pictures and collect some of the strange gems, but the stone crumbles and the atoll takes off towards Japan at high speeds. It ends up that the atoll is actually an ancient monster, made by the Atlanteans, called Gamera. He attacks the Gyaos, killing two, but one escapes. The remaining Gyaos grows to Gamera-like proportions and the two battle. Gamera manages to defeat his foe and heads out to sea.In Gamera 2: Attack of Legion (1996), Earth was attacked by an alien force known as Legion.In Gamera 3: The Revenge of Iris (1999), Gamera had to face hordes of Gyaos and his ultimate foe, Iris.Millennium period (2006)Gamera the Brave (2006) returns Gamera to his Showa roots, but with a modern twist. In the film, Gamera is first seen defending Japan back in 1973 from three Gyaos, but sacrifices his life to destroy them by self-destructing. Thirty-three years later, in 2006, the child of a man who witnessed that battle finds an egg that hatches into a baby Gamera that he names Toto. When a giant lizard monster named Zedus appears, Toto tries to fight the beast, but ends up being gravely wounded and taken by the military for study. He ends up escaping and growing to a larger size to try and fight Zedus again, this time succeeding against the monster.RebootIn March 2014, Anime News Network reported that a new Gamera production was planned, with no release date specified.  On October 8, 2015, Kadokawa-Daiei Studios' senior managing director Tsuyoshi Kikuchi and producer Shinichiro Inoue screened a proof-of-concept trailer at the New York Comic Con, revealing plans to commemorate the Gamera franchise's 50th anniversary by producing a new film reboot, simply titled Gamera, to be directed by Katsuhito Ishii.  The proof-of-concept trailer featured a newly designed Gamera, a swarm of Gyaos and a new monster, all of which were completely created and rendered via CGI.  As of 2017, the planned reboot film has still not been made.FilmsShowa SeriesFilm Original release date Notes Availability Gamera: The Giant Monster November 27, 1965 The first Gamera film, the first and only Gamera film to be made in black and white and the only solo Gamera film.

ComicsDark Horse Comics published a four-issue miniseries based on Gamera called Gamera the Guardian of the Universe in 1996.  The comic served as a follow-up to the film of the same name and featured classic monsters including Zigra, Viras and the Heisei incarnation of Gyaos. The characters Mayumi Nagamine and Asagi Kusanagi were also featured in the comic, however, Asagi only had a minor supporting role.Akira Toriyama's manga series Dr. Slump features Gamera in book 4, considerably smaller than he is portrayed in films or other comic books.Gamera also makes an appearance in another manga by Toriyama, Dragon Ball. Here, too, he was smaller than usually portrayed. He is summoned to help Kame-Sennin traverse the ocean to Fry-Pan Mountain in volume 2.Gamera also appears in the Kinnikuman manga series.TelevisionThe Justice League Unlimited episode "Chaos at the Earth's Core" features a monster very similar to Gamera, in both appearance and abilities, that fights League members Green Lantern, S.T.R.I.P.E., and Stargirl.Mystery Science Theater 3000 aired Gamera vs. Zigra.

The Big U<====>65002<====>The Big U  The Big U (1984) is Neal Stephenson's first published novel, a satire of campus life. Plot  The story chronicles the disillusionment of a number of young intellectuals as they encounter the realities of the higher education establishment parodied in the story.  Over time their lives and sanity disintegrate in different ways through a series of escalating events that culminates with a full-scale civil war raging on the campus of American Megaversity. Told in first person from the perspective of Bud, a lecturer in Remote Sensing new to the university, the book attacks and makes fun of just about every conceivable group at university, though its portraits of the nerds/computer scientists/role players tend to be more detailed than those of other factions. 

Shub-Niggurath<====>65008<====>Shub-NiggurathFor the French zeuhl band named after it, see Shub-Niggurath (band). Shub-Niggurath, often associated with the phrase “The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young”, is a deity in the Cthulhu Mythos of H.  P.  Lovecraft.   The only other name by which H.  P.  Lovecraft referred to her was "Lord of the Wood" in his story "The Whisperer in Darkness". Shub-Niggurath is first mentioned in Lovecraft's revision story "The Last Test" (1928); she is not described by Lovecraft, but is frequently mentioned or called upon in incantations.  Most of her development as a literary figure was carried out by other Mythos authors, including August Derleth, Robert Bloch, and Ramsey Campbell. 

Damselfly<====>65009<====>Damselfly  Damselflies are insects of the suborder Zygoptera in the order Odonata.  They are similar to dragonflies, which constitute the other odonatan suborder, Anisoptera, but are smaller, have slimmer bodies, and most species fold the wings along the body when at rest.  An ancient group, damselflies have existed since at least the Lower Permian, and are found on every continent except Antarctica. All damselflies are predatory; both nymphs and adults eat other insects.  The nymphs are aquatic, with different species living in a variety of freshwater habitats including acid bogs, ponds, lakes and rivers.  The nymphs moult repeatedly, at the last moult climbing out of the water to undergo metamorphosis.

Billi 99<====>65013<====>Billi 99 Billi 99 is a four-issue comic book limited series published by Dark Horse Comics in 1991, which was later reprinted in 2002.  It was written by Sarah Byam and illustrated by Tim Sale.  It is among Tim Sale's earliest published work. The tag line for Billi 99, as seen in comic ads in Fall 1991, reads, "It's 1999. . .  Do You Know Where Your Civil Rights Are? Billi 99 A Prayer in Four Parts".  The story was inspired by Byam's experiences in Detroit in the 1980s, a love of the heroic stories and pessimism over the reactionary political movements of the time. 

Swamp Thing<====>65015<====>Swamp Thing   {{Infobox comics character and title }}The Swamp Thing (Dr.  Alec Holland) is a fictional character and antihero in comic books published by DC Comics.   He is a humanoid/plant elemental creature, created by writer Len Wein and artist Bernie Wrightson.  Swamp Thing has had several humanoid or monster incarnations in various different storylines.  He first appeared in House of Secrets #92 (July 1971) in a stand-alone horror story set in the early 20th century.   The character then returned in a solo series, set in the contemporary world and in the general DC continuity. 

William Hope Hodgson<====>65017<====>William Hope Hodgson  William Hope Hodgson (15 November 1877 – April 1918) was an English author.  He produced a large body of work, consisting of essays, short fiction, and novels, spanning several overlapping genres including horror, fantastic fiction, and science fiction.   Hodgson used his experiences at sea to lend authentic detail to his short horror stories, many of which are set on the ocean, including his series of linked tales forming the "Sargasso Sea Stories".  His novels, such as The House on the Borderland (1908) and The Night Land (1912), feature more cosmic themes, but several of his novels also focus on horrors associated with the sea. 

Adapter pattern<====>65020<====>Adapter pattern In software engineering, the adapter pattern is a software design pattern (also known as Wrapper, an alternative naming shared with the Decorator pattern) that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface.   It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code. An example is an adapter that converts the interface of a Document Object Model of an XML document into a tree structure that can be displayed. OverviewThe Adapter design pattern is one of the twenty-three well-known GoF design patterns that describe how to solve recurring design problems to design flexible and reusable object-oriented software, that is, objects that are easier to implement, change, test, and reuse.

Facade pattern<====>65028<====>Facade patternThe facade pattern (also spelled façade) is a software design pattern commonly used with object-oriented programming.  The name is an analogy to an architectural façade. A facade is an object that provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code, such as a class library.  A facade canmake a software library easier to use, understand, and test, since the facade has convenient methods for common tasks,make the library more readable, for the same reason,  reduce dependencies of outside code on the inner workings of a library, since most code uses the facade, thus allowing more flexibility in developing the system,wrap a poorly designed collection of APIs with a single well-designed API. 

Versatackle knot<====>65029<====>Versatackle knotA versatackle is a self-locking tensioning structure implemented in cordage.  It consists of two loops with the rope passed back and forth between them.  It is functionally similar to the trucker's hitch, however, unlike the trucker's hitch, the versatackle is self-locking under tension. The pressure, friction, and heat that may be generated by the running end moving through the loops can accelerate wear at the loops.

George McFarland<====>65032<====>George McFarland   George "Spanky" McFarland (October 2, 1928 – June 30, 1993) was an American actor most famous for his appearances as a child in the Our Gang series of short-subject comedies of the 1930s and 1940s.  The Our Gang shorts were later syndicated to television as The Little Rascals. Early lifeMcFarland was born in Dallas, Texas, on October 2, 1928 to Virginia Winifred (née Phillips) and Robert Emmett McFarland.   He had three siblings: Thomas ("Tommy," who appeared in a few Our Gang episodes as "Dynamite"), Amanda, and Roderick ("Rod").  He attended Lancaster High School in Lancaster, TX. 

Bridge pattern<====>65033<====>Bridge patternThe bridge pattern is a design pattern used in software engineering that is meant to "decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently", introduced by the Gang of Four.   The bridge uses encapsulation, aggregation, and can use inheritance to separate responsibilities into different classes. When a class varies often, the features of object-oriented programming become very useful because changes to a program's code can be made easily with minimal prior knowledge about the program.  The bridge pattern is useful when both the class and what it does vary often.  The class itself can be thought of as the abstraction and what the class can do as the implementation. 

Tire<====>65037<====>Tire   A tire (American English) or tyre (British English; see spelling differences) is a ring-shaped component that surrounds a wheel's rim to transfer a vehicle's load from the axle through the wheel to the ground and to provide traction on the surface traveled over.  Most tires, such as those for automobiles and bicycles, are pneumatically inflated structures, which also provide a flexible cushion that absorbs shock as the tire rolls over rough features on the surface.  Tires provide a footprint that is designed to match the weight of the vehicle with the bearing strength of the surface that it rolls over by providing a bearing pressure that will not deform the surface excessively. 

Muskeg<====>65039<====>Muskeg Muskeg ( ;  , lit.  moss bog) is an acidic soil type common in Arctic and boreal areas, although it is found in other northern climates as well.  Muskeg is approximately synonymous with bogland, but "muskeg" is the standard term in Western Canada and Alaska, while 'bog' is common elsewhere.  The term became common in these areas because it is of Cree origin; maskek (ᒪᐢᑫᐠ) meaning low-lying marsh.   Large tracts of this soil existing in Siberia may be called muskeg or bogland interchangeably.  Muskeg consists of dead plants in various states of decomposition (as peat), ranging from fairly intact sphagnum moss, to sedge peat, to highly decomposed humus.

Singleton pattern<====>65041<====>Singleton patternIn software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object.  This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.  The concept is sometimes generalized to systems that operate more efficiently when only one object exists, or that restrict the instantiation to a certain number of objects.  The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton. There are some who are critical of the singleton pattern and consider it to be an anti-pattern in that it is frequently used in scenarios where it is not beneficial, introduces unnecessary restrictions in situations where a sole instance of a class is not actually required, and introduces global state into an application.

Monster<====>65071<====>Monster   A monster is a creature that produces fear or physical harm by its appearance or its actions.  Derived from the Latin monstrum, the word usually connotes something wrong or evil; a monster is generally morally objectionable, physically or psychologically hideous, or a freak of nature.  They are usually composites of different creatures, or hybrids of humans and animals, but the term can also be applied figuratively to describe someone with similar characteristics, such as a person who does cruel or horrific things. Monsters pre-date written history, but do not emerge from a cultural void.  Instead, they have their origins in a society's literary and cultural heritage, the academic study of which is known as monstrophy. 

Triticale<====>65085<====>Triticale Triticale (× Triticosecale),   is a hybrid of wheat (Triticum) and rye (Secale) first bred in laboratories during the late 19th century in Scotland and Germany.   Commercially available triticale is almost always a second-generation hybrid, i. e. , a cross between two kinds of primary (first-cross) triticales.  As a rule, triticale combines the yield potential and grain quality of wheat with the disease and environmental tolerance (including soil conditions) of rye.  Only recently has it been developed into a commercially viable crop.  Depending on the cultivar, triticale can more or less resemble either of its parents. 

Brian Froud<====>65086<====>Brian Froud   Brian Froud (born 1947) is an English fantasy illustrator.  He lives and works in Devon with his wife, Wendy Froud, who is also a fantasy artist.  The landscapes in his paintings are frequently inspired by Dartmoor. CareerFroud was the conceptual designer and costume designer for the films The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth (both in conjunction with Jim Henson's Creature Shop).  He collaborated with Terry Jones, who was a screenwriter on Labyrinth, on The Goblins of the Labyrinth (1986, re-issued in abridged form as The Goblin Companion: A Field Guide to Goblins in 1996), and subsequently on a number of non-Labyrinth-related books about fairies and goblins, namely of the "Lady Cottington" series, such as Lady Cottington's Pressed Fairy Book. 

Pika<====>65091<====>Pika  A pika (   ; archaically spelled pica) is a small mammal, with short limbs, very round body, rounded ears, and no external tail.  They resemble their close cousin the rabbit, but with shorter ears.  They live in mountainous countries in Asia, with two species also in North America.  Most pikas prefer rocky slopes.  The large-eared pika of the Himalayas and nearby mountains is one of the highest living mammals, found at heights of more than  .  Pikas graze on a range of plants, mostly grasses, flowers and young stems.  In the autumn, they pull hay, soft twigs and other stores of food into their burrows to eat during the long, cold winter.

Ida Rentoul Outhwaite, also known as  Ida Sherbourne Rentoul and Ida Sherbourne Outhwaite    (9 June 1888  – 25 June 1960), was an Australian illustrator of children's books.  Her work mostly depicted fairies. Ida was born in Carlton, Victoria, the youngest child of four and second daughter of the Rev.  Dr.  John Laurence Rentoul,  an Irish-born Presbyterian minister and academic, and his wife Annie Isobel (née Rattray).  At the time of her birth Outhwaite's father was a professor at Ormond College, University of Melbourne, and later moderator-general of his church for 1912-14, and when the World War I broke out, chaplain-general of the Australian military forces. 

Richard Dadd<====>65096<====>Richard Dadd   Richard Dadd (1 August 1817 – 7 January 1886) was an English painter of the Victorian era, noted for his depictions of fairies and other supernatural subjects, Orientalist scenes, and enigmatic genre scenes, rendered with obsessively minuscule detail.  Most of the works for which he is best known were created while he was a patient in psychiatric hospitals. Early lifeDadd was born at Chatham, Kent, England, the son of a chemist.  He was educated at King's School, Rochester where his aptitude for drawing was evident at an early age, leading to his admission to the Royal Academy of Arts at the age of 20. 

Cicely Mary Barker<====>65100<====>Cicely Mary Barker Cicely Mary Barker (28 June 1895 – 16 February 1973) was an English illustrator best known for a series of fantasy illustrations depicting fairies and flowers.  Barker's art education began in girlhood with correspondence courses and instruction at the Croydon School of Art.  Her earliest professional work included greeting cards and juvenile magazine illustrations, and her first book, Flower Fairies of the Spring, was published in 1923.  Similar books were published in the following decades. Barker was a devout Anglican, and donated her artworks to Christian fundraisers and missionary organizations.  She produced a few Christian-themed books such as The Children’s Book of Hymns and, in collaboration with her sister Dorothy, He Leadeth Me. 

Thomas the Rhymer<====>65102<====>Thomas the Rhymer    Sir Thomas de Ercildoun, better remembered as Thomas the Rhymer (fl.  c.  1220 – 1298   ), also known as Thomas of Learmont or True Thomas, was a Scottish laird and reputed prophet from Earlston (then called "Erceldoune") in the Borders.   Thomas' gift of prophecy is linked to his poetic ability.  It is not clear if the name Rhymer was his actual surname or merely a sobriquet.  He is often cited as the author of the English Sir Tristrem, a version of the Tristram legend, and some lines in Robert Mannyng's Chronicle may be the source of this association. 

Great Ocean Road<====>65104<====>Great Ocean Road   The Great Ocean Road is an Australian National Heritage listed   stretch of road along the south-eastern coast of Australia between the Victorian cities of Torquay and Allansford.  Built by returned soldiers between 1919 and 1932 and dedicated to soldiers killed during World War I, the road is the world's largest war memorial.  Winding through varying terrain along the coast and providing access to several prominent landmarks, including the Twelve Apostles limestone stack formations, the road is an important tourist attraction in the region.

Poplog<====>65118<====>PoplogPoplog is a reflective, incrementally compiled software development environment for the programming languages POP-11, Common Lisp, Prolog, and Standard ML, originally created in the UK for teaching and research in artificial intelligence at the University of Sussex. HistoryAfter an incremental compiler for Prolog had been added to an implementation of POP-11, the name Poplog was adopted, to reflect the fact that it supported programming in both languages.  The name was retained, as a trade mark of the University of Sussex, when the system was later extended as incremental compilers were added for Lisp and Standard ML. For some time after 1983, Poplog was sold and supported internationally as a commercial product, by Systems Designers Ltd, whose name changed as ownership changed.

Hobo<====>65178<====>Hobo A hobo is a migrant worker or homeless vagabond, especially one who is impoverished.  The term originated in the Western—probably Northwestern—United States around 1890.Unlike a "tramp", who works only when forced to, and a "bum", who does not work at all, a "hobo" is a traveling worker. EtymologyThe origin of the term is unknown.  According to etymologist Anatoly Liberman, the only certain detail about its origin is the word was first noticed in American English circa 1890.   Liberman points out that many folk etymologies fail to answer the question: "Why did the word become widely known in California (just there) by the early Nineties (just then)?"   Author Todd DePastino has suggested it may be derived from the term hoe-boy meaning "farmhand", or a greeting such as Ho, boy!  Bill Bryson suggests in Made in America (1998) that it could either come from the railroad greeting, "Ho, beau!" or a syllabic abbreviation of "homeward bound".

Kimura spider<====>65195<====>Kimura spider The Kimura spider, or kimura-gumo in Japanese, Heptathela kimurai, is an Old World spider, found primarily in Japan and named after Arika Kimura, who collected it in 1920.  It belongs to the sub-order Mesothelae (primitive burrowing spiders) and can reach up to 3 cm in length.  Its burrows are covered by a camouflaged "pill box" flap. Like other species of mesothele spiders, the ancestral traits of the Kimura spider include central spinnerets and signs of segmentation on the abdomen.

Kickflip<====>65201<====>Kickflip The kickflip is a maneuver in skateboarding in which a rider flips their skateboard 360° along the axis that extends from the nose to the tail of the deck.  When the rider is regular footed the board spins clockwise if viewed from the front. It was the first of many modern flip tricks to be invented or modified by Rodney Mullen in the early 1980s.  The original kickflip was invented by pioneer Curt Lindgren prior to 1978 and was later modified and popularized by Mullen.  In March 2011, the first kickflip in surfing was landed by Zoltan "The Magician" Torkos. 

Heelflip<====>65202<====>HeelflipThe heelflip (a. k. a.  heel or heelie), is an aerial skateboarding trick where the skateboarder kicks out in front of him/her flipping board 360 degrees along the board's long axis. A heelflip is executed similarly to the ollie, and like the Ollie has become a defining trick of "New School" skateboarding . Execution A heelflip is the opposite of a kickflip, the board spins toe-side (towards the toes).  For a regular skater (left foot in front) the board spins clockwise from the perspective of one behind the skater.  Again, there is a kick as part of the ollie but unlike the kickflip it is directed forward and outwards away from the rider's toe side (diagonal), so that the last part of the foot to leave the board is the heel, hence the name.

344 BC<====>65207<====>344 BC    Year 344 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.  At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Rutilus and Torquatus (or, less frequently, year 410 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 344 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. Events By placePersian EmpireThe king of Caria, Idrieus, dies, leaving the Persian satrapy, by his will, to his sister Ada, to whom he was married. GreeceThe Athenian statesman, Demosthenes, travels to Peloponnesus, in order to detach as many cities as possible from Macedon's influence, but his efforts are generally unsuccessful. 

Hlothhere of Kent<====>65209<====>Hlothhere of Kent Hlothhere ( ; died 6 February 685) was a King of Kent who ruled from 673 to 685.  He succeeded his brother Ecgberht I in 673.  He must have come into conflict with Mercia, since in 676 the Mercian king Æthelred invaded Kent and caused great destruction; according to Bede, even churches and monasteries were not spared, and Rochester was laid waste. Hlothhere's rule survived this onslaught, however.  He appears for a time to have reigned jointly with his nephew Eadric, son of Ecgberht I, since a code of laws still extant was issued under both their names. 

Hapkido<====>65212<====>Hapkido    Hapkido ( RP:,,  also spelled hap ki do or hapki-do; from Korean hapgido  ) is a highly eclectic Korean martial art.  It is a form of self-defense that employs joint locks, grappling, and throwing techniques similar to those of other martial arts, as well as kicks, punches, and other striking attacks.  It also teaches the use of traditional weapons, including knife, sword, rope, ssang juhl bong (nunchaku), cane (ji pang ee), short stick (dan bong), and middle-length staff (joong bong, gun (analogous to the Japanese jō), and bō (Japanese)), which vary in emphasis depending on the particular tradition examined. 

Cabinda Province<====>65213<====>Cabinda Province   {{Infobox settlement }}Cabinda (also spelled Kabinda, formerly called Portuguese Congo, known locally as Tchiowa) is an exclave and province of Angola, a status that has been disputed by several political organizations in the territory.  The capital city is also called Cabinda.  The province is divided into four municipalities—Belize, Buco-Zau, Cabinda and Cacongo. Modern Cabinda is the result of a fusion of three kingdoms: N'Goyo, Loango and Kakongo.  It has an area of   and a population of 688,285 (2014 census).  According to 1988 United States government statistics, the total population of the province was 147,200, with a near even split between rural and urban populations.

The northern Pillar, Calpe Mons, is the Rock of Gibraltar (part of the British overseas territory of Gibraltar).  A corresponding North African peak not being predominant, the identity of the southern Pillar, Abila Mons, has been disputed throughout history,  with the two most likely candidates being Monte Hacho in Ceuta and Jebel Musa in Morocco.

He first went to Paris with the family of his then-girlfriend, Serena, whom he married in 1939, and then to the United States. 

Saving<====>65228<====>Saving Saving is income not spent, or deferred consumption.  Methods of saving include putting money aside in, for example, a deposit account, a pension account, an investment fund, or as cash.   Saving also involves reducing expenditures, such as recurring costs.  In terms of personal finance, saving generally specifies low-risk preservation of money, as in a deposit account, versus investment, wherein risk is a lot higher; in economics more broadly, it refers to any income not used for immediate consumption. Saving differs from savings.  The former refers to the act of increasing one's assets, whereas the latter refers to one part of one's assets, usually deposits in savings accounts, or to all of one's assets. 

Manwë<====>65235<====>Manwë    Manwë   is a fictional character in J.  R.  R.  Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium.  He appears in The Silmarillion. Manwë was the King of the Valar, husband of Varda Elentári, was conceived in the thought of Iluvatar as a brother of Melkor, and King of Arda.   He lived atop Mount Taniquetil, the highest mountain of the world, in the halls of Ilmarin, in the realm of Valinor.  The winds, airs and birds were his servants, and he was lord of air, wind, and clouds in Arda.  He was the noblest and greatest in authority of the Valar, and only less powerful than Melkor. 

Ulmo<====>65236<====>Ulmo   Ulmo   (from the Valarin Ulubôz, Ullubôz via Ulumō) is a fictional character in J.  R.  R.  Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium.  He first appears in The Silmarillion as a god or Vala of the Elven pantheon.  Ulmo is a title, which means He who pours.  He is also known as King of the Sea and Lord of Waters.  Ulmo is similar to the god Poseidon in Greek mythology, Neptune in Roman mythology, Ægir in Norse mythology, and Manannan in Celtic mythology.  Ulmo was one of the chief architects of Arda (the world). 

Aulë<====>65237<====>Aulë   Aulë   is a fictional character from J.  R.  R.  Tolkien's legendarium, who is primarily discussed in The Silmarillion, but appears also in Tolkien's other works.  In Tolkien's pantheon of Middle-earth, Aulë is a knowledge deity, sometimes worshipped as a god by men, representing skill and craftsmanship, who is also thematically associated with Earth, stone, metal and the dwarves.  Because of his associations with smithing and skill, Aulë is similar in thematic role to the Greek god Hephaestus, the Roman god Vulcan, the Finnish god Ilmarinen, the Yoruba god Ogun, and the Norse god Völundr. 

Arda (Tolkien)<====>65242<====>Arda (Tolkien) In J.  R.  R.  Tolkien's legendarium, Arda is the name given to the Earth in an imaginary  period of prehistory, wherein the places mentioned in The Lord of the Rings and related material once existed.  It included several seas and oceans, and the continents of Middle-earth, the Dark Lands, Aman (the Undying Lands), the island of Númenor, and other unknown lands left largely unnamed by Tolkien. Overview Arda was part of Eä, the universe of all which exists.  Arda was created, together with the rest of Eä, through the Music of the Ainur for the Children of Ilúvatar (that is, Elves and Men). 

Ossë<====>65254<====>Ossë  Ossë ( ; from the Valarin Ošošai, Oššai) is a fictional character in the works of J.  R.  R.  Tolkien.  He is introduced in The Silmarillion as an angelic being known as a Maia, associated with Ulmo, one of the Valar (analogous to archangels). A spirit of the sea in the service of Ulmo, Ossë guarded the waters around Middle-earth.  He was married to Uinen, and he was a friend of Círdan the Shipwright.  During the Years of the Trees, he briefly entered into the service of Melkor and began causing wanton storms which made traveling by sea particularly unsafe. 

Varda<====>65258<====>Varda  Varda Elentári   is a fictional character in J.  R.  R.  Tolkien's legendarium.  She appears in Tolkien's Silmarillion as one of the Valar (powers) of Middle Earth.  The longest sample of the Sindarin language published by Tolkien, is addressed to her. Character descriptionVarda is one of the Valar, the pantheon or gods in the legendarium.  She is one of the greatest of the Valar.  Being associated with light, she is central to the dualism of light and darkness in Tolkien's cosmology.  With dew from the vats of Telperion Varda made the brightest stars in the heavens, most significantly the Valacirca, The Sickle of the Valar (The Big Dipper) and Menelmacar (Orion). 

Nienna<====>65277<====>Nienna   Nienna   is a fictional character in J.  R.  R.  Tolkien's legendarium.  She is introduced in The Silmarillion as one of the Ainur (angelic beings), one of the Queens of the Valar and one of the Aratar. She was the sister of Mandos and Irmo.  Her name meant She who weeps.  She lived in the far West of Arda, grieved for the suffering of the world, and comforted the spirits of the dead who waited in the halls of Mandos: Gandalf's rebuke of Frodo for wishing death upon Gollum in The Fellowship of the Ring is obliquely attributed in The Silmarillion to Gandalf's having been a disciple of Nienna in Valinor (Chapter 2, "Valaquenta"): "Wisest of the Maiar was Olórin [Gandalf]. 

Yavanna<====>65278<====>YavannaYavanna   is a fictional character from J.  R.  R.  Tolkien's legendarium, written about in The Silmarillion.   In Tolkien's pantheon, Yavanna is the goddess of Kelvar (Fauna) and Olvar (Flora).   She is the elder sister of  Vána, and is the spouse of  Aulë.  Yavanna was responsible for the creation of the Two Trees as well as the provider of the fruit that created the Sun and the Moon, resulting in the end of the Sleep of Yavanna.  Yavanna is the creator of "all things that grow" and planted the first seeds of Arda: Following the destruction of the Two Lamps, the Valar requested that their new realm, Valinor, be lit. 

Valinor<====>65282<====>Valinor Valinor (Land of the Valar) is a fictional location in J.  R.  R.  Tolkien's legendarium, the realm of the Valar in Aman.  It was also known as the Undying Lands, along with Tol Eressëa and the outliers of Aman.  This latter name is somewhat misleading; the land itself, while blessed, did not cause mortals to live forever.   However, only immortal beings were generally allowed to reside there.  Exceptionally, the surviving bearers of the One Ring were allowed to dwell there for a time--Bilbo and Frodo Baggins and Sam Gamgee--and perhaps  Gimli son of Glóin who, it is said, accompanied his friend Legolas to Valinor. 

Aman (Tolkien)<====>65283<====>Aman (Tolkien)  Aman is a fictional place in J.  R.  R.  Tolkien's legendarium, also known as the Undying Lands or Blessed Realm, it is the home of the Valar, and three kindreds of Elves: the Vanyar, some of the Noldor, and some of the Teleri. Internal settingGeographyAman was a continent far to the west of Middle-earth across the great ocean Belegaer.  The island of Tol Eressëa lies just off its eastern shore.    At the end of the Second Age, Aman was removed from the surface of the Earth to another realm, and is no longer reachable by ordinary means of travel. 

Calaquendi<====>65284<====>Calaquendi In the fictional universe of J.  R.  R.  Tolkien, Calaquendi means in Quenya "Light-folk",  but was often translated "Elves of the Light".  This name has a long history. There existed two old elvish compounds in the Quenderin language, Primitive Quendian with *kwendī "Elves": *kala-kwendī and *mori-kwendī, meaning the "Light-folk" and the "Dark-folk".  These two words date from the time before the Sundering of the Elves, or rather to the time of the debate among them about the invitation by the Valar to migrate to Valinor. Both words were made by the party favourable to the Vala Oromë, and referred originally to Elves who desired the Light of Valinor versus Elves who did not wish to leave Middle-earth. 

Vanyar<====>65286<====>Vanyar    In the fictional universe, or legendarium, described in the works of J.  R.  R.  Tolkien, the Vanyar are the fairest and most noble of the High Elves.  They are the smallest of the three clans of the Eldar, and were the first to arrive in Aman.  According to legend, the clan was founded by Imin, the first Elf to awake at Cuiviénen, with his wife Iminyë and their twelve companions.  Ingwë was the Vanya Elf to travel with Oromë to Valinor, and became their king.  The Vanyar speak a dialect of Quenya called Vanyarin. 

Noldor<====>65288<====>Noldor In the works of J.  R.  R.  Tolkien, the Noldor (also spelled Ñoldor, meaning those with knowledge in Quenya) are High  Elves of the Second Clan who migrated to Valinor and lived in Eldamar.   The Noldor are called Golodhrim or Gódhellim in Sindarin, and Goldui by Teleri of Tol Eressëa.  The singular form of the Quenya noun is Noldo and the adjective is Noldorin.   They were the Second Clan of the Elves in both order and size, the other clans being the Vanyar and the Teleri.  Like the Teleri, they typically had grey eyes and dark hair (except for those who had Vanyarin blood, most prominently the members of the House of Finarfin). 

Finwë<====>65291<====>Finwë Finwë ( ) (Y. T.  ≥1050–Y. T.  1495; died aged c.  4293), sometimes surnamed Noldóran, is a fictional character from J.  R.  R.  Tolkien's legendarium.  He was the first High King of the Elven Noldor to lead his people on the journey from Middle-earth to Valinor in the blessed realm of Aman.  He was a great friend of Elu Thingol, the King of Doriath.  The story of Finwë and Míriel, his first wife, has been described as an important element of Tolkien's mythology.   The Silmarillion, prepared by Christopher Tolkien from his father's unpublished writings, only briefly mentions the tale, although sources suggest that Tolkien had intended to incorporate a fuller version. 

Fëanor<====>65293<====>Fëanor Fëanor ( ) is a fictional character from J.  R.  R.  Tolkien's legendarium who plays an important part in The Silmarillion.  He was the eldest son of Finwë, the High King of the Noldor, and his first wife Míriel Serindë.  Fëanor's mother, Míriel, died shortly after giving birth, having given all her strength and essence to him. Finwë remarried, and had two more sons, Fëanor's half-brothers Fingolfin and Finarfin, and two daughters, Findis and Írimë. Fëanor is best known as the creator of three gems, the Silmarils, which figure prominently in The Silmarillion and are mentioned briefly in The Lord of the Rings. 

Teleri<====>65296<====>Teleri  In the works of J.  R.  R.  Tolkien, the Teleri, Those who come last in Quenya (singular Teler) were the third of the Elf clans who came to Aman.   Those who came to Aman became known as the Falmari or "sea elves" and these are the Elves who are generally known as Teleri, though the term also includes their Middle-earth cousins  the Sindar, Laiquendi, and Nandor of Middle-earth. The third clan was the largest of the three houses of the Elves, and most of the Avari originally belonged to this clan. Ancient historyIn ancient times they named themselves Lindar, or "Singers", because they were known for their fair voices. 

Sindar<====>65299<====>Sindar    In the works of J.  R.  R.  Tolkien, the fictional Sindar (meaning Grey People, singular Sinda, although the latter term was not generally used by Tolkien) are Elves of Telerin descent.   They are also known as the Grey Elves.   Their language is Sindarin.  The King of Doriath, Elu Thingol (Elwë) was the King of the Sindar. Internal historyThe Sindar were happy in Middle-earth, but once the desire for the Sea was aroused in them, they could not be content until they sailed to Eldamar.  Although less learned and powerful than the Calaquendi and less interested in crafts than the Noldor, they were extremely gifted in music, and their voices were very fair. 

Nandor (Middle-earth)<====>65300<====>Nandor (Middle-earth) In the fictional world of J.  R.  R.  Tolkien, the Nandor (singular Nando) were Elves of the Teleri, the third clan of Elves. Internal historyWhen the marching Elves reached the Hithaeglir (Misty Mountains) some left the Great Journey under their leader Lenwë (Dan or Denweg in Nandorin).  These Elves turned south along the Great River (Anduin).  Nandor means in Quenya "those who turned back". Many years later a group of Nandor under Denethor, son of Lenwë, crossed the Ered Luin into Ossiriand, which was after named Lindon, or Land of the singers, after these elves. 

Neverwhere<====>65305<====>Neverwhere    Neverwhere is an urban fantasy television series by Neil Gaiman that first aired in 1996 on BBC Two.  The series is set in "London Below", a magical realm coexisting with the more familiar London, referred to as "London Above".  It was devised by Neil Gaiman and Lenny Henry, and directed by Dewi Humphreys.  Gaiman adapted the series into a novel, which was released in September 1996.  The series and book were partially inspired by Gene Wolfe's novel Free Live Free.    "In a letter from the author included in the study guide, Gaiman revealed that he got the idea for Neverwhere after reading, "Free, Live Free," a Gene Wolfe book set in Chicago. 

World War III<====>65307<====>World War III    World War III (WWIII or WW3) and the Third World War are names given to a hypothetical third worldwide large-scale military conflict subsequent to World War I and World War II.  The term has been in use since at least as early as 1941.  Some have applied it loosely to refer to limited or smaller conflicts such as the Cold War or the War on Terror, while others have operated under the assumption that such a conflict would surpass both prior World Wars in both the level of its widespread scope and of its overall destructive impact. 

Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction<====>65308<====>Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction  Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction is a subgenre of science fiction, science fantasy or horror in which the Earth's technological civilization is collapsing or has collapsed.  The apocalypse event may be climatic, such as runaway climate change; natural, such as an impact event; man-made, such as nuclear warfare or resource depletion; medical, such as a Pandemic, whether natural or man-made; Eschatological such as the Last Judgement, Second Coming or Ragnarök; or imaginative, such as a zombie apocalypse, cybernetic revolt, technological singularity, dysgenics, or alien invasion.  The story may involve attempts to prevent an apocalypse event, deal with the impact and consequences of the event itself, or it may be post-apocalyptic, set after the event. 

Support vector machine<====>65309<====>Support vector machine  In machine learning, support vector machines (SVMs, also support vector networks ) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis.   Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one or the other of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting).  An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. 

Arawak<====>65313<====>Arawak   The Arawak are a group of indigenous peoples of South America and of the Caribbean.  Specifically, the term Arawak has been applied at various times to the Lokono of South America and the Taíno, who historically lived in the Greater Antilles and northern Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean, all of whom spoke related Arawakan languages. NameThe term Arawak originally applied specifically to the South American group who self-identified as Arawak, Arhuaco or Lokono.  Their language, the Arawak language, gives its name to the Arawakan language family.  Arawakan speakers in the Caribbean were also historically known as the Taíno, a term meaning good or noble that some islanders used to distinguish their group from the neighboring Island Caribs. 

Canna (plant)<====>65316<====>Canna (plant) DISPLAYTITLE Canna (or canna lily, although not a true lily) is a genus of 10 species    of flowering plants.    The Cannaceae of the World, H.  Maas-van der Kamer & P. J. M.  Maas, BLUMEA 53: 247-318  The closest living relations to cannas are the other plant families of the order Zingiberales, that is the Zingiberaceae (gingers), Musaceae (bananas), Marantaceae, Heliconiaceae, Strelitziaceae, etc.  Canna is the only genus in the family Cannaceae.  The APG II system of 2003   assigns it to the clade commelinids, in the monocots. 

Edward Hopper<====>65319<====>Edward Hopper Edward Hopper (July 22, 1882 – May 15, 1967) was a prominent American realist painter and printmaker.  While he was most popularly known for his oil paintings, he was equally proficient as a watercolorist and printmaker in etching.  Both in his urban and rural scenes, his spare and finely calculated renderings reflected his personal vision of modern American life.  BiographyEarly lifeHopper was born in 1882 in Upper Nyack, New York, a yacht-building center on the Hudson River north of New York City.   He was one of two children of a comfortably well-to-do family. 

Infant formula<====>65330<====>Infant formula Infant formula is a manufactured food designed and marketed for feeding to babies and infants under 12 months of age, usually prepared for bottle-feeding or cup-feeding from powder (mixed with water) or liquid (with or without additional water).  The U. S.

Peter III of Aragon<====>65621<====>Peter III of Aragon  Peter the Great ( ,  ; 1239 – 11 November 1285)  was the King of Aragon (as Peter III) of Valencia (as Peter I), and Count of Barcelona (as Peter II) from 1276 to his death, (this union of kingdoms was called the Crown of Aragon).  At the invitation of some rebels, he conquered Sicily and became its king in 1282, pressing the claim of his wife, Constance of Hohenstaufen, uniting the kingdom to the crown.  He was one of the greatest of medieval Aragonese monarchs. Youth and successionPeter was the eldest son of James I of Aragon and his second wife Violant of Hungary. 

Clinical chemistry<====>65622<====>Clinical chemistry  Clinical chemistry (also known as chemical pathology, clinical biochemistry or medical biochemistry) is the area of chemistry that is generally  concerned with analysis of bodily fluids for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.  It is an applied form of biochemistry (not to be confused with medicinal chemistry, which involves basic research for drug development). The discipline originated in the late 19th century with the use of simple chemical reaction tests for various components of blood and urine.  In the many decades since, other techniques have been applied as science and technology have advanced, including the use and measurement of enzyme activities, spectrophotometry, electrophoresis, and immunoassay. 

Creatinine<====>65623<====>Creatinine   Creatinine (  or  ; from  ) is a breakdown product of creatine phosphate in muscle, and is usually produced at a fairly constant rate by the body (depending on muscle mass). Biological relevanceSerum creatinine (a blood measurement) is an important indicator of renal health because it is an easily measured byproduct of muscle metabolism that is excreted unchanged by the kidneys.  Creatinine itself is produced  via a biological system involving creatine, phosphocreatine (also known as creatine phosphate), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP, the body's immediate energy supply). Creatine is synthesized primarily in the liver from the methylation of glycocyamine (guanidino acetate, synthesized in the kidney from the amino acids arginine and glycine) by S-adenosyl methionine. 

Peterloo Massacre<====>65626<====>Peterloo Massacre    The Peterloo Massacre occurred at St Peter's Field, Manchester, England, on 16 August 1819, when cavalry charged into a crowd of 60,000–80,000 who had gathered to demand the reform of parliamentary representation. The end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 had resulted in periods of famine and chronic unemployment, exacerbated by the introduction of the first of the Corn Laws.  By the beginning of 1819, the pressure generated by poor economic conditions, coupled with the relative lack of suffrage in Northern England, had enhanced the appeal of political radicalism.  In response, the Manchester Patriotic Union, a group agitating for parliamentary reform, organised a demonstration to be addressed by the well-known radical orator Henry Hunt. 

Völuspá<====>65627<====>Völuspá  Völuspá (Old Norse Vǫluspá or Vǫluspǫ́, Prophecy of the Völva (Seeress); reconstructed Old Norse  , Modern Icelandic  ) is the first and best known poem of the Poetic Edda.  It tells the story of the creation of the world and its coming end, related to the audience by a völva addressing Odin.   It is one of the most important primary sources for the study of Norse mythology.  Henry Adam Bellows proposed a 10th-century dating and authorship by a pagan Icelander with knowledge of Christianity.  He also assumes the early hearers would have been very familiar with the "story" of the poem and not in need of an explanation. 

Chirp<====>65635<====>Chirp  A chirp is a signal in which the frequency increases (up-chirp) or decreases (down-chirp) with time.  In some sources, the term chirp is used interchangeably with sweep signal.    It is commonly used in sonar and radar, but has other applications, such as in spread-spectrum communications.  In spread-spectrum usage, surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices such as reflective array compressors (RACs) are often used to generate and demodulate the chirped signals.  In optics, ultrashort laser pulses also exhibit chirp, which, in optical transmission systems, interacts with the dispersion properties of the materials, increasing or decreasing total pulse dispersion as the signal propagates. 

Metrology<====>65637<====>Metrology  Metrology, as defined by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), is "the science of measurement, embracing both experimental and theoretical determinations at any level of uncertainty in any field of science and technology".It establishes a common understanding of units, crucial in linking human activities.   Modern metrology has its roots in the French Revolution's political motivation to standardise units in France, when a length standard taken from a natural source was proposed.  This led to the creation of the decimal-based metric system in 1795, establishing a set of standards for other types of measurements. 

History of South Africa<====>65638<====>History of South Africa  The first humans are believed to have inhabited South Africa more than 100,000 years ago.  The historical record of this ethnically diverse country is generally divided into five distinct periods: the pre-colonial era, the colonial era, the post-colonial and apartheid eras, and the post-apartheid era.  Much of this history, particularly of the colonial and post-colonial eras, is characterised by clashes of culture, violent territorial disputes between European settlers and indigenous people, dispossession and repression, and other racial and political tensions.   The discoveries of diamonds and gold in the nineteenth century had a profound effect on the fortunes of the region, propelling it onto the world stage and introducing a shift away from an exclusively agrarian-based economy towards industrialisation and the development of urban infrastructure. 

Geography of South Africa<====>65639<====>Geography of South Africa    South Africa occupies the southern tip of Africa, its coastline stretching more than   from the desert border with Namibia on the Atlantic (western) coast southwards around the tip of Africa and then northeast to the border with Mozambique on the Indian Ocean.  The low-lying coastal zone is narrow for much of that distance, soon giving way to a mountainous escarpment (Great Escarpment) that separates the coast from the high inland plateau.  In some places, notably the province of KwaZulu-Natal in the east, a greater distance separates the coast from the escarpment. 

Demographics of South Africa<====>65643<====>Demographics of South Africa   The demographics of South Africa encompasses about 56  million people of diverse origins, cultures, languages, and religions.  The last census was held in 2011 and the next will be taken anywhere from 2016–2021. In 2011, Statistics South Africa counted 2. 1 million foreigners in total.   However, numerous reports suggest that that is a vast underestimation.  The real figure may in fact be as high as five million,  including some three million Zimbabweans.  PopulationHistorical population U. N.  population projections: 2010 to 2050 Age and population estimates: 1950 to 2015According to the 2010 revision of the United Nations Secretariat's World Population Prospects, South Africa's total population was 50,133,000 in 2010, compared to only 13,683,000 in 1950.

A Knight's Tale<====>65669<====>A Knight's Tale  A Knight's Tale is a 2001 American medieval adventure-comedy film written, produced, and directed by Brian Helgeland.  The film stars Heath Ledger, Shannyn Sossamon, Mark Addy, Alan Tudyk, Rufus Sewell, Paul Bettany as Geoffrey Chaucer, and James Purefoy as Sir Thomas Colville/Edward, the Black Prince.

Spinning wheel<====>65672<====>Spinning wheel A spinning wheel is a device for spinning thread or yarn from natural or synthetic fibres.  Spinning wheels were first used in India, between 500 and 1000 C. E.   Spinning machinery, such as the spinning jenny and spinning frame, displaced the spinning wheel during the Industrial Revolution. HistoryThe Spinning Wheel was invented in India, between 500 and 1000 C. E.   The earliest clear illustrations of the spinning wheel come from Baghdad (drawn in 1234),  China (c.  1270) and Europe (c.  1280), and there is evidence that spinning wheels had already come into use in both China   and the Islamic world during the eleventh century.

Anton Webern<====>65676<====>Anton WebernAnton Friedrich Wilhelm (von) Webern ( ; 3 December 1883 15 September 1945) was an Austrian composer and conductor.  Along with his mentor Arnold Schoenberg and his colleague Alban Berg, Webern was at the core among those within the circle of the Second Viennese School, including Ernst Krenek and Theodor W.  Adorno.  As an exponent of atonality and twelve-tone technique, Webern exerted influence on contemporaries Luigi Dallapiccola, Křenek, and even Schoenberg himself.  As a tutor, Webern guided and variously influenced Arnold Elston, Frederick Dorian (Friederich Deutsch), Matty Niël, Fré Focke, Karl Amadeus Hartmann, Philipp Herschkowitz, René Leibowitz, Humphrey Searle, Leopold Spinner, and Stefan Wolpe. 

Sumerian language<====>65677<====>Sumerian language Sumerian (  "native tongue") is the language of ancient Sumer and a language isolate that was spoken in southern Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq).  During the 3rd millennium BC, an intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians and the Akkadians, which included widespread  .   The influence of Sumerian and the East Semitic language Akkadian on each other is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a substantial scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.   This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium BC as a Sprachbund. 

Car Wars<====>65679<====>Car Wars  Car Wars is a vehicle combat simulation game developed by Steve Jackson Games.  It was first published in 1980.   Players control armed vehicles in a post-apocalyptic future. Game playIn Car Wars, players assume control of one or more cars or other powered vehicle, from motorcycles to semi trucks.Optional rules include piloting helicopters, ultralights, balloons, boats, submarines and tanks.  The vehicles are typically outfitted with weapons (such as missiles and machine guns), souped-up components (like heavy-duty fire-proof wheels, and nitro injectors), and defensive elements (armor plating and radar tracking systems). 

Polytonality<====>65681<====>PolytonalityPolytonality (also polyharmony  ) is the musical use of more than one key simultaneously.  Bitonality is the use of only two different keys at the same time.  Polyvalence is the use of more than one harmonic function, from the same key, at the same time  . Some examples of bitonality superimpose fully harmonized sections of music in different keys. HistoryIn traditional musicLithuanian traditional singing style sutartines is based on polytonality.  A typical sutartines song is based on a six-bar melody, where the first three bars contains melody based on the notes of the triad of a major key (for example, in G major), and the next three bars is based on another key, always a major second higher or lower (for example, in A major). 

Drive-by shooting<====>65683<====>Drive-by shooting   A drive-by shooting is a type of assault that typically involves the perpetrator firing a weapon from within a motor vehicle and then fleeing.Such shootings are often associated with gang violence in urban areas of the United States but also occur in other contexts and other countries.  The tactic is also known in the media as simply a "drive-by".The primary motivations for a gang-involved drive-by include intimidation, terrorization, and assassination of rival street gang members.Drive-by shootings allow the perpetrator(s) to quickly strike their target and then flee the scene before law enforcement is able to respond. 

Mini<====>65684<====>Mini   The Mini is a small economy car produced by the English-based British Motor Corporation (BMC) and its successors from 1959 until 2000.  The original is considered an icon of 1960s British popular culture.  Its space-saving transverse engine front-wheel drive layout – allowing 80 percent of the area of the car's floorpan to be used for passengers and luggage – influenced a generation of car makers.   In 1999 the Mini was voted the second most influential car of the 20th century, behind the Ford Model T, and ahead of the Citroën DS and Volkswagen Beetle. 

Volkswagen Beetle<====>65685<====>Volkswagen Beetle   The Volkswagen Beetle – officially the Volkswagen Type 1, informally in Germany the Käfer (German, "beetle") and in parts of the English-speaking world the Bug – is a two-door, five-passenger  , rear-engine economy car that was manufactured and marketed by German automaker Volkswagen (VW) from 1938 until 2003.  The need for a people's car ("Volkswagen" in German), its concept and its functional objectives, was formulated by the leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler, who wanted a cheap, simple car to be mass-produced for his country's new road network.  Lead engineer Ferdinand Porsche and his team took until 1938 to finalise the design. 

Science-fiction fanzine<====>65686<====>Science-fiction fanzineA science-fiction fanzine is an amateur or semi-professional magazine published by members of science-fiction fandom, from the 1930s to the present day.  They were one of the earliest forms of fanzine, within one of which the term "fanzine" was coined, and at one time constituted the primary type of science-fictional fannish activity ("fanac"). Origins and historyThe first science-fiction fanzine, The Comet, was published in 1930 by the Science Correspondence Club in Chicago.  The term "fanzine" was coined  in October 1940 by Russ Chauvenet.  "Fanzines" were distinguished from "prozines", that is, all professional magazines.  Prior to that, the fan publications were known as "fanmags" or "letterzines. 

Óscar Romero<====>65689<====>Óscar Romero   Óscar Arnulfo Romero y Galdámez (15 August 1917 – 24 March 1980) was a prelate of the Catholic Church in El Salvador, who served as the fourth Archbishop of San Salvador.  He spoke out against poverty, social injustice, assassinations, and torture.  In 1980, Romero was assassinated while offering Mass in the chapel of the Hospital of Divine Providence. Pope Francis stated during Romero's beatification that "His ministry was distinguished by his particular attention to the most poor and marginalized. "  Hailed as a hero by supporters of liberation theology inspired by his work, Romero, according to his biographer, "was not interested in liberation theology" but faithfully adhered to Catholic teachings on liberation and a preferential option for the poor,  desiring a social revolution based on interior reform. 

Operational definition<====>65692<====>Operational definition An operational definition is the articulation of operationalization used in defining the terms of a process (or set of validation tests) needed to determine the nature of an item or phenomenon (e. g.  a variable, term, or object) and its properties such as duration, quantity, extension in space, chemical composition, etc.    Since the degree of operationalization can vary itself, it can result in a more or less operational definition.   The procedures included in definitions should be repeatable by anyone or at least by peers. An example of operational definition of the term weight of an object, operationalized to a degree, would be the following: "weight is the numbers that appear when that object is placed on a weighing scale". 

Hancock, Michigan<====>65693<====>Hancock, Michigan   Hancock is a city in Houghton County, Michigan, United States and is located on Copper Island, which is part of the Keweenaw Peninsula, on the Keweenaw Waterway directly opposite Houghton, Michigan.

Mel scale<====>65698<====>Mel scaleThe mel scale, named by Stevens, Volkmann, and Newman in 1937,    is a perceptual scale of pitches judged by listeners to be equal in distance from one another.  The reference point between this scale and normal frequency measurement is defined by assigning a perceptual pitch of 1000 mels to a 1000 Hz tone, 40 dB above the listener's threshold.  Above about 500 Hz, increasingly large intervals are judged by listeners to produce equal pitch increments.  As a result, four octaves on the hertz scale above 500 Hz are judged to comprise about two octaves on the mel scale. 

Stanley Smith Stevens<====>65704<====>Stanley Smith Stevens  Stanley Smith Stevens (November 4, 1906 – January 18, 1973)    was an American psychologist who founded Harvard's Psycho-Acoustic Laboratory, studying psychoacoustics,  and he is credited with the introduction of Stevens's power law.  Stevens authored a milestone textbook, the 1400+ page "Handbook of Experimental Psychology" (1951).  He was also one of the founding organizers of the Psychonomic Society.   In 1946 he introduced a theory of levels of measurement widely used by scientists but criticized by statisticians.  In addition, Stevens played a key role in the development of the use of operational definitions in psychology. 

Aerobatics<====>65707<====>Aerobatics Aerobatics (a portmanteau of aerial-acrobatics) is the practice of flying maneuvers involving aircraft attitudes that are not used in normal flight. Aerobatics are performed in airplanes and gliders for training, recreation, entertainment, and sport.  Additionally, some helicopters, such as the MBB Bo 105, are capable of limited aerobatic maneuvers.An example of a fully aerobatic helicopter, capable of performing loops and rolls, is the Westland Lynx. Most aerobatic maneuvers involve rotation of the aircraft about its longitudinal (roll) axis or lateral (pitch) axis.  Other maneuvers, such as a spin, displace the aircraft about its vertical (yaw) axis. 

Düsseldorf<====>65711<====>Düsseldorf   Düsseldorf ( , Low Franconian, Ripuarian: Düsseldörp  ) is the capital city of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia and the seventh most populous city in Germany.   Düsseldorf is an international business and financial centre, renowned for its fashion and trade fairs.The city is headquarters to one Fortune Global 500 and two DAX companies.  Messe Düsseldorf organises nearly one fifth of premier trade shows.  Düsseldorf is known for its academy of fine arts (Joseph Beuys, Emanuel Leutze, August Macke, Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, and Andreas Gursky), its pioneering influence on electronic/experimental music (Kraftwerk) and its Japanese community. 

Battle of Nanking<====>65712<====>Battle of NankingThe Battle of Nanking (or Nanjing) was fought in early December 1937 during the Second Sino-Japanese War between the Chinese National Revolutionary Army and the Imperial Japanese Army for control of Nanking (Nanjing), the capital of the Republic of China. Following the outbreak of war between Japan and China in July 1937, the Japanese government at first attempted to contain the fighting and sought a negotiated settlement to the war.  However, after victory in the Battle of Shanghai expansionists prevailed within the Japanese military and on December 1 a campaign to capture Nanking was officially authorized. 

Temple Mount<====>65719<====>Temple Mount    The Temple Mount ( , Har HaBáyit, "Mount of the House [of God, i. e.  the Temple]"), known to Muslims as the Haram esh-Sharif ( , al-Ḥaram al-Šarīf, "the Noble Sanctuary", or  , al-Ḥaram al-Qudsī al-Šarīf, "the Noble Sanctuary of Jerusalem") is a hill located in the Old City of Jerusalem that for thousands of years has been venerated as a holy site, by Jews, Christians, and Muslims alike.  The present site is dominated by three monumental structures from the early Umayyad period: the al-Aqsa Mosque, the Dome of the Rock and the Dome of the Chain, as well as four minarets. 

Vibrato<====>65723<====>Vibrato   Vibrato (Italian, from past participle of " ", to vibrate) is a musical effect consisting of a regular, pulsating change of pitch.  It is used to add expression to vocal and instrumental music.  Vibrato is typically characterised in terms of two factors: the amount of pitch variation ("extent of vibrato") and the speed with which the pitch is varied ("rate of vibrato").    In singing it can occur spontaneously through variations in the larynx.   The vibrato of a string instrument and wind instrument is an imitation of that vocal function. Vibrato and tremoloThe terms vibrato and tremolo are sometimes incorrectly used interchangeably, although (in the classical world) they are properly defined as separate effects with vibrato defined as a periodic variation in the pitch (frequency) of a musical note, and tremolo as a fast repetition of the same note (usually a semiquaver) in order to produce the audible effect of a longer note, especially on instruments which do not have the ability of producing long sustained notes, such as the guitar. 

Dome of the Rock<====>65724<====>Dome of the Rock    The Dome of the Rock (  Qubbat al-Sakhrah,   Kippat ha-Sela) is an Islamic shrine located on the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem. It was initially completed in 691 CE at the order of Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik during the Second Fitna, built on the site of the Roman temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, which had in turn been built on the site of the Second Jewish Temple, destroyed during the Roman Siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE. The original dome collapsed in 1015 and was rebuilt in 1022–23. 

Lost Gardens of Heligan<====>65726<====>Lost Gardens of Heligan  The Lost Gardens of Heligan ( , meaning "willow tree garden"), near Mevagissey in Cornwall, are one of the most popular botanical gardens in the UK.  The gardens are typical of the 19th century Gardenesque style with areas of different character and in different design styles. The gardens were created by members of the Cornish Tremayne family from the mid-18th century to the beginning of the 20th century, and still form part of the family's Heligan estate.  The gardens were neglected after the First World War and restored only in the 1990s, a restoration that was the subject of several popular television programmes and books. 

Miskatonic University<====>65728<====>Miskatonic University Miskatonic University is a fictional university located in Arkham, a fictitious town in Essex County, Massachusetts.  It is named after the Miskatonic River (also fictional).  After first appearing in H.  P.  Lovecraft's 1922 story "Herbert West–Reanimator", the school appeared in numerous  Cthulhu Mythos stories by Lovecraft and other writers.  The story "The Dunwich Horror" implies that Miskatonic University is a highly prestigious university, on par with Harvard University, and that Harvard and Miskatonic are the two most popular schools for the children of the Massachusetts “Old Gentry”.  The university also appears in role-playing games and board games based on the mythos. 

Arkham<====>65730<====>Arkham  Arkham ( ) is a fictional town situated in Massachusetts.  It is a dark city and an integral part of the Lovecraft Country setting created by H.  P.  Lovecraft, and it is featured in many of his stories and those of other Cthulhu Mythos writers. Arkham House, a publishing company started by two of Lovecraft's correspondents, August Derleth and Donald Wandrei, takes its name from this city as a tribute.  In Lovecraft's stories   Arkham is the home of Miskatonic University, which figures prominently in many of Lovecraft's works.  The institution finances the expeditions in both At the Mountains of Madness (1936) and The Shadow Out of Time (1936). 

Korybantes<====>65731<====>Korybantes According to the Greek mythology, the Korybantes ( ;  ) were the armed and crested dancers who worshipped the Phrygian goddess Cybele with drumming and dancing.  They are also called the Kurbantes in Phrygia.  The conventional English equivalent is "Corybants".  The Korybantes were the offspring of Thalia and Apollo. EtymologyThe name Korybantes is of uncertain etymology.  Edzard Johan Furnée and R.  S.  P.  Beekes have suggested a Pre-Greek origin.   Others refer the name to *κορυβή (korybé), the Macedonian version of κορυφή (koryphé) "crown, top, mountain peak", explaining their association with mountains, particularly Olympus.

Solanum<====>65733<====>Solanum   Solanum is a large and diverse genus of flowering plants, which include two food crops of high economic importance, the potato and the tomato.  It also contains the nightshades and horse nettles, as well as numerous plants cultivated for their ornamental flowers and fruit. Solanum species show a wide range of growing habits, such as annual and perennials, vines, subshrubs, shrubs, and small trees.  Many formerly independent genera like Lycopersicon (the tomatoes) and Cyphomandra are now included in Solanum as subgenera or sections.  Thus, the genus today contains roughly 1,500–2,000 species. NameThe generic name was first used by Pliny the Elder (23–79) for a plant also known as strychnos, most likely S. 

Bushido<====>65734<====>Bushido    is a Japanese collective term for the many codes of honour and ideals that dictated the samurai way of life, loosely analogous to the concept of chivalry in Europe.  The "way" originates from the samurai moral values, most commonly stressing some combination of sincerity, frugality, loyalty, martial arts mastery, and honour until death.  Born from Neo-Confucianism during times of peace in the Edo period (1600–1878) and following Confucian texts, while also being influenced by Shinto and Zen Buddhism, allowing the violent existence of the samurai to be tempered by wisdom and serenity.  Bushidō developed between the 16th and 20th centuries, debated by pundits who believed they were building on a legacy dating back to the 10th century, although some scholars have noted that the term bushidō itself is "rarely attested in pre-modern literature". 

The Rape of Nanking (book)<====>65735<====>The Rape of Nanking (book)   The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II is a bestselling 1997 non-fiction book written by Iris Chang about the 1937–1938 Nanking Massacre, the massacre and atrocities committed by the Imperial Japanese Army after it captured Nanjing, then capital of China, during the Second Sino-Japanese War.  It describes the events leading up to the Nanking Massacre and the atrocities that were committed.  The book presents the view that the Japanese government has not done enough to redress the atrocities.  It is one of the first major English-language books to introduce the Nanking Massacre to Western and Eastern readers alike, and has been translated into several languages. 

Georges Clemenceau<====>65738<====>Georges Clemenceau  Georges Benjamin Clemenceau  ( ;  28 September 1841 – 24 November 1929) was a French politician, physician, and journalist who was Prime Minister of France during the First World War.  A leader of the Radical Party, he played a central role in the politics of the French Third Republic. Clemenceau was first Prime Minister from 1906 to 1909, and then again from 1917 to 1920.  In favour of a total victory over the German Empire, he militated for the restitution of Alsace-Lorraine to France.  He was one of the principal architects of the Treaty of Versailles at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. 

Aratrum<====>65741<====>Aratrum Aratrum is the Latin word for ard, and arotron (ἄροτρον) is the Greek word.  The Greeks appear to have had several kinds of ard from the records.  Hesiod advised the farmer to always have two ards handy, so that if one broke the other could replace it.  These ards should be of two kinds.  The first was the body- or crook-ard, called autoguos (αυτογυος, "self-limbed"), in which the stilt (Gk echetle; Lat stiva) was of the same piece of timber as the ard-head (Gk elyma; Lat dentale) and the draft-beam (Gk histoboeus; Lat buris).  The second was the sole-ard, called pekton (πηκτον, "fixed"), because in it three parts (stilt + sole (Gk gyes) + beam), which were of three kinds of timber, were adjusted to one another and fastened together by nails. 

Freetekno<====>65743<====>Freetekno    Freetekno is the name of a cultural movement that is present in Europe, Australia and North America.  Freetekno sound systems or tribes form in loose collectives, frequently with anarchist philosophies.  These sound systems join together to hold parties wherever a viable space can be found – typical locations include warehouses (also known as squat parties), fields, abandoned buildings or forests.  Because freetekno parties are usually held illegally this sometimes leads to clashes with the police, as was the case at both the 2004 and 2005 Czechtek festivals and many other, smaller parties around the world at different times. 

Praetor<====>65747<====>Praetor  Praetor ( , also spelled prætor) was a title granted by the government of Ancient Rome to men acting in one of two official capacities: the commander of an army (in the field or, less often, before the army had been mustered); or, an elected magistratus (magistrate), assigned various duties (which varied at different periods in Rome's history).  The functions of the magistracy, the praetura (praetorship), are described by the adjective:  the praetoria potestas (praetorian power), the praetorium imperium (praetorian authority), and the praetorium ius (praetorian law), the legal precedents established by the praetores (praetors).  Praetorium, as a substantive, denoted the location from which the praetor exercised his authority, either the headquarters of his castra, the courthouse (tribunal) of his judiciary, or the city hall of his provincial governorship. 

Avonlea (Anne of Green Gables)<====>65748<====>Avonlea (Anne of Green Gables)  Avonlea ( ;ah-von-LEE) is a fictional community located on Prince Edward Island, Canada, and is the setting of Lucy Maud Montgomery's novel Anne of Green Gables, following the adventures of Anne Shirley, as well as its sequels, and the television series Road to Avonlea. Montgomery drew much of her inspiration for Avonlea from her childhood experiences in the late 19th century farming communities surrounding Cavendish, New Glasgow, New London, Hunter River, and Park Corner. In Montgomery's works, Avonlea is located on the northern shore of Prince Edward Island on a small peninsula.  Its primary industries are farming and lobster fishing. 

Rational expectations<====>65753<====>Rational expectations   In economics, "rational expectations" are model-consistent expectations, in that agents inside the model are assumed to "know the model" and on average take the model's predictions as valid.   Rational expectations ensure internal consistency in models involving uncertainty.  To obtain consistency within a model, the predictions of future values of economically relevant variables from the model are assumed to be the same as that of the decision-makers in the model, given their information set, the nature of the random processes involved, and model structure.  The rational expectations assumption is used especially in many contemporary macroeconomic models. 

Yeti<====>65755<====>Yeti    In the folklore of Nepal, the Yeti ( )  or Abominable Snowman (Nepali: हिममानव himamānav, lit.  "snow man") is an ape-like entity, taller than an average human, that is said to inhabit the Himalayan region of Nepal, Bhutan, and Tibet.  The names Yeti and Meh-Teh are commonly used by the people indigenous to the region, and are part of their history and mythology.  Stories of the Yeti first emerged as a facet of Western popular culture in the 19th century. The scientific community has generally regarded the Yeti as a legend, given the lack of evidence of its existence. 

Western (genre)<====>65758<====>Western (genre)  The Western is a genre of various arts which tell stories set primarily in the later half of the 19th century in the American Old West, often centering on the life of a nomadic cowboy or gunfighter  armed with a revolver and a rifle who rides a horse.  Cowboys and gunslingers typically wear Stetson hats, bandannas, spurs, cowboy boots and buckskins.  Other characters include Native Americans, bandits, lawmen, bounty hunters, outlaws, soldiers (especially mounted cavalry), settlers, both farmers and ranchers, and townsfolk. Westerns often stress the harshness of the wilderness and frequently set the action in an arid, desolate landscape of deserts and mountains. 

Al-Aqsa Mosque<====>65759<====>Al-Aqsa MosqueAl-Aqsa Mosque (  Al-Masjid al-‘Aqṣā,  , "the Farthest Mosque"), also known as Al-Aqsa and Bayt al-Maqdis, is the third holiest site in Islam and is located in the Old City of Jerusalem.  Whilst the entire site on which the silver-domed mosque sits, along with the Dome of the Rock, seventeen gates, and four minarets, was itself historically known as the Al-Aqsa Mosque, today a narrower definition prevails,According to historian Oleg Grabar, "It is only at a relatively late date that the Muslim holy space in Jerusalem came to be referred to as al-haram al-sharif (literally, the Noble Sacred Precinct or Restricted Enclosure, often translated as the Noble Sanctuary and usually simply referred to as the Haram). 

List of narrative techniques<====>65761<====>List of narrative techniquesA narrative technique (also known more narrowly for literary fictional narratives as a literary technique, literary device, or fictional device) is any of several specific methods the creator of a narrative uses to convey what they want   —in other words, a strategy used in the making of a narrative to relay information to the audience and, particularly, to "develop" the narrative, usually in order to make it more complete, complicated, or interesting.  Literary techniques are distinguished from literary elements, which exist inherently in works of writing. SettingName  Definition Example Setting  The setting is both the time and geographic location within a narrative or within a work of fiction. 

Duncan Forbes (linguist)<====>65765<====>Duncan Forbes (linguist)Duncan Forbes (28 April 1798 – 17 August 1868) was a Scottish linguist. He was born at Kinnaird  , Perthshire and brought up by his grandfather from the age of three after his parents and younger brother emigrated to the United States.  Illiterate until 13, he showed no early signs of linguistic ability, but despite this late start, at age 17 he was appointed schoolmaster of the village of Stralock. Shortly after this he attended Kirkmichael school followed by Perth Grammar School and the University of St.  Andrews, gaining a master's degree from the latter. 

Theatre technique<====>65771<====>Theatre technique Theatre techniques are procedures that facilitate a successful presentation of a play.  They also include any practices that advance and enhance the understanding the audience brings to the action and the acting by the caston stage. The playwright's craftTheatre technique is part of the playwright's creative writing of drama, as a kind of mimesis rather than mere illusion or imitation of life, in that the playwright is able to present a reality to the audience that is different, yet recognisable to that which they usually identify with in their everyday lives.   Another aspect of this is that of creating the kind of dialogue that makes the playwright's characters come alive and allows for their development in the course of his dramatization. 

Metcalfe's law<====>65776<====>Metcalfe's lawMetcalfe's law states that the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected usersof the system (n 2 ).  First formulated in this form by George Gilder in 1993,  and attributed to Robert Metcalfe in regard to Ethernet, Metcalfe's law was originally presented, c.  1980, not in terms of users, but rather of "compatible communicating devices" (for example, fax machines, telephones, etc. ).   Only later with the globalization of the Internet did this law carry over to users and networks as its original intent was to describe Ethernet purchases and connections. 

Buzz Aldrin<====>65777<====>Buzz Aldrin  Buzz Aldrin (born Edwin Eugene Aldrin Jr. ; January 20, 1930) is an American engineer and former astronaut.  As the Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 11, he was one of the first two humans to land on the Moon, and the second person to walk on it.  He set foot on the Moon at 03:15:16 on July 21, 1969 (UTC), following mission commander Neil Armstrong.  He is a former U. S.  Air Force officer with the Command Pilot rating.  He also went into orbit on the Gemini 12 mission, finally achieving the goals for EVA (space-walk work) that paved the way to the Moon and success for the Gemini program; he spent over five hours on EVA on that mission. 

Vladimir Komarov<====>65780<====>Vladimir Komarov   Vladimir Mikhaylovich Komarov ( ; 16 March 1927 24 April 1967) was a Soviet test pilot, aerospace engineer and cosmonaut.  In October 1964, he commanded Voskhod 1, the first spaceflight to carry more than one crew member.  He became the first cosmonaut to fly in space twice when he was selected as the solo pilot of Soyuz 1, the first manned test flight of a new spacecraft.  A parachute failure caused his Soyuz capsule to crash into the ground after re-entry on 24 April 1967, making him the first human to die in a space flight.

It comprises an area of   and the total length of the island is  , making it the world's tenth largest island and Canada's third largest island.  The Arctic Cordillera mountain system covers much of Ellesmere Island, making it the most mountainous in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. 

Teichoscopy<====>65782<====>TeichoscopyTeichoscopy or teichoscopia,  meaning "viewing from the walls," is a recurring narrative strategy in ancient Greek literature.  One famous instance of teichoscopy occurs in Homer's Iliad, Book 3, lines 121-244. The passage begins with Helen approached in her chamber by Iris, disguised as her sister-in-law Laodice, the daughter of Priam.  Helen is then led to the walls of the Skaian gates, where she is summoned by Priam, who asks her to point out the Achaean heroes she sees on the Trojan plain.  Below her, the two armies are preparing for the duel between Menelaus and Paris. 

Central Baseball League<====>65783<====>Central Baseball League   The Central Baseball League, formerly the Texas–Louisiana League, was a minor league whose member teams were independent of any Major League Baseball affiliations.  In 1991, potential owners, Dallas businessman Byron Pierce and U.  S.  Congressman John Bryant, became frustrated that the Texas League had no plans to expand into other Texas locations, and formed The Texas–Louisiana League.  The league began play in 1994.  After further expansion into Missouri and Mississippi, the Texas–Louisiana League changed its name to the Central Baseball League.  In 12 seasons, the league produced 10 different champions; Alexandria and Edinburg were the only teams to win a title twice. 

Alexandria Aces<====>65784<====>Alexandria Aces The Alexandria Aces were a baseball team based in Alexandria, Louisiana.  The last version of the Aces played in the United League in 2013.  The Aces have played their home games at historic Bringhurst Field, which was built in 1933 for the original Alexandria Aces. HistoryThat team started in 1934 as a member of the old Evangeline League and ceased operations with the league in 1942 due to World War II.  This early era was highlighted by the presence of Hal Newhouser and Virgil Trucks, future Detroit Tigers' stars who headed the pitching staff of the 1939 Aces. 

Tremolo<====>65785<====>Tremolo  In music, tremolo ( ), or tremolando ( ), is a trembling effect.  There are two types of tremolo. The first is a rapid reiteration:of a single note, particularly used on bowed string instruments, by rapidly moving the bow back and forth; plucked strings such as on a harp, where it is called   ( ) or "whispering"; and tremolo picking, in which a single note is repeated extremely rapidly with a plectrum (or "pick") on traditionally plucked string instruments such as guitar, mandolin, etc. between two notes or chords in alternation, an imitation (not to be confused with a trill) of the preceding that is more common on keyboard instruments. 

Anti-Arabism<====>65786<====>Anti-Arabism Anti-Arabism, Anti-Arab sentiment or Arabophobia is opposition to, or dislike, fear, hatred, and advocacy of genocide of Arab people. Historically, anti-Arab prejudice has been suggested by such events as the reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula, the condemnation of Arabs in Spain by the Spanish Inquisition, the Zanzibar Revolution in 1964, and the 2005 Cronulla riots in Australia.  In the current era, racial prejudice against Arabs is apparent in many countries including Iran, Poland, France, Australia, Israel, and the United States (including Hollywood).  Various advocacy organizations have been formed to protect the civil rights of Arab citizens in the United States, such as the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). 

Admiral<====>65787<====>AdmiralAdmiral is one of the highest naval ranks in some navies, and in many navies is the highest rank.   It is usually abbreviated to "Adm" or "ADM".   The rank is generally thought to have originated in Sicily from a conflation of  , amīr al-baḥr, "commander of the sea", with Latin admirabilis    ("admirable") or admiratus ("admired", although alternative etymologies derive the word directly from Latin, or from the Turkish military and naval rank miralay.  The French version - "Amiral" without the additional "d" - tends to add evidence for the Arab origin. 

Shenzhou (spacecraft)<====>65791<====>Shenzhou (spacecraft)  Shenzhou (   or  ;  ) is a spacecraft developed and operated by China using old Soyuz technology to support its manned spaceflight program.  The name is variously translated as "Divine Craft", "Divine Vessel of God", "Magic Boat" or similar and is also homophonous with an ancient name for China (written 神州; meaning "Divine State").  Its design resembles the Russian Soyuz spacecraft, but it is larger in size.  The first launch was on November 19, 1999 and the first manned launch was on October 15, 2003.  In March 2005, an asteroid was named 8256 Shenzhou in honour of the spacecraft.

Jackson Senators<====>65796<====>Jackson Senators The Jackson Senators was the name of at least two minor league baseball teams that played in Jackson, Mississippi. First teamThe first known Jackson Senators club competed in the Cotton States League before 1953.  This was a class C minor-league club, and was the last team to represent the city of Jackson before the arrival of the class AA Jackson Mets for the 1975 season. Second TeamThe second Jackson Senators team was a member of the independent Central Baseball League from 2002 to 2005, a league that was not affiliated with Major League Baseball.   The Senators won the CBL title in 2003. 

Wang tile<====>65798<====>Wang tile Wang tiles (or Wang dominoes), first proposed by mathematician, logician, and philosopher Hao Wang in 1961, are a class of formal systems.  They are modelled visually by square tiles with a color on each side.  A set of such tiles is selected (for example the set in the picture).  Then copies of the tiles are arranged side by side with matching colors, but without rotating or reflecting the tiles. The basic question about a set of Wang tiles is whether it can tile the plane or not, i. e. , whether an entire infinite plane can be filled this way. 

San Angelo Colts<====>65799<====>San Angelo Colts  The San Angelo Colts were a professional baseball team based in San Angelo, Texas, in the United States.  The Colts were most recently a member of United League Baseball, an independent professional league which was not affiliated with Major League Baseball or Minor League Baseball.   The Colts played their home games at Foster Field. The team experienced declining attendance in later years and announced on July 2, 2014 that it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.    Although it was stated at the time that operations would not be affected, the team announced on August 11, 2014 that the final 8 games of the 2014 season would not be played.

Thebes, Greece<====>65806<====>Thebes, Greece   Thebes ( ;  , Thēbai,  ;  .    , Thíva  ) is a city in Boeotia, central Greece.  It played an important role in Greek myths, as the site of the stories of Cadmus, Oedipus, Dionysus and others.  Archaeological excavations in and around Thebes have revealed a Mycenaean settlement and clay tablets written in the Linear B script, indicating the importance of the site in the Bronze Age. Thebes was the largest city of the ancient region of Boeotia and was the leader of the Boeotian confederacy.  It was a major rival of ancient Athens, and sided with the Persians during the 480 BC invasion under Xerxes. 

Aarhus Historic Shipwreck<====>65810<====>Aarhus Historic Shipwreck}    In Australia, Aarhus Historic Shipwreck is a historical site preserving one of the victims of Smith's Rock.  The Aarhus was a 640-tonne sailing barque built in 1875 in Hamburg, Germany.  She was   long. While carrying a general cargo including kerosene from New York to Brisbane, Australia, she hit Smith's Rock, which lies about two nautical miles (4 km) north-east of Cape Moreton, and sank on 24 February 1894. The remains of the ship now lie upright in 20 metres of water, though most of the ship has been reduced to plates and ribs sticking out of the sand. 

Thebes, Egypt<====>65811<====>Thebes, Egypt  Thebes ( , Thēbai), known to the ancient Egyptians as Waset, was an ancient Egyptian city located east of the Nile about   south of the Mediterranean.  Its ruins lie within the modern Egyptian city of Luxor.  Thebes was the main city of the fourth Upper Egyptian nome (Sceptre nome) and was the capital of Egypt mainly during the Middle Kingdom and the New Kingdom.  It was close to Nubia and the eastern desert, with its valuable mineral resources and trade routes.  It was a cult center and the most venerated city of ancient Egypt during its heyday. 

Pastiche<====>65821<====>Pastiche A pastiche is a work of visual art, literature, theatre, or music that imitates the style or character of the work of one or more other artists.Unlike parody, pastiche celebrates, rather than mocks, the work it imitates.  The word pastiche is a French cognate of the Italian noun  , which is a pâté or pie-filling mixed from diverse ingredients.    Metaphorically, pastiche and pasticcio describe works that are either composed by several authors, or that incorporate stylistic elements of other artists' work.  Pastiche is an example of eclecticism in art.

Silicone<====>65827<====>Silicone Silicones, also known as polysiloxanes, are polymers that include any inert, synthetic compound made up of repeating units of siloxane, which is a chain of alternating silicon atoms and oxygen atoms, frequently combined with carbon or hydrogen or both.  They are typically heat-resistant and rubber-like, and are used in sealants, adhesives, lubricants, medicine, cooking utensils, and thermal and electrical insulation.  Some common forms include silicone oil, silicone grease, silicone rubber, silicone resin, and silicone caulk.  Silicones are of three types:1.  straight chain silicones;2.  cyclic silicones;3.  crosslinked silicones. ChemistryMore precisely called polymerized siloxanes or polysiloxanes, silicones consist of an inorganic silicon-oxygen backbone chain (⋯-Si-O-Si-O-Si-O-⋯) with organic side groups attached to the silicon atoms. 

Smithsonian Institution<====>65828<====>Smithsonian Institution   The Smithsonian Institution (   ), established on August 10, 1846 "for the increase and diffusion of knowledge," is a group of museums and research centers administered by the Government of the United States.   The institution is named after its founding donor, British scientist James Smithson.   Originally organized as the "United States National Museum," that name ceased to exist as an administrative entity in 1967.  Termed "the nation's attic"  for its eclectic holdings of 154 million items,    the Institution's nineteen museums, nine research centers, and zoo include historical and architectural landmarks, mostly located in the District of Columbia. 

Soviet submarine K-222<====>65832<====>Soviet submarine K-222}   Soviet submarine K-162 was the world's fastest submarine.The first submarine constructed with a titanium hull, she was the only vessel of the Soviet Union's Project 661 Anchar nuclear-powered attack submarine design.  The boat is best known in the West by its NATO reporting name Papa class.  K-162 was renamed K-222 in 1978.  DesignThe project was intentionally forced to be highly innovative, as it was forbidden to reuse prior technical solutions.   While enforcing innovation, this also slowed the development.  Project 661 began in 1959, with design task assigned to OKB-16, one of the two predecessors (the other being SKB-143) of the famous Malachite Central Design Bureau, which would eventually become one of the three Soviet/Russian submarine design centers, along with Rubin Design Bureau and Lazurit Central Design Bureau. 

Schindler's List<====>65834<====>Schindler's List    Schindler's List is a 1993 American epic historical period drama film directed and co-produced by Steven Spielberg and scripted by Steven Zaillian.  It is based on the novel Schindler's Ark by Australian novelist Thomas Keneally.  The film relates a period in the life of Oskar Schindler, an ethnic German businessman, during which he saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly Polish-Jewish refugees from the Holocaust by employing them in his factories during World War II.  It stars Liam Neeson as Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as SS officer Amon Göth, and Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern. 

Please Please Me<====>65835<====>Please Please Me    Please Please Me is the debut studio album by English rock band the Beatles.  Parlophone rush-released the album on 22 March 1963  in the United Kingdom to capitalise on the success of their singles "Please Please Me" (No.  1 on most lists though only No.  2 on Record Retailer)  and "Love Me Do" (No.  17). Of the album's 14 songs, eight were written by Lennon–McCartney (originally credited "McCartney–Lennon"), early evidence of what Rolling Stone later called "[their invention of] the idea of the self-contained rock band, writing their own hits and playing their own instruments. 

Republicanism in Australia<====>65836<====>Republicanism in Australia Republicanism in Australia is a movement to change Australia's system of government from a constitutional monarchy to a republic.  Republicanism was first espoused in Australia before Federation in 1901.  After a period of decline after Federation, the movement again became prominent at the end of the 20th century after successive legal and socio-cultural changes loosened Australia's ties with the United Kingdom. Politically, republicanism is officially supported by the Labor Party and the Greens, and is also supported by some Liberal Party members of the Australian parliament including leader and prime minister Malcolm Turnbull. 

The Art of War<====>65837<====>The Art of War    The Art of War is an ancient Chinese military treatise dating from the Spring and Autumn period in 5th century BC.  The work, which is attributed to the ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu ("Master Sun", also spelled Sunzi), is composed of 13 chapters.  Each one is devoted to a distinct aspect of warfare and how that applies to military strategy and tactics.  For almost 1,500 years it was the lead text in an anthology that would be formalised as the Seven Military Classics by Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1080.

Hypothyroidism<====>65845<====>Hypothyroidism  Hypothyroidism, also called underactive thyroid or low thyroid, is a disorder of the endocrine system in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone.   It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of tiredness, constipation, depression, and weight gain.   Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goitre.Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby or cretinism.Worldwide, too little iodine in the diet is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. 

Vitiligo<====>65847<====>Vitiligo    Vitiligo is a long-term skin condition characterized by patches of the skin losing their pigment.   The patches of skin affected become white and usually have sharp margins.   The hair from the skin may also become white.   Inside the mouth and nose may also be involved.Typically both sides of the body are affected.   Often the patches begin on areas of skin that are exposed to the sun.   It is more noticeable in people with dark skin.   Vitiligo may result in psychological stress and those affected may be stigmatized.

Idiopathic hypoglycemia<====>65852<====>Idiopathic hypoglycemiaIdiopathic hypoglycemia is, literally, a medical condition in which the glucose level in the blood (blood glucose) is abnormally low due to an undeterminable cause.  This is considered an incomplete and unsatisfactory diagnosis by physicians and is rarely used by endocrinologists, as it implies an unfinished diagnostic evaluation.  In general, the more severe the hypoglycemia and the more clearly it is proven, the less likely it is to remain "idiopathic". Idiopathic hypoglycemia can also be a synonym for reactive hypoglycemia or for hypoglycemia that is not diagnosed by a physician and does not fulfill the Whipple triad criteria. 

Eliezer Yudkowsky<====>65858<====>Eliezer Yudkowsky  Eliezer Shlomo Yudkowsky (born September 11, 1979) is an American AI researcher and writer best known for popularising the idea of friendly artificial intelligence. He is a co-founder and research fellow at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, a private research nonprofit based in Berkeley, California.   He never attended high school or college and has no formal education in artificial intelligence.  Yudkowsky claims that he is self-taught in the field.

Lu Xun<====>65861<====>Lu XunLu Xun, formerly romanized Lu Hsün, was the pen name of Zhou Shuren (25 September 1881 – 19 October 1936), a leading figure of modern Chinese literature.  Writing in Vernacular Chinese as well as Classical Chinese, Lu Xun was a short story writer, editor, translator, literary critic, essayist, poet, and designer.  In the 1930s he became the titular head of the League of Left-Wing Writers in Shanghai. Lu Xun was born into a family of landlords and government officials in Shaoxing, Zhejiang; the family's financial resources declined over the course of his youth. 

Angina<====>65862<====>Angina   Angina, also known as angina pectoris, is chest pain or pressure, usually due to not enough blood flow to the heart muscle.  Angina is usually due to obstruction or spasm of the coronary arteries.   Other causes include anemia, abnormal heart rhythms, and heart failure.  The main mechanism of coronary artery obstruction is an atherosclerosis.  The term derives from the Latin angere ("to strangle") and pectus ("chest"), and can therefore be translated as "a strangling feeling in the chest". There is a weak relationship between severity of pain and degree of oxygen deprivation in the heart muscle (i. 

Poland, Ohio<====>65865<====>Poland, Ohio  Poland is a village about   southeast of Youngstown in Mahoning County, Ohio, United States.  The population was 2,555 at the 2010 census.It is part of the Youngstown-Warren-Boardman, OH-PA Metropolitan Statistical Area. History In 1796, Poland Township was the first charted township in the Connecticut Western Reserve, being the southeastern most portion (Township 1, Range 1).  The township was founded by Jonathan Fowler, who fell in love with Yellow Creek which flows through Poland.  He owned an inn near the river which still stands as the oldest building in Poland. 

Operation TIPS<====>65866<====>Operation TIPSOperation TIPS, where the last part is an acronym for the Terrorism Information and Prevention System, was a domestic intelligence-gathering program designed by President George W.  Bush to have United States citizens report suspicious activity.  The program's website implied that US workers who had access to private citizens' homes, such as many cable installers and telephone repair workers, would be reporting on what was in people's homes if it were deemed "suspicious. "It came under intense scrutiny in July 2002 when the Washington Post alleged in an editorial that the program was vaguely defined, and investigative political journalist Ritt Goldstein observed in Australia's Sydney Morning Herald  that TIPS would provide America with a higher percentage of 'citizen spies' than the former East Germany had under the notorious Stasi secret police. 

Eileen Chang<====>65867<====>Eileen Chang    Eileen Chang (September 30, 1920 – September 8, 1995) was one of the most influential modern Chinese writers.    Chang is noted for her fiction writings that deal with the tensions between men and women in love, and are considered by some scholars to be among the best Chinese literature of the period.  Chang's portrayal of life in 1940s Shanghai and Japanese-occupied Hong Kong is remarkable in its focus on everyday life and the absence of the political subtext which characterised many other writers of the period.  The poet and University of Southern California professor Dominic Cheung commented "had it not been for the political division between the Nationalist and Communist Chinese, she would have almost certainly won a Nobel Prize". 

Qian Zhongshu<====>65870<====>Qian Zhongshu  Names Traditional Chinese:   Simplified Chinese:    Pinyin: Qián Zhōngshū Wade-Giles: Ch'ien Chung-shu Zi: Zheliang (哲良)   Mocun (默存) Hao: Huaiju (槐聚) Qian Zhongshu (November 21, 1910 – December 19, 1998) was a Chinese literary scholar and writer, known for his wit and erudition. He is best known for his satirical novel Fortress Besieged.  His works of non-fiction are characterised by their large amount of quotations in both Chinese and Western languages (including English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Latin).   He also played an important role in digitizing Chinese classics late in his life. 

Sweden Democrats<====>65873<====>Sweden DemocratsSweden Democrats or Swedish Democrats  ( , SD) is a nationalist political party in Sweden that was founded in 1988.   The party describes itself as social conservative with a nationalist foundation,however the party has been described as far-right, *  right-wing populist, Rydgren (2006), p.  10national-conservative,    and anti-immigration.  *  The party had its roots in Swedish fascism  and was a part of the white supremacy movement in the late-1980s;  initially, it was characterized by right-wing extremism and activism. 

Compact Cassette<====>65880<====>Compact Cassette  The Compact Audio Cassette (CAC) or Musicassette (MC), also commonly called the cassette tape or simply tape or cassette, is an analog magnetic tape recording format for audio recording and playback.  It was released by Philips in 1963, having been developed in Hasselt, Belgium.   Compact cassettes come in two forms, either already containing content as a pre-recorded cassette, or as a fully recordable "blank" cassette.  Both forms are reversible by the user.  The compact cassette technology was originally designed for dictation machines, but improvements in fidelity led the Compact Cassette to supplant the Stereo 8-track cartridge and reel-to-reel tape recording in most non-professional applications. 

Dave Thompson (comedian)<====>65883<====>Dave Thompson (comedian)  Dave Thompson (born 1 January 1960) is an English stand-up comedian, actor and writer who hit the headlines in July 1997 after being removed from the role of Tinky Winky in the children's television series Teletubbies after 70 episodes.  The BBC said in a letter to Thompson that his "interpretation of the role was not acceptable".   In an interview for The Pod Delusion, Thompson revealed that his contract had already been terminated at the end of the first season's filming – some time before the media allegations concerning Tinky Winky had emerged.  He also claimed that a number of other Ragdoll Productions staff had been fired at the same time, the implication being that the mainstream media account of his termination was incorrect. 

Microphone<====>65886<====>Microphone  A microphone, colloquially nicknamed mic or mike ( ),  is a transducer that converts sound into an electrical signal. Microphones are used in many applications such as telephones, hearing aids, public address systems for concert halls and public events, motion picture production, live and recorded audio engineering, sound recording, two-way radios, megaphones,  radio and television broadcasting, and in computers for recording voice, speech recognition, VoIP, and for non-acoustic purposes such as ultrasonic sensors or knock sensors. Several different types of microphone are in use, which employ different methods to convert the air pressure variations of a sound wave to an electrical signal. 

Electromagnetic induction<====>65888<====>Electromagnetic inductionElectromagnetic or magnetic induction is the production of an electromotive force (i. e. , voltage) across an electrical conductor in a changing magnetic field. Michael Faraday is generally credited with the discovery of induction in 1831, and James Clerk Maxwell mathematically described it as Faraday's law of induction.  Lenz's law describes the direction of the induced field.  Faraday's law was later generalized to become the Maxwell–Faraday equation, one of the four Maxwell's equations in James Clerk Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism. Electromagnetic induction has found many applications in technology, including electrical components such as inductors and transformers, and devices such as electric motors and generators. 

Magnetic flux<====>65890<====>Magnetic flux   In physics, specifically electromagnetism, the magnetic flux (often denoted   or  ) through a surface is the surface integral of the normal component of the magnetic field B passing through that surface.  The SI unit of magnetic flux is the weber (Wb) (in derived units: volt-seconds), and the CGS unit is the maxwell.  Magnetic flux is usually measured with a fluxmeter, which contains measuring coils and electronics, that evaluates the change of voltage in the measuring coils to calculate the magnetic flux. Description The magnetic interaction is described in terms of a vector field, where each point in space (and time) is associated with a vector that determines what force a moving charge would experience at that point (see Lorentz force). 

Boyle's law<====>65891<====>Boyle's law   Boyle's law (sometimes referred to as the Boyle–Mariotte law, or Mariotte's law ) is an experimental gas law that describes how the pressure of a gas tends to increase as the volume of the container decreases.  A modern statement of Boyle's law is The absolute pressure exerted by a given mass of an ideal gas is inversely proportional to the volume it occupies if the temperature and amount of gas remain unchanged within a closed system.   Levine, Ira.  N.  (1978), p.  12 gives the original definition.   Mathematically, Boyle's law can be stated as P \propto \frac{1}{V} or  PV = k where P is the pressure of the gas, V is the volume of the gas, and k is a constant. 

Weber<====>65892<====>Weber Weber ( ,   or  ; German:  ) is a surname of German origin, derived from the noun meaning "weaver".

Electromotive force<====>65894<====>Electromotive force   Electromotive force, abbreviated emf (denoted  \mathcal{E}  and measured in volts),  is the electrical intensity or "pressure" developed by a source of electrical energy such as a battery or generator.A device that converts other forms of energy into electrical energy (a "transducer") provides an emf at its output.   (The word "force" in this case is not used to mean mechanical force, as may be measured in pounds or newtons. )In electromagnetic induction, emf can be defined around a closed loop of conductor as the electromagnetic work that would be done on an  electric charge (an electron in this instance) if it travels once around the loop. 

Wire wrap<====>65897<====>Wire wrap  Wire wrap was invented to wire telephone crossbar switches, and later adapted to construct electronic circuit boards.  Electronic components mounted on an insulating board are interconnected by lengths of insulated wire run between their  terminals, with the connections made by wrapping several turns around a component lead or a socket pin. Wires can be wrapped by hand or by machine, and can be hand-modified afterwards.  It was popular for large-scale manufacturing in the 60s and early 70s, and continues today  to be used for short runs and prototypes.  The method eliminates the design and fabrication of a printed circuit board. 

Digital Audio Tape<====>65899<====>Digital Audio TapeDigital Audio Tape (DAT or R-DAT) is a signal recording and playback medium developed by Sony and introduced in 1987.   In appearance it is similar to a Compact Cassette, using 3. 81 mm / 0. 15" (commonly referred to as 4 mm) magnetic tape enclosed in a protective shell, but is roughly half the size at 73 mm × 54 mm × 10. 5 mm.  As the name suggests, the recording is digital rather than analog.  DAT has the ability to record at higher, equal or lower sampling rates than a CD (48, 44. 

Picric acid<====>65900<====>Picric acid Picric acid is an organic compound with the formula (O 2 N) 3 C 6 H 2 OH.   Its IUPAC name is  2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP).  The name "picric" comes from the Greek πικρός (pikros), meaning "bitter", reflecting its bitter taste.   It is one of the most acidic phenols.  Like other highly nitrated organic compounds, picric acid is an explosive, which was once its primary use.  It has also been used in medicine (antiseptic, burn treatments) and dyes. HistoryPicric acid was probably first mentioned in the alchemical writings of Johann Rudolf Glauber in 1742. 

Ideal gas<====>65905<====>Ideal gas An ideal gas is a theoretical gas composed of many randomly moving point particles whose only interactions are perfectly elastic collisions.  The ideal gas concept is useful because it obeys the ideal gas law, a simplified equation of state, and is amenable to analysis under statistical mechanics. In most usual conditions (for instance at standard temperature and pressure), most real gases behave qualitatively like an ideal gas.  Many gases such as nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, noble gases, and some heavier gases like carbon dioxide can be treated like ideal gases within reasonable tolerances.Generally, a gas behaves more like an ideal gas at higher temperature and lower pressure,  as the potential energy due to intermolecular forces becomes less significant compared with the particles' kinetic energy, and the size of the molecules becomes less significant compared to the empty space between them. 

Elastic collision<====>65907<====>Elastic collision An elastic collision is an encounter between two bodies  in which the total kinetic energy of the two bodies after the encounter is equal to their total kinetic energy before the encounter.  Perfectly elastic collisions occur only if there is no net conversion of kinetic energy into other forms (such as heat or noise) and therefore they do not normally occur in reality. During the collision of small objects, kinetic energy is first converted to potential energy associated with a repulsive force between the particles (when the particles move against this force, i. e.  the angle between the force and the relative velocity is obtuse), then this potential energy is converted back to kinetic energy (when the particles move with this force, i. 

Inelastic collision<====>65908<====>Inelastic collisionAn inelastic collision, in contrast to an elastic collision, is a collision in which kinetic energy is not conserved due to the action of internal friction. In collisions of macroscopic bodies, all kinetic energy is turned into vibrational energy of the atoms, causing a heating effect, and the bodies are deformed. The molecules of a gas or liquid rarely experience perfectly elastic collisions because kinetic energy is exchanged between the molecules' translational motion and their internal degrees of freedom with each collision.  At any one instant, half the collisions are – to a varying extent – inelastic (the pair possesses less kinetic energy after the collision than before), and half could be described as “super-elastic” (possessing more kinetic energy after the collision than before). 

Neonatal heel prick<====>65909<====>Neonatal heel prickThe neonatal heel prick is a blood collection procedure done on newborns.  It consists of making a pinprick puncture in one heel of the newborn to collect their blood.   This technique is used frequently as the main way to collect blood from neonates.   Other techniques include venous or arterial needle sticks, cord blood sampling, or umbilical line collection.   This technique is often utilized for the Guthrie test, where it is used to soaking the blood into pre-printed collection cards known as Guthrie cards.The classical Guthrie test is named after Robert Guthrie, an American bacteriologist and physician who devised it in 1962. 

Printed circuit board<====>65910<====>Printed circuit board   A printed circuit board (PCB) mechanically supports and electrically connects electronic components or electrical components using conductive tracks, pads and other features etched from one or more sheet layers of copper laminated onto and/or between sheet layers of a non-conductive substrate.  Components are generally soldered onto the PCB to both electrically connect and mechanically fasten them to it. Printed circuit boards are used in all but the simplest electronic products.  They are also used in some electrical products, such as passive switch boxes. Alternatives to PCBs include wire wrap and point-to-point construction, both once popular but now rarely used. 

Equations of motion<====>65913<====>Equations of motion In mathematical physics, equations of motion are equations that describe the behaviour of a physical system in terms of its motion as a function of time.  Encyclopaedia of Physics (second Edition), R. G.  Lerner, G. L.  Trigg, VHC Publishers, 1991, ISBN (Verlagsgesellschaft) 3-527-26954-1 (VHC Inc. ) 0-89573-752-3  More specifically, the equations of motion describe the behaviour of a physical system as a set of mathematical functions in terms of dynamic variables: normally spatial coordinates and time are used, but others are also possible, such as momentum components and time.  The most general choice are generalized coordinates which can be any convenient variables characteristic of the physical system. 

Kinematics<====>65914<====>Kinematics  Kinematics is a branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of points, bodies (objects), and systems of bodies (groups of objects) without considering the mass of each or the forces that caused the motion. Kinematics, as a field of study, is often referred to as the "geometry of motion" and is occasionally seen as a branch of mathematics.A kinematics problem begins by describing the geometry of the system and declaring the initial conditions of any known values of position, velocity and/or acceleration of points within the system. 

List of newspaper comic strips<====>65918<====>List of newspaper comic strips The following is a list of comic strips.  Dates after names indicate the time frames when the strips appeared.  There is usually a fair degree of accuracy about a start date, but because of rights being transferred or the very gradual loss of appeal of a particular strip, the termination date is sometimes uncertain.  In the event a strip has its own page, the originator of the strip is listed.  Otherwise, all creators who worked on a strip are listed.  Many of characters appeared in both strip and comic book format as well as in other media. 

Point-to-point construction<====>65919<====>Point-to-point construction Point-to-point construction is a non-automated method of construction of electronics circuits widely used before the use of printed circuit boards (PCBs) and automated assembly gradually became widespread following their introduction in the 1950s.  Circuits using thermionic valves (vacuum tubes) were relatively large, relatively simple (the number of large, hot, expensive devices which needed replacing was minimised), and used large sockets, all of which made the PCB less obviously advantageous than with later complex semiconductor circuits.  Point-to-point construction is still used to construct prototype equipment with few or heavy electronic components. Before point-to-point connection, electrical assemblies used screws or wire nuts to hold wires to an insulating wooden or ceramic board. 

Treaty of Shimonoseki<====>65922<====>Treaty of Shimonoseki The   was a treaty signed at the Shunpanrō hotel, Shimonoseki, Japan on 17 April 1895, between the Empire of Japan and the Qing Empire, ending the First Sino-Japanese War.  The peace conference took place from March 20 to 17 April 1895.  This treaty followed and superseded the Sino-Japanese Friendship and Trade Treaty of 1871. Treaty terms Article 1: China recognizes definitively the full and complete independence and autonomy of Korea, and, in consequence, the payment of tribute and the performance of ceremonies and formalities by Korea to China, that are in derogation of such independence and autonomy, shall wholly cease for the future. 

The Surgeon of Crowthorne<====>65923<====>The Surgeon of Crowthorne The Surgeon of Crowthorne: A Tale of Murder, Madness and the Love of Words is a book by Simon Winchester that was first published in England in 1998.  It was retitled The Professor and the Madman: A Tale of Murder, Insanity, and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary in the United States and Canada. It tells the story of the making of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and one of its most prolific early contributors, Dr.  W.  C.  Minor, a retired United States Army surgeon.  Minor was, at the time, imprisoned in the Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum, near the village of Crowthorne in Berkshire, England. 

Photoplotter<====>65924<====>Photoplotter A photoplotter is an electro-mechanical-optical machine that exposes a latent image on a media, usually high-contrast monochromatic (black-and-white) photographic film, using a light source under computer control.  Once the exposing step is complete, the media is processed in a film processor using a developer solution, along with fixing, washing, and drying. Nearly any conceivable image can be formed.  Photoplotters are used primarily for the production of PCBs (printed circuit boards) and IC packaging.  Other application areas include chemical milling and specialized graphic arts.   Photoplotting is the first step of making photolithography masks for printed circuit boards. 

Angular displacement<====>65926<====>Angular displacement  Angular displacement of a body is the angle in radians (degrees, revolutions) through which a point revolves around a centre or line has been rotated in a specified sense about a specified axis.  When an object rotates about its axis, the motion cannot simply be analyzed as a particle, as in circular motion it undergoes a changing velocity and acceleration at any time (t).   When dealing with the rotation of an object, it becomes simpler to consider the body itself rigid.   A body is generally considered rigid when the separations between all the particles remains constant throughout the objects motion, so for example parts of its mass are not flying off. 

Angular velocity<====>65927<====>Angular velocity   In physics, the angular velocity of a particle is the time rate of change of its angular position relative to the origin.  The SI unit of angular velocity is radians per second.  Angular velocity is usually represented by the symbol omega (ω, sometimes Ω). In three dimensions, the angular velocity of a particle can be represented as a vector, with its direction pointing perpendicular to both the position and velocity vectors, in a fashion specified (conventionally) by the right-hand rule.   (EM1) Angular velocity of a particleParticle in two dimensionsThe angular velocity of a particle is measured relative to a point, called the origin. 

Bass Strait<====>65928<====>Bass Strait   Bass Strait   is a sea strait separating Tasmania from the Australian mainland, specifically the state of Victoria. ExtentThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of Bass Strait as follows:   On the west.  The eastern limit of the Great Australian Bight [being a line from Cape Otway, Australia, to King Island and thence to Cape Grim, the northwest extreme of Tasmania ] . On the east.  The western limit of the Tasman Sea between Gabo Island and Eddystone Point [being a line from Gabo Island (near Cape Howe, 37°30'S) to the northeast point of East Sister Island (148°E) thence along the 148th meridian to Flinders Island; beyond this Island a line running to the Eastward of the Vansittart Shoals to [Cape] Barren Island, and from Cape Barren (the easternmost point of [Cape] Barren Island) to Eddystone Point (41°S) in Tasmania]. 

Angular acceleration<====>65929<====>Angular acceleration  Angular acceleration is the  rate of change of angular velocity.  In three dimensions, it is a pseudovector.  In SI units, it is measured in radians per second squared (rad/s ), and is usually denoted by the Greek letter alpha (α).  Mathematical definitionThe angular acceleration vector is defined as: {\boldsymbol{\alpha}} = \frac{d{\boldsymbol{\omega}}}{dt} ,where  {\boldsymbol{\omega}}  is the angular velocity vector. Equation of Motion  The angular acceleration of a point particle α can be connected to the applied torque τ by the following equation: {I\boldsymbol{\alpha}} = \boldsymbol{\tau} - 2mr\frac{d{r}}{dt}\boldsymbol{\omega} ,where m is the mass of the particle and I is its moment of inertia. 

ANSI escape code<====>65930<====>ANSI escape code    ANSI escape sequences are a standard for in-band signaling to control the cursor location, color, and other options on video text terminals.  Certain sequences of bytes, most starting with Esc and '[', are embedded into the text, which the terminal looks for and interprets as commands, not as character codes. ANSI sequences were introduced in the 1970s to replace vendor-specific sequences and became widespread in the computer equipment market by the early 1980s.  They were used by the nascent bulletin board systems to offer improved displays compared to earlier systems lacking cursor movement, a primary reason they became a standard adopted by all manufacturers. 

Jean Hersholt<====>65931<====>Jean Hersholt  Jean Pierre Hersholt (12 July 1886 – 2 June 1956) was a Danish-born actor who lived in the United States, where he was a leading film and radio talent, best known for his 17 years starring on radio in Dr.  Christian and for playing Shirley Temple's grandfather in Heidi.  Obituary Variety, 6 June 1956, p.  63.   Asked how to pronounce his name, he told The Literary Digest, "In English, her'sholt; in Danish, hairs'hult. "  Of his total credits, 75 were silent films and 65 were sound films (140 total); he directed four. 

Tael<====>65937<====>Tael  Tael ( ; "Tael" entry at the OED Online.    ) or tahil can refer to any one of several weight measures of the Far East.  Most commonly, it refers to the Chinese tael, a part of the Chinese system of weights and currency. In Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia it is equivalent to 10 mace ( ) or   catty,albeit with slightly different metric equivalents in these two places.  These Chinese units of measurement are usually used in Chinese herbal medicine stores as well as gold and silver exchange.

Judith Durham<====>65942<====>Judith Durham  Judith Mavis Durham   (born Judith Mavis Cock; 3 July 1943) is an Australian singer and musician who became the lead singer for the Australian popular folk music group The Seekers in 1963.  The group subsequently became the first Australian pop music group to achieve major chart and sales success in the United Kingdom and the United States, and have sold over 50 million records worldwide.  Durham left the group in mid-1968 to pursue her solo career.  In 1993, Durham began to make sporadic recordings and performances with The Seekers, though she remains primarily a solo performer. 

Plankalkül<====>65944<====>Plankalkül  Plankalkül ( , "Plan Calculus") is a programming language designed for engineering purposes by Konrad Zuse  between 1942 and 1945.  It was the first high-level (non-von Neumann) programming language to be designed for a computer. "Kalkül" means formal system – the Hilbert-style deduction system is for example originally called "Hilbert-Kalkül", so Plankalkül means "formal system for planning". HistoryWhile working on his intended doctoral dissertation, Konrad Zuse developed a formal system of notation for algorithms because no such system was yet known.This notation could only handle linear (unbranched and unlooped) calculation plans. 

Consumer confidence index<====>65946<====>Consumer confidence index  The U. S.  consumer confidence index (CCI) is an indicator designed to measure consumer confidence, which is defined as the degree of optimism on the state of the economy that consumers are expressing through their activities of savings and spending.  Global consumer confidence is not measured.  Country by country analysis indicates huge variance around the globe.  In an interconnected global economy, tracking international consumer confidence is a lead indicator of economic trends.    In the United States consumer confidence is issued monthly by The Conference Board, an independent economic research organization, and is based on 5,000 households. 

Disulfide<====>65948<====>DisulfideIn chemistry, a disulfide refers to a functional group with the structure R−S−S−R′.  The linkage is also called an SS-bond or sometimes a disulfide bridge and is usually derived by the coupling of two thiol groups.   The connection is a persulfide, in analogy to its congener, peroxide (R−O−O−R′), but this terminology is rarely used, except in reference to hydrodisulfides (R−S−S−H compounds). In inorganic chemistry disulfide usually refers to the corresponding anion   ( − S−S − ), for example in disulfur dichloride. Organic disulfides A selection of disulfides FeS 2 , "fool's gold"   S 2 Cl 2 , a common industrial chemical   cystine, crosslinker in many proteins   lipoic acid, a vitamin   Ph 2 S 2 , a common organic disulfide   PropertiesThe disulfide bonds are strong, with a typical bond dissociation energy of 60 kcal/mol (251 kJ mol −1 ). 

Fielding (cricket)<====>65951<====>Fielding (cricket)   Fielding in the sport of cricket is the action of fielders in collecting the ball after it is struck by the batsman, to limit the number of runs that the batsman scores and/or to get the batsman out by catching the ball in flight or by running the batsman out.  There are a number of recognised fielding positions, and they can be categorised into the offside and leg side of the field.  A fielder or fieldsman may field the ball with any part of his body.  However, if while the ball is in play he wilfully fields it otherwise (e. 

Antigonae<====>65952<====>Antigonae  Antigonae (Antigone), written by Carl Orff, was first presented on 9 August 1949 under the direction of Ferenc Fricsay in the Felsenreitschule, Salzburg, Austria, as part of the Salzburg Festival.  Antigonae is in Orff's words a "musical setting" for the Greek tragedy of the same name by Sophocles.  However, it functions as an opera. Orff used the German translation of Sophocles' play by Friedrich Hölderlin.  The original play was written in 442 BC, and the German translation copies faithfully the mood and movement of Greek tragedy. The musicWith this work Orff drew a line in his musical output, setting up a demarcation between pre-Antigonae and post-Antigonae style. 

Antigone (Sophocles play)<====>65953<====>Antigone (Sophocles play)  Antigone (   ;  ) is a tragedy by Sophocles written in or before 441 BC. It is the third of the three Theban plays chronologically, but was the first written.   The play expands on the Theban legend that predated it and picks up where Aeschylus' Seven Against Thebes ends. SynopsisIn the beginning of the play, two brothers, Eteocles and Polyneices, leading opposite sides in Thebes' civil war died fighting each other for the throne.  Creon, the new ruler of Thebes, has decided that Eteocles will be honored and Polyneices will be in public shame. 

John Cage<====>65954<====>John Cage    John Milton Cage Jr.  (September 5, 1912 – August 12, 1992) was an American composer and music theorist.  A pioneer of indeterminacy in music, electroacoustic music, and non-standard use of musical instruments, Cage was one of the leading figures of the post-war avant-garde.  Critics have lauded him as one of the most influential composers of the 20th century. He was also instrumental in the development of modern dance, mostly through his association with choreographer Merce Cunningham, who was also Cage's romantic partner for most of their lives. 

Denim<====>65955<====>Denim  Denim is a sturdy cotton warp-faced    textile in which the weft passes under two or more warp threads.  This twill weaving produces a diagonal ribbing that distinguishes it from cotton duck. The most common denim is indigo denim, in which the warp thread is dyed, while the weft thread is left white.  As a result of the warp-faced twill weaving, one side of the textile is dominated by the blue warp threads and the other side is dominated by the white weft threads.  This causes blue jeans to be white on the inside. 

Rigoletto (film)<====>65956<====>Rigoletto (film) Rigoletto is a 1993 musical fantasy/drama produced for Feature Films for Families. Plot Rigoletto stars Joseph Paur as Ari Ribaldi and Ivey Lloyd as Bonnie Nelson, a singer. Bonnie reads a part of Rigoletto each night to her younger brother.  The film time shifts to the 1930s, during America's Great Depression.  The following scene shows an old house which newcomer Mr.  Ribaldi purchases. The next day, Bonnie performs in a singing contest.  While Bonnie does not win, she manages to attract the attention of a mysterious man.  He says nothing to her and only nods and leaves. 

Rigoletto<====>65957<====>Rigoletto  Rigoletto ( ) is an opera in three acts  by Giuseppe Verdi.  The Italian libretto was written by Francesco Maria Piave based on the play Le roi s'amuse by Victor Hugo.  Despite serious initial problems with the Austrian censors who had control over northern Italian theatres at the time, the opera had a triumphant premiere at La Fenice in Venice on 11 March 1851. It is widely considered to be the first of the operatic masterpieces of Verdi's middle-to-late career.  Its tragic story revolves around the licentious Duke of Mantua, his hunch-backed court jester Rigoletto, and Rigoletto's beautiful daughter Gilda. 

Xukuru people<====>65959<====>Xukuru people The Xukuru (Xucuru) are an indigenous people of Brazil, with a population of approximately 8,500, living in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. They have recently gained governmental  recognition of their rights to their indigenous homeland in the Ororubo Mountains, though this has brought them into conflict with the local settler population of the region. In 1998, a Xukuru leader, Chicão (Francisco Lacerda), was assassinated, apparently because of his opposition to the encroachment of ranchers in Xukuru territory. However his children carried on his legacy.External linkswww.xukuru.de DEFAULTSORT 

Pete Sampras<====>65961<====>Pete Sampras Pete Sampras  (   ; born August 12, 1971) is a retired Greek American tennis player widely regarded as one of the greatest in the history of the sport. He was a right-handed player with a single-handed backhand and a precise and powerful serve that earned him the nickname "Pistol Pete".  His professional career began in 1988 and ended at the 2002 US Open, which he won, defeating rival Andre Agassi in the final. Sampras was the first man to win 14 Grand Slam singles titles (seven Wimbledon, five US Open, two Australian Open). 

George Everest<====>65962<====>George Everest   Colonel Sir George Everest CB FRS FRAS FRGS ( ; 4 July 1790 – 1 December 1866) was a British surveyor and geographer who served as Surveyor General of India from 1830 to 1843.  He is best known for having Mount Everest, the highest mountain on Earth, named in his honour. After receiving a military education, Everest joined the East India Company and arrived in India at the age of 16.  He was eventually made an assistant to William Lambton on the Great Trigonometric Survey, and replaced Lambton as superintendent of the survey in 1823. 

Pétanque<====>65964<====>PétanquePétanque ( ;    ) is a form of boules where the goal is to toss or roll hollow steel balls as close as possible to a small wooden ball called a cochonnet (literally "piglet") or jack,  while standing inside a circle with both feet on the ground.  The game is normally played on hard dirt or gravel.   It can be played in public areas in parks, or in dedicated facilities called boulodromes.   Similar games are bocce, bowls and (adapted to ice) curling. The current form of the game originated in 1907 or 1910 in La Ciotat, in Provence, France.

Jaundice<====>65980<====>Jaundice   Jaundice, also known as icterus, is a yellowish or greenish pigmentation of the skin and whites of the eyes due to high bilirubin levels.   It is commonly associated with itchiness.The feces may be pale and the urine dark.   Jaundice in babies occurs in over half in the first week following birth and in most is not a problem.    If bilirubin levels in babies are very high for too long, a type of brain damage, known as kernicterus, may occur.   Causes of jaundice vary from non-serious to potentially fatal. 

Stephen E. Ambrose<====>65984<====>Stephen E.  Ambrose  Stephen Edward Ambrose (January 10, 1936 – October 13, 2002) was an American historian and biographer of U. S.  Presidents Dwight D.  Eisenhower and Richard Nixon.  He was a longtime professor of history at the University of New Orleans and the author of many bestselling volumes of American popular history. Beginning late in his life and continuing after his death, however, evidence and reports have continued to surface documenting longtime patterns of plagiarism and inaccuracies in many of his published writings and other work.  In response to one of the early reports, Ambrose said he was not "out there stealing other people's writings. 

Alhucemas Islands<====>65992<====>Alhucemas Islands  The Alhucemas Islands is a group of islands and one of the Spanish plazas de soberanía just off the Moroccan coast in the Alboran Sea. OverviewPeñón de Alhucemas, together with the islets of Isla de Mar and Isla de Tierra slightly to the west, form the Alhucemas Islands.  They are located   off the Moroccan town of Al Hoceima, or Alhucemas (former Villa Sanjurjo),   east of Ceuta and   west of Melilla.  The aggregate land area of the group of three islands is 4. 6 ha or  . Peñón de Alhucemas ( , "Lavender Rock") is a tiny rock island, measuring   east-west and up to   north-south, with an area 1. 

University of Fort Hare<====>65996<====>University of Fort Hare   The University of Fort Hare is a public university in Alice, Eastern Cape, South Africa. It was a key institution of higher education for black Africans from 1916 to 1959.  It offered a Western-style academic education to students from across sub-Saharan Africa, creating a black African elite.  Fort Hare alumni were part of many subsequent independence movements and governments of newly independent African countries. In 1959, the university was subsumed by the apartheid system, but it is now part of South Africa's post-apartheid public higher education system. HistoryOriginally, Fort Hare was a British fort in the wars between British settlers and the Xhosa of the 19th century. 

Ukko<====>66001<====>Ukko Ukko,  or Äijä or Äijö (Finnish: male grandparent, grandfather, old man),   parallel in Estonian mythology to Uku,  is the god of the sky, weather, harvest and thunder  in Finnish mythology.  Ukkonen, the Finnish word for thunder is the diminutive form of the name Ukko.  Compare to English thunder (   In Finnish, diminutive formations do not carry the same pejorative or belittling connotations they do in some other languages, e. g.  Latin.   Some researchers believe that Ilmarinen, another Finnic sky god, is the origin of Ukko,   while some others believe that Ukko's original name was Baltic Perkele. 

Cathy Freeman<====>66002<====>Cathy Freeman   Catherine Astrid Salome "Cathy" Freeman, OAM (born 16 February 1973) is an Australian former sprinter, who specialised in the 400 metres event.  She would occasionally compete in other track events, but 400m was her main event.  Her personal best of 48. 63 currently ranks her as the sixth fastest woman of all time, set while finishing second to Marie-Jose Perec's number-three time at the 1996 Olympics.   She became the Olympic champion for the women's 400 metres at the 2000 Summer Olympics, at which she lit the Olympic Flame.  Freeman was the first Australian Indigenous person to become a Commonwealth Games gold medallist at age 16 in 1990. 

Puppet state<====>66004<====>Puppet state  A puppet state is a state that is supposedly independent but is in fact dependent upon an outside power.It is nominally sovereign but effectively controlled by a foreign or otherwise alien power, for reasons such as financial interests.    A puppet state preserves the external paraphernalia of independence like a name, flag, anthem, constitution, law codes and motto but in reality is an organ of another state which created or sponsored the government.Puppet states are not recognized as legitimate under international law.    Etymology of the termIn the Middle Ages vassal states existed which were based on delegation of rule of a country from a King to noble men of lower rank.

Newcomb's paradox<====>66012<====>Newcomb's paradoxIn philosophy and mathematics, Newcomb's paradox, also referred to as Newcomb's problem, is a thought experiment involving a game between two players, one of whom purports to be able to predict the future.  Whether the problem actually is a paradox is disputed. Newcomb's paradox was created by William Newcomb of the University of California's Lawrence Livermore Laboratory.  However, it was first analyzed and was published in a philosophy paper spread to the philosophical community by Robert Nozick in 1969,    and appeared in Martin Gardner's Scientific American column in 1974.    Reprinted with an addendum and annotated bibliography in his book The Colossal Book of Mathematics ( )  Today it is a much debated problem in the philosophical branch of decision theory. 

Field gun<====>66013<====>Field gun  A field gun is a field artillery piece.  Originally the term referred to smaller guns that could accompany a field army on the march, that when in combat could be moved about the battlefield in response to changing circumstances (field artillery), as opposed to guns installed in a fort (garrison artillery or coastal artillery), or to siege cannons and mortars which are too large to be moved quickly, and would be used only in a prolonged siege. Perhaps the most famous use of the field gun in terms of advanced tactics was Napoleon Bonaparte's use of very large wheels on the guns that allowed them to be moved quickly even during a battle. 

Pascal (unit)<====>66014<====>Pascal (unit)  The pascal (symbol: Pa) is the SI derived unit of pressure used to quantify internal pressure, stress, Young's modulus and ultimate tensile strength.  It is defined as one newton per square metre.   It is named after the French polymath Blaise Pascal. Common multiple units of the pascal are the hectopascal (1 hPa = 100 Pa) which is equal to one millibar, and the kilopascal (1 kPa = 1000 Pa) which is equal to one centibar. The unit of measurement called standard atmosphere (atm) is defined as  .Meteorological reports typically state atmospheric pressure in millibars. 

Pauline Phillips<====>66027<====>Pauline Phillips  Pauline Esther "Popo" Phillips  (née Friedman; July 4, 1918 – January 16, 2013), also known as Abigail Van Buren, was an American advice columnist and radio show host who began the Dear Abby column in 1956.  During her decades writing the column, it became the most widely syndicated newspaper column in the world, syndicated in 1,400 newspapers with 110 million readers.  From 1963 to 1975, Phillips also hosted a daily Dear Abby program on CBS Radio.  TV anchorwoman Diane Sawyer calls her the "pioneering queen of salty advice".  Early lifePauline Esther Friedman, nicknamed "Popo", was born in Sioux City, Iowa to Russian Jewish immigrants, Rebecca (née Rushall) and Abraham B. 

BBC Radiophonic Workshop<====>66028<====>BBC Radiophonic Workshop   The BBC Radiophonic Workshop was one of the sound effects units of the BBC, created in 1958 to produce incidental sounds and new music for radio and, later, television.  The unit is known for its experimental and pioneering work in electronic music and music technology, as well as its popular scores for programs such as Doctor Who and Quatermass and the Pit during the 1950s and '60s.The original Radiophonic Workshop was based in the BBC's Maida Vale Studios in Delaware Road, Maida Vale, London.   The Workshop was closed in March 1998,  although much of its traditional work had already been outsourced by 1995. 

Nicholas Lyndhurst<====>66037<====>Nicholas Lyndhurst   Nicholas Simon Lyndhurst (born 20 April 1961)    is an English actor.  He is known for playing Rodney Trotter in Only Fools and Horses, Gary Sparrow in Goodnight Sweetheart, Dan Griffin in the BBC drama New Tricks and Adam Parkinson in Carla Lane's series Butterflies.  Lyndhurst also prominently starred as Ashley Philips in The Two of Us, as Fletch's son Raymond in Going Straight, the sequel to the classic British sitcom Porridge, Jimmy Venables in After You've Gone, and Freddie 'The Frog' Robdal in the Only Fools and Horses prequel Rock & Chips. 

Breakbeat<====>66038<====>Breakbeat   Breakbeat is a broad style of electronic or dance-oriented music which utilizes breaks, often sampled from earlier recordings in funk, jazz, and R&B, for the main rhythm.  Breakbeats have been used in styles such as hip hop, jungle, drum and bass, hardcore, UK garage (including 2-step, breakstep and dubstep), and even pop and rock. Etymology The most likely origin of the word "breakbeat" is the fact that the drum loops that were sampled occurred during a "break" in the music, as in the Amen break, which is a drum solo from "Amen, Brother" by The Winstons. 

Intel 8008<====>66039<====>Intel 8008  The Intel 8008 ("eight-thousand-eight" or "eighty-oh-eight") is an early byte-oriented microprocessor designed and manufactured by Intel and introduced in April 1972.  It is an 8-bit CPU with an external 14-bit address bus that could address 16 KB of memory.  Originally known as the 1201, the chip was commissioned by Computer Terminal Corporation (CTC) to implement an instruction set of their design for their Datapoint 2200 programmable terminal.  As the chip was delayed and did not meet CTC's performance goals, the 2200 ended up using CTC's own TTL-based CPU instead.  An agreement permitted Intel to market the chip to other customers after Seiko expressed an interest in using it for a calculator. 

Communications Act of 1934<====>66040<====>Communications Act of 1934 The Communications Act of 1934 is a United States federal law, signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on June 19, 1934, and codified as Chapter 5 of Title 47 of the United States Code,   et seq. The Act replaced the Federal Radio Commission with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). It also transferred regulation of interstate telephone services from the Interstate Commerce Commission to the FCC.The first section of the Act reads: "For the purpose of regulating interstate and foreign commerce in communication by wire and radio so as to make available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United States a rapid, efficient, nationwide, and worldwide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges, for the purpose of the national defense, and for the purpose of securing a more effective execution of this policy by centralizing authority theretofore granted by law to several agencies and by granting additional authority with respect to interstate and foreign commerce in wire and radio communication, there is hereby created a commission to be known as the 'Federal Communications Commission', which shall be constituted as hereinafter provided, and which shall execute and enforce the provisions of this Act." Text of the Act, at criminalgovernment.com On January 3, 1996, the 104th Congress of the United States amended or repealed sections of the Communications Act of 1934 with the new Telecommunications Act of 1996. It was the first major overhaul of American telecommunications policy in nearly 62 years.HistoryThe Act largely combined and reorganized existing provisions of law, including provisions of the Federal Radio Act of 1927 relating to radio licensing, and of the Mann-Elkins Act of 1910 relating to telephone service.In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked Daniel C. Roper, Secretary of Commerce, to appoint an interdepartmental committee for studying electronic communications. The Committee reported that "the communications service, as far as congressional action is involved, should be regulated by a single body". A recommendation was made for the establishment of a new agency that would regulate all interstate and foreign communication by wire and radio, telegraphy, telephone and broadcast. On February 26, 1934, the President sent a special message to Congress urging the creation of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The following day Senator Clarence Dill and Representative Sam Rayburn introduced bills to carry out this recommendation. The Senate Bill (S.3285) passed the House on June 1, 1934, and the conference report was adopted by both houses eight days later. The Communications Act was signed by President Roosevelt on June 1934. Particular parts of it became effective July 1, 1934; the remaining parts on July 11, 1934. The Communications Act of 1934 followed the precedents of trial cases set under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3), regulating commerce "among the several states". Twenty years earlier, in 1914, the U.S. Supreme Court had set limits on price discrimination that were effectively interstate commerce in Houston, East & West Texas Railway Co. v. United States. The railway was setting lower prices for intrastate carriers within Texas while charging more for carriers that were going through or out of the state. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the ICC, and maximum prices were set to limit the damage that other states could face due to price discrimination.   Communications technology was determined to be an interstate good. President Franklin Roosevelt, along with lobbyists and state regulators, wanted communications technology, both wired and wireless, to be monitored in a similar way and influenced Congress to pass the Communications Act of 1934. The goal was to have telephone and broadcasting regulated with the same jurisdiction in a way similar to that in which the ICC regulates the railways and interstate commerce. The act did not, however, allow for price regulation through the FCC due to strong lobbying efforts from the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC). Currently there are some challenges and proposed changes to the Act. The company CellAntenna unsuccessfully sued  the FCC, claiming the Homeland Security Act of 2002 did override the Communications Act of 1934.  As the law stands today, the 1934 Communications Act prohibits local and state law enforcement from using jamming devices to thwart criminal and terrorist acts. CellAntenna lost its case, but as a response have supported legislation (The Safe Prisons Communications Act) sponsored by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and Representative Kevin Brady, attempting to amend the Communications Act of 1934. The bill was left in committee in the House. There has been public debate about the need for an Internet kill switch, defined in a proposed Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act.  This act removes the powers established in the 1934 Act and gives the President the authority to stop the Internet in case of a cyber attack.StructureThe Communications Act of 1934, as amended, consists of seven major sections or "titles": Title I: General ProvisionsTitle II: Common carrierTitle III: Provisions related to radioTitle IV: Procedural and administrative provisionsTitle V: Penal provisions; ForfeituresTitle VI: Cable communications (added by the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984)Title VII: Miscellaneous provisionsControversiesCommercial radio debateBefore the Communications Act of 1934 was enacted as law by the U.S. Congress, there was a debate over commercial versus non-commercial broadcasting: Senators Robert Wagner of New York and Henry Hatfield of West Virginia offered an amendment to the then proposed Communications Act. Educators wanted more of radio to be given to them; they had been termed a "special interest" by the Federal Radio Commission and their stations were forced to share frequencies. The Wagner-Hatfield amendment would have given 25% of all radio broadcasting facilities to non-profit institutions and organizations. It would also have allowed these educational stations to sell advertising in order to become self-sufficient. Senator Clarence Dill, a pro-industry spokesman, opposed this amendment. It would have meant eliminating numerous commercial stations, but that is not what Senator Dill publicly complained about. He expressed horror over the advertising. He said there was too much advertising already. Not all educators supported the advertising clause, so a compromise was struck. The issue was to be given to the new FCC to study and to hold hearings on and to report back to Congress. Hatfield and Wagner stuck to their guns, however, and proposed their amendment anyway. The Hatfield-Wagner amendment died and the Communications Act was passed.The Federal Communications Commission reported back, saying that commercial stations had ample time for educational and other public service programs. The Commission called for cooperation between commercial and educational interests and other non-profit groups. The educators lost, although commercial broadcasters were forced to air public affairs programs.Chain (network) caseThe U.S. Supreme Court held in National Broadcasting Co. Inc. et al. v. United States et al., 319 U.S. 190 on May 10, 1943, that the FCC had the right to issue regulations pertaining to associations between broadcasting networks and their affiliated stations. The opinion of the Supreme Court was not unanimous and it led to a conflict with an earlier decision in Federal Communications Commission v. Sanders Brothers Radio Station, 309 U.S. 470, on March 25, 1940.In that case the FCC interpreted Supreme Court decisions concerning broadcasting to mean that potential economic injury to an existing licensee was not grounds for refusing to license a competitor. (This FCC interpretation remained in place from 1940 to 1958.)The opinion of the Supreme Court was delivered by Felix Frankfurter. Justices Hugo Black and Wiley Blount Rutledge took no part in the discussion or decision. Justice Frank Murphy offered a dissenting opinion, stating that the Court was effectively giving the FCC a power to regulate networks which had not been given to the FCC by Congress. Murphy stated that Because the majority of the Court did not agree with Murphy, it effectively gave the FCC power to regulate the networks. As a result of this 1943 decision, NBC was forced to sell one of its two networks—the Blue Network—and it was this action which then led to the creation of the American Broadcasting Company.Federal Radio Commission v. Federal Communication CommissionThe FRC regulated radio communication only, but FCC covers any kind of wired and wireless communications. The FCC adopted the FRC's limited authority. The FRC could only regulate national radio communication and radio communication between ships,  but the FCC can control other mediums, both wired and wireless communication including radio, and has more concrete regulations. For example, Congress suspended section 315, equal time provision, for a TV forum on presidential election in 1960 because every candidate has to have same portion of time to speak. LegacyThe act established a legal basis for regulating wired and wireless communications on a nationwide and worldwide basis. The Federal Communication Commission was founded because of the act; it replaced the Federal Radio Commission. Because of the act, the U.S. government could regulate new media technologies such as television and mobile phones. Moreover, the act permitted the regulation of commercial communication corporations such as private radio and television companies. Opponents in Congress argued that the act harmed the telecommunications industry, such as by delaying the development of new technologies. In 1982 Congress produced a report recommending changes called "Proposals for Revision of the Communications Act of 1934: Telecommunications Issues". Creation of the Federal Communication CommissionThe Commerce Clause in Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the authority to regulate foreign and interstate commerce. By the early 20th century, radio transmission had become the most efficient way to facilitate communication about commerce and therefore, radio frequencies on the electromagnetic spectrum could constitutionally be regulated. The Wireless Ship Act of 1910 called for Congress to modestly regulate the wireless industry and the Radio Act of 1912 was their first attempt to make more legislative oversight to the entire radio industry. This Act required anyone who wanted to transmit over the radio to have government issued permission in form of a license. Along with the help of important legislators, these were the early building blocks that eventually evolved into the FCC.Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover played a large role regarding regulation because he issued the licenses which allocated the spectrum. Once radio broadcasting became popular, Hoover brought attention to the limited amount of frequency space the spectrum held. This problem made obtaining frequencies and airtime very difficult, as well as making "noise" on existing frequencies. Between 1923 and 1924, Hoover expanded the number of assigned frequencies to reduce the interference, but his quick fix failed, which, in turn, ended self-regulation of spectrum space. Congress then passed the Radio Act of 1927 to create the framework for regulating the rapidly-growing broadcast industry.President Calvin Coolidge was an important aspect of radio regulation by signing the Radio Act of 1927, which invested regulatory power to the Federal Radio Commission (FRC). Senators Clarence Dill and Wallace H. White, Jr. also pushed toward passing the 1927 Act. The FRC had a short, 6-year term in American history and transferred its responsibility, as the agency for managing the radio spectrum, to the FCC after the Communications Act of 1934. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the bill in 1934. This change in power was needed to develop a better way of determining who got to use what radio bands and for what purposes. There were many factors and individuals that played a role in the creation of the FCC, but in the end, Congress created the agency.  Transition from the Federal Radio CommissionThe FCC took over regulation in 1934 and changed many of the structural characteristics of the original agency, although its goal of reducing interference remained the same. The original FRC had 5 members who were each responsible for representing one geographical area of the United States. Congress also planned for the 5-member agency to become a quasi-judicial body which would only have to meet when necessary. Their jobs were to alleviate "noise" from the airwaves and they were given the power to license and regulate radio stations. The Federal Radio Commission's lack of regulatory action lead to the more permanent Federal Communication Commission. Much like the FRC, the FCC consists of commissioners who are appointed by the President and approved by the Senate. Each Commissioner can only serve for a five-year term, even the one chosen to be the Chairperson. Originally there were 7 commissioners with 7 year terms, but this was changed to 5 commissions with 5 year terms in 1986.   Though there are only five commissioners, there are several offices and departments, made up of hundreds and staff members that carry out different duties. For example, the Mass Media Bureau processes license applications and renewals. These divisions of administrative duties differentiate the FRC from the FCC.  Changes and amendmentsTelecommunications Act of 1996The Telecommunication Act 1996 and Communications Act of 1934 had two major changes: the new act was less technologically biased and offered less regulation.This act determined the basis of media regulation by its contents, not a technological standard. Title V in Telecommunication Act of 1996,  "Obscenity and Violence", is a good example of this; Title V set the standard for regulating media contents.The Communications Act of 1934 is argued by some to have created monopolies, such as the case of AT&T. The FCC recognized AT&T as a "natural monopoly" during the 1930s in the Communications Act of 1934.    Because of these effects, the FCC designed the Communications Act 1996 "to provide for a pro-competitive, de-regulatory national policy framework designed to accelerate rapidly private sector deployment of advanced information technologies and services to all Americans by opening all telecommunications markets to competition..."  The Telecommunication Act of 1996 also added and changed some rules to account for the emerging internet.The FCC derives its jurisdiction to facilitate the deployment of broadband to Americans in Section 706 in the Telecommunications act of 1996. In this section the code states that the FCC is to "encourage the deployment on a reasonable and timely basis of advanced telecommunications capability to all Americans."   They currently want to advocate the following objectives:Broaden the deployment of broadband technologiesDefine broadband to include any platform capable of transmitting high-bandwidth intensive servicesEnsure harmonized regulatory treatment of competing broadband servicesEncourage and facilitate an environment that stimulates investment and innovation in broadband technologies and services Technological biasesCommunications Act of 1934 is technologically biased because standards that determine regulation are technological properties:cable and radio, wire and wireless for instance.  It makes discriminations in same content on different medium. Phone lines were regulated to allow for emergency calls to be called whether the phones had service or not and the phone companies had to pay fees allowing their phones to connect to the 9-1-1 system. Many of these issues have been solved by adapting the rules to function with VoIP technologies. Being created at a time where there were only telephones and radio the act had very specific rules towards regulation in these markets. The act became biased as newer technologies entered the market with far less regulation.AmendmentsThe Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 added Title VI—Cable Communications, which deregulated the cable industry.The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 amended Title VI and required cable systems to carry most local broadcast channels and prohibited cable operators from charging local broadcasters to carry their signal.One major amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 was made on September 7, 1999. The FCC ruled "that a broadcast station should not be allowed to refuse a request for political advertising time solely on the ground that the station does not sell or program such lengths of time". Politics have had many effects and changes to the act that are not in the "best interest of the public" thus taking away some of the power given to the FCC from the Act. Proposed amendmentsThe Federal Communications Commission Consolidated Reporting Act of 2013 (H.R. 2844; 113th Congress) would amend the Communications Act of 1934 to require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to publish on its website and submit to Congress a biennial report on the state of the communications marketplace.That report would include an analysis of "the state of competition in the markets for voice, video, and data services, as well as the availability of high-speed and high-quality telecommunications services" in the United States. It would also "require the FCC to determine whether laws and regulations pose a barrier to entry into communications markets and to include that information in the biennial report" and cancel a number of preexisting requirements for various other reports from the FCC.

Comic science fiction<====>66047<====>Comic science fictionComic science fiction or comedy science fiction is a subgenre of soft science fiction or science fantasy that exploits the genre's conventions for comedic effect.   Comic science fiction often mocks or satirizes standard SF conventions like alien invasion of Earth, interstellar travel, or futuristic technology.  It can also satirize and criticize present-day society.  An early example was the Pete Manx series by Henry Kuttner and Arthur K.  Barnes (sometimes writing together and sometimes separately, under the house pen-name of Kelvin Kent).  Published in Thrilling Wonder Stories in the late 1930s and early 1940s, the series featured a time-traveling carnival barker who uses his con-man abilities to get out of trouble.

List of Norwegian monarchs<====>66051<====>List of Norwegian monarchsThe list of Norwegian monarchs (  or kongerekka) begins in 872: the traditional dating of the Battle of Hafrsfjord, after which victorious King Harald Fairhair merged several petty kingdoms into that of his father.  Named after the homonymous geographical region, Harald's realm was later to be known as the Kingdom of Norway. Traditionally established in 872 and existing continuously for over 1,100 years, the Kingdom of Norway is one of the original states of Europe: King Harald V, who has reigned since 1991, is the 64th monarch according to the official list.   During interregna, Norway has been ruled by variously titled regents. 

Harald Greycloak<====>66053<====>Harald GreycloakHarald II Greycloak (Old Norse: Haraldr gráfeldr, Norwegian: Harald Gråfell, Danish: Harald Gråfeld) (died 970) was a king of Norway.  Harald Greycloak was the son of Eirik Bloodaxe and a grandson of Harald Fairhair.  His mother was Gunnhild Gormsdatter, the sister of King Harald Bluetooth. After his father's death in 954, Harald and his brothers allied with their uncle, King Harald Gormson, against King Haakon I of Norway.  They fought several battles against King Haakon including the Battle of Rastarkalv near the island of Frei in 955 and the Battle of Fitjar in 961. After King Haakon's death at Fitjar, Harald and his brothers became kings of Norway, but they had little authority outside Western Norway. 

Harald Hardrada<====>66054<====>Harald Hardrada    Harald Sigurdsson ( ;   – 25 September 1066), given the epithet Hardrada ( , modern Norwegian Hardråde, roughly translated as "stern counsel" or "hard ruler") in the sagas , was King of Norway (as Harald III) from 1046 to 1066.  In addition, he unsuccessfully claimed the Danish throne until 1064 and the English throne in 1066.  Before becoming king, Harald had spent around fifteen years in exile as a mercenary and military commander in Kievan Rus' and of the Varangian Guard in the Byzantine Empire. When he was fifteen years old, in 1030, Harald fought in the Battle of Stiklestad together with his half-brother Olaf Haraldsson (later Saint Olaf). 

DuMont Television Network<====>66057<====>DuMont Television Network The DuMont Television Network (also known as the DuMont Network, simply DuMont/Du Mont, or (incorrectly) Dumont   ) was one of the world's pioneer commercial television networks, rivalling NBC and CBS for the distinction of being first overall in the United States.  It began operation in 1946.  Weinstein, David (2004).  The Forgotten Network: DuMont and the Birth of American Television, p.  16.  Philadelphia: Temple University Press.   .   It was owned by DuMont Laboratories, a television equipment and set manufacturer.  The network was hindered by the prohibitive cost of broadcasting, by regulations imposed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) which restricted the company's growth, and even by the company's partner, Paramount Pictures.

FM broadcasting in the United States<====>66059<====>FM broadcasting in the United States FM broadcasting in the United States began in the 1930s at engineer and inventor Edwin Howard Armstrong's experimental station, W2XMN.   The use of FM radio has been associated with higher sound quality in music radio. History of FM radio in the U. S.  In the United States FM radio stations broadcast at frequencies of 87. 9–107. 9 MHz.  FM radio was developed in the United States by Edwin Armstrong. During the 1930s, there were a small number  of experimental (known as "Apex") stations attempting to broadcast high fidelity audio using wide-bandwidth AM on VHF frequencies. 

American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers<====>66064<====>American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers    The American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP  ) is an American not-for-profit performance-rights organization (PRO) that protects its members' musical copyrights by monitoring public performances of their music, whether via a broadcast or live performance, and compensating them accordingly.  ASCAP collects licensing fees from users of music created by ASCAP members, then distributes them back to its members as royalties.  In effect, the arrangement is the product of a compromise: when a song is played, the user does not have to pay the copyright holder directly, nor does the music creator have to bill a radio station for use of a song.

Harald Gille<====>66067<====>Harald Gille Harald Gille (Old Norse: Haraldr gilli or Haraldr gillikristr, died 14 December 1136) was king of Norway from 1130 until his death.  His byname Gille is probably from Middle Irish Gilla Críst "servant of Christ". BackgroundHarald was born ca.  1102 in Ireland or the Hebrides, more likely the former.  According to the sagas, he became familiar with Norway through an acquaintance with Norwegian merchants including Rögnvald Kali Kolsson, who would later become Earl of Orkney.  Around 1127, Harald went to Norway and declared he was an illegitimate son of the former king, Magnus Barefoot, who had visited Ireland just before his death in 1103.

Farscape<====>66070<====>Farscape    Farscape is an Australian-American science fiction television series, produced originally for the Nine Network.  The series was conceived by Rockne S.  O'Bannon and produced by The Jim Henson Company and Hallmark Entertainment.The Jim Henson Company was responsible for the various alien make-up and prosthetics, and two regular characters (the animatronic puppets Rygel and Pilot) are entirely Creature Shop creations. Although the series was planned for five seasons, it was abruptly cancelled after production had ended on its fourth season, ending the series on a cliffhanger.  Co-producer Brian Henson later secured the rights to Farscape, paving the way for a three-hour miniseries to wrap up the cliffhanger, titled Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars, which Henson directed. 

Art museum<====>66076<====>Art museum An art museum or art gallery is a building or space for the exhibition of art, usually visual art. Museums can be public or private, but what distinguishes a museum is the ownership of a collection.  Paintings are the most commonly displayed art objects; however, sculptures, decorative arts, furniture, textiles, costumes, drawings, pastels, watercolors, collages, prints, artist's books, photographs, and installation art are also regularly shown.    Although primarily concerned with providing a space to show works of visual art, art galleries are sometimes used to host other artistic activities, such as performance arts, music concerts, or poetry readings.

Shopping<====>66080<====>Shopping  A retailer or a shop is a business that presents a selection of goods and offers to trade or sell them to customers for money or other goods.  Shopping is an activity in which a customer browses the available goods or services presented by one or more retailers with the intent to purchase a suitable selection of them.  In some contexts it may be considered a leisure activity as well as an economic one. In modern days customer focus is more transferred towards online shopping; worldwide people order products from different regions and online retailers deliver their products to their homes, offices or wherever they want.

Pétain, who was 84 years old in 1940, ranks as France's oldest head of state.  Today, he is considered by many the French equivalent to his contemporary Vidkun Quisling in Norway. 

DR-DOS<====>66086<====>DR-DOS  DR-DOS (DR DOS, without hyphen up to and including version 6. 0) is an operating system of the DOS family, written for IBM PC-compatible personal computers.  It was originally developed by Gary Kildall's Digital Research and derived from Concurrent PC DOS 6. 0, which was an advanced successor of CP/M-86.  As ownership changed, various later versions were produced with names including Novell DOS and Caldera OpenDOS. HistoryOrigins in CP/MDigital Research's original CP/M for the 8-bit Intel 8080 and Z-80 based systems spawned numerous spin-off versions, most notably CP/M-86 for the Intel 8086/8088 family of processors.  Although CP/M had dominated the market, and was shipped with the vast majority of non-proprietary-architecture personal computers, the IBM PC in 1981 brought the beginning of what was eventually to be a massive change. 

Art colony<====>66098<====>Art colony   near Melbourne, Australia. ]]An art colony or artists' colony is a place where creative practitioners live and interact with one another.  Artists are often invited or selected through a formal process, for a residency from a few weeks to over a year.  Beginning with the early 20th century models, such as MacDowell Colony and Yaddo, hundreds of modern-day artist colonies now offer the benefit of time, space, and collaborative time away from the usual workaday world.  Worldwide, the two primary organizations serving artist colonies and residential centres are Res Artis, based in Amsterdam, and the Alliance of Artists Communities, based in Providence, Rhode Island.

Eclipse cycle<====>66109<====>Eclipse cycleEclipses may occur repeatedly, separated by certain intervals of time: these intervals are called eclipse cycles.    The series of eclipses separated by a repeat of one of these intervals is called an eclipse series. Eclipse conditionsEclipses may occur when the Earth and the Moon are aligned with the Sun, and the shadow of one body cast by the Sun falls on the other.   So at new moon, when the Moon is in conjunction with the Sun, the Moon may pass in front of the Sun as seen from a narrow region on the surface of the Earth and cause a solar eclipse. 

Saros (astronomy)<====>66111<====>Saros (astronomy)The Saros ( ) is a period of approximately 223 synodic months (approximately 6585. 3211 days, or 18 years, 11 days, 8 hours),  that can be used to predict eclipses of the Sun and Moon.  One saros period after an eclipse, the Sun, Earth, and Moon return to approximately the same relative geometry, a near straight line, and a nearly identical eclipse will occur, in what is referred to as an eclipse cycle.  A sar is one half of a saros.  A series of eclipses that are separated by one saros is called a saros series.

List of rulers of China<====>66142<====>List of rulers of China The list of rulers of China includes rulers of China with various titles.  From the Zhou dynasty to the Qin dynasty, rulers usually held the title "king" ( ).  With the separation of China into different Warring States, this title had become so common that the unifier of China, the first Qin Emperor Qin Shihuang created a new title for himself, that of "emperor" ( ).  The title of emperor of China continued to be used for the remainder of China's imperial history, right down to the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912.

Eric Bloodaxe<====>66145<====>Eric Bloodaxe   Eric Haraldsson (Old Norse: Eiríkr Haraldsson,  ; c.  885 – 954), nicknamed Eric Bloodaxe (Old Norse: Eiríkr blóðøx,  ), was a 10th-century Norwegian ruler.  He is thought to have had short-lived terms as King of Norway and twice as King of Northumbria (c.  947–948 and 952–954).  SourcesHistorians have reconstructed a narrative of Eric's life and career from the scant available historical data.  There is a distinction between contemporary or near contemporary sources for Eric's period as ruler of Northumbria, and the entirely saga-based sources that detail the life of Eric of Norway, a chieftain who ruled the Norwegian Westland in the 930s. 

Haakon the Good<====>66148<====>Haakon the Good  Haakon Haraldsson (c.  920–961), also Haakon the Good (Old Norse: Hákon góði, Norwegian: Håkon den gode) and Haakon Adalsteinfostre (Old Norse: Hákon Aðalsteinsfóstri, Norwegian: Håkon Adalsteinsfostre), was the king of Norway from 934 to 961.  He was noted for his attempts to introduce Christianity into Norway.    Early lifeHaakon is not mentioned in any narrative sources earlier than the late 12th century.  According to this late saga tradition, Haakon was the youngest son of King Harald Fairhair and Thora Mosterstang.  He was born on the Håkonshella peninsula in Hordaland.  King Harald determined to remove his youngest son out of harm's way and accordingly sent him to the court of King Athelstan of England. 

Sea urchin<====>66152<====>Sea urchin  Sea urchins or urchins ( ), archaically called sea hedgehogs,    are spiny, globular animals in the class Echinoidea.  About 950 species of echinoidid inhabit all oceans from the intertidal to   deep. The test of the sea urchins is round and spiny, typically from   across.  Common colors include black and dull shades of green, olive, brown, purple, blue, and red.  Sea urchins move slowly, feeding primarily on algae.  Sea otters, starfish, wolf eels, triggerfish, and other predators hunt and feed on sea urchins. 

Festival of Britain<====>66154<====>Festival of Britain  The Festival of Britain was a national exhibition and fair that reached millions of visitors throughout the United Kingdom in the summer of 1951.  Historian Kenneth O.  Morgan says the Festival was a "triumphant success" as people:flocked to the South Bank site, to wander around the Dome of Discovery, gaze at the Skylon, and generally enjoy a festival of national celebration.  Up and down the land, lesser festivals enlisted much civic and voluntary enthusiasm.  A people curbed by years of total war and half-crushed by austerity and gloom,  showed that it had not lost the capacity for enjoying itself. 

Alfalfa<====>66159<====>Alfalfa    Alfalfa  , Medicago sativa also called lucerne, is a perennial flowering plant in the pea family Fabaceae cultivated as an important forage crop in many countries around the world.  It is used for grazing, hay, and silage, as well as a green manure and cover crop.  The name alfalfa is used in North America.  The name lucerne is the more commonly used name in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.  The plant superficially resembles clover (a cousin in the same family), especially while young, when trifoliate leaves comprising round leaflets predominate. 

Marie-José Pérec<====>66161<====>Marie-José Pérec  Marie-José Pérec (born 9 May 1968) is a retired French track and field sprinter who specialised in the 200 and 400 metres and was a three-time Olympic gold medalist. Athletics careerPérec won the 1991 World Championships 400 metres title in Tokyo and repeated the feat at the 1995 World Championships in Gothenburg.   She was the 400 metres champion at the 1992 Olympics Games in Barcelona.  Four years later, she entered the 200 metres and 400 metres events at the 1996 Olympics Games in Atlanta and won both, thus achieving the second-ever Olympic 200 metres/400 metres gold medal double (the first was achieved by Valerie Brisco-Hooks in Los Angeles in 1984).

University constituency<====>66167<====>University constituency   A university constituency is a constituency, used in elections to a legislature, that represents the members of one or more universities rather than residents of a geographical area.  University constituencies may or may not involve plural voting, in which some voters are eligible to vote in both a university constituency and a geographical constituency. University constituencies originated in Scotland, where the representatives of the ancient universities of Scotland sat in the unicameral Estates of Parliament.   When James VI inherited the English throne in 1603, the system was adopted by the Parliament of England. 

Kent Pitman<====>66170<====>Kent Pitman  Kent M.  Pitman is the President of HyperMeta, Inc.  and has been involved for many years in the design, implementation and use of Lisp and Scheme systems.  He is sometimes known by his initials KMP.  Kent Pitman is the author of the Common Lisp Condition System   as well as of numerous papers on Lisp programming and computer programming in general. While in high school, he saw output from one of the "guess the animal" pseudo-artificial intelligence games then popular.  He considered implementing a version of the program in BASIC, but once at MIT, he instead implemented it in several dialects of Lisp, including Maclisp. 

Stephen F. Austin<====>66171<====>Stephen F.  Austin    Stephen Fuller Austin (November 3, 1793 – December 27, 1836) was an American empresario.  Known as the "Father of Texas", and the founder of Texas,  he led the second, and ultimately, the successful colonization of the region by bringing 300 families from the United States to the region in 1825.

His father, Moses Austin, received an empresario grant from Spain to settle Texas. 

Common swift<====>66173<====>Common swift  The common swift (Apus apus) is a medium-sized bird, superficially similar to the barn swallow or house martin but somewhat larger, though not stemming from those passerine species, being in the order Apodiformes.  The resemblances between the groups are due to convergent evolution, reflecting similar contextual development.  The swifts' nearest relatives are thought  to be the New World hummingbirds and the Southeast Asian treeswifts. Its scientific name Apus is Latin for a swift, thought by the ancients to be a type of swallow with no feet (from Ancient Greek α, a, "without", and πούς, pous, "foot"). 

Barn swallow<====>66174<====>Barn swallow  The barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) is the most widespread species of swallow in the world.   It is a distinctive passerine bird with blue upperparts, a long, deeply forked tail and curved, pointed wings.  It is found in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas.    p164–169  In Anglophone Europe it is just called the swallow; in Northern Europe it is the only common species called a "swallow" rather than a "martin".  See Gill, Frank, and Wright, Minturn, Birds of the World: Recommended English Names (Princeton 2006),   There are six subspecies of barn swallow, which breed across the Northern Hemisphere. 

Realpolitik<====>66178<====>Realpolitik Realpolitik (from   "realistic", "practical", or "actual"; and   "politics",  ) is politics or diplomacy based primarily on considerations of given circumstances and factors, rather than explicit ideological notions or moral and ethical premises.  In this respect, it shares aspects of its philosophical approach with those of realism and pragmatism.  It is often simply referred to as pragmatism in politics, e. g.  "pursuing pragmatic policies".  The term Realpolitik is sometimes used pejoratively to imply politics that are perceived as coercive, amoral, or Machiavellian.  Realpolitik is often confused with the philosophy of political realism. 

Dreyfus affair<====>66179<====>Dreyfus affair    The Dreyfus Affair ( ,  ) was a political scandal that divided the Third French Republic from 1894 until its resolution in 1906.  The affair is often seen as a modern and universal symbol of injustice,  and it remains one of the most notable examples of a complex miscarriage of justice.  The major role played by the press and public opinion proved influential in the lasting social conflict. The scandal began in December 1894 with the treason conviction of Captain Alfred Dreyfus, a young French artillery officer of Alsatian and Jewish descent. 

Role-based access control<====>66181<====>Role-based access control In computer systems security, role-based access control (RBAC)   is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users.  It is used by the majority of enterprises with more than 500 employees,    and can implement mandatory access control (MAC) or discretionary access control (DAC).  RBAC is sometimes referred to as role-based security. Role-based-access-control (RBAC) is a policy neutral access control mechanism defined around roles and privileges.   The components of RBAC such as role-permissions, user-role and role-role relationships make it simple to perform user assignments.  A study by NIST has demonstrated that RBAC addresses many needs of commercial and government organizations. 

National Palace Museum<====>66184<====>National Palace Museum   The National Palace Museum,  located in Taipei and Taibao, Taiwan, has a permanent collection of nearly 700,000 pieces of ancient Chinese imperial artifacts and artworks, making it one of the largest of its type in the world.  The collection encompasses 8,000 years of history of Chinese art from the Neolithic age to the modern.Most of the collection are high quality pieces collected by China's emperors.  The National Palace Museum shares its roots with the Palace Museum in the Forbidden City, whose extensive collection of artwork and artifacts were built upon the imperial collections of the Ming and Qing dynasties. 

Vinland map<====>66185<====>Vinland mapThe Vinland map is claimed to be a 15th-century mappa mundi with unique information about Norse exploration of North America.  It is very well known because of the publicity campaign which accompanied its revelation to the public as a "genuine" pre-Columbian map in 1965.  In addition to showing Africa, Asia and Europe, the map depicts a landmass south-west of Greenland in the Atlantic labelled as Vinland (Vinlanda Insula). The map describes this region as having been visited by Europeans in the 11th century.  Although it was presented to the world in 1965 with an accompanying scholarly book written by British Museum and Yale University librarians,    historians of geography and medieval document specialists began to suspect that it might be a fake as soon as photographs of it became available,    and chemical analyses have identified one of the major ink ingredients as a 20th-century artificial pigment. 

Bastille<====>66186<====>Bastille  The Bastille ( ;  ) was a fortress in Paris, known formally as the Bastille Saint-Antoine.  It played an important role in the internal conflicts of France and for most of its history was used as a state prison by the kings of France.  It was stormed by a crowd on 14 July 1789, in the French Revolution, becoming an important symbol for the French Republican movement, and was later demolished and replaced by the Place de la Bastille. The Bastille was built to defend the eastern approach to the city of Paris from the English threat in the Hundred Years' War. 

Mesomeric effect<====>66189<====>Mesomeric effect The mesomeric effect in chemistry is a property of substituents or functional groups in a chemical compound.  The effect is used in a qualitative way and describes the electron withdrawing or releasing properties of substituents based on relevant resonance structures and is symbolized by the letter M.  The mesomeric effect is negative (–M) when the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group and the effect is positive (+M) when the substituent is an electron releasing group. +M EFFECT ORDER–O −  > –NH 2  > –NHR > –OR > –NHCOR > –OCOR > –Ph > –F > –Cl > –Br > –I-M EFFECT ORDER–NO 2  > –CN > --S(=O)2−OH > –CHO > –C=O > –COOCOR > –COOR > –COOH > –CONH 2  > –COO − The net electron flow from or to the substituent is determined also by the inductive effect. 

Fourth Geneva Convention<====>66191<====>Fourth Geneva Convention The Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, commonly referred to as the Fourth Geneva Convention and abbreviated as GCIV, is one of the four treaties of the Geneva Conventions.  It was adopted in August 1949.  While the first three conventions dealt with combatants, the Fourth Geneva Convention was the first to deal with humanitarian protections for civilians in a war zone.  There are currently 196 countries party to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, including this and the other three treaties.  In 1993, the United Nations Security Council adopted a report from the Secretary-General and a Commission of Experts which concluded that the Geneva Conventions had passed into the body of customary international law, thus making them binding on non-signatories to the Conventions whenever they engage in armed conflicts. 

Copyhold<====>66192<====>Copyhold  Copyhold tenure was a form of customary tenure of land common in England from the Middle Ages.  The land was held according to the custom of the manor, and the mode of landholding took its name from the fact that the "title deed" received by the tenant was a copy of the relevant entry in the manorial court roll.  A tenant who held land in this way was known as a copyholder. PrinciplesThe privileges granted to each tenant, and the exact services he was to render to the Lord of the Manor in return for them, were described in the roll or book kept by the Steward, who gave a copy of the relevant entry to the tenant. 

Prefix code<====>66193<====>Prefix codeA prefix code is a type of code system (typically a variable-length code) distinguished by its possession of the "prefix property", which requires that there is no whole code word in the system that is a prefix (initial segment) of any other code word in the system.  For example, a code with code words {9, 55} has the prefix property; a code consisting of {9, 5, 59, 55} does not, because "5" is a prefix of "59" and also of "55".  A prefix code is a uniquely decodable code: given a complete and accurate sequence, a receiver can identify each word without requiring a special marker between words. 

Rapture<====>66196<====>Rapture   The Rapture is an eschatological term used by certain Christians, particularly within branches of American Evangelicalism, referring to a purported end time event when all elect Christian believers—living and resurrected dead— will rise into the sky and join Christ for eternity.   Some adherents believe this event is predicted and described in Paul's First Epistle to the Thessalonians in the Bible,  where he uses the Greek "harpazo" (ἁρπάζω), meaning to snatch away or seize.   Though it has been used differently in the past, the term is now often used by certain believers to distinguish this particular event from the "Second Coming" of Jesus Christ to Earth mentioned in Second Thessalonians, Gospel of Matthew, First Corinthians, and Revelation, usually viewing it as preceding the Second Coming and followed by a thousand year millennial kingdom. 

Osip Mandelstam<====>66199<====>Osip Mandelstam Osip Emilyevich Mandelshtam  ( ;   – 27 December 1938) was a Russian poet and essayist.  He was the husband of Nadezhda Mandelshtam and one of the foremost members of the Acmeist school of poets.  He was arrested by Joseph Stalin's government during the repression of the 1930s and sent into internal exile with his wife Nadezhda.  Given a reprieve of sorts, they moved to Voronezh in southwestern Russia.  In 1938 Mandelstam was arrested again and sentenced to a camp in Siberia.  He died that year at a transit camp. Life and workMandelshtam was born in Warsaw (then part of the Russian Empire) to a wealthy Polish-Jewish family. 

Exquisite corpse<====>66200<====>Exquisite corpse  Exquisite corpse, also known as exquisite cadaver (from the original French term  ), is a method by which a collection of words or images is collectively assembled.  Each collaborator adds to a composition in sequence, either by following a rule (e. g.  "The adjective noun adverb verb the adjective noun. " as in "The green duck sweetly sang the dreadful dirge. ") or by being allowed to see only the end of what the previous person contributed. HistoryThe technique was invented by surrealists and is similar to an old parlour game called consequences in which players write in turn on a sheet of paper, fold it to conceal part of the writing, and then pass it to the next player for a further contribution. 

Dragon (Middle-earth)<====>66202<====>Dragon (Middle-earth)  J.  R.  R.  Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium features dragons closely based on those of European legend. Besides dragon (derived from French), Tolkien variously used the terms drake (the original English term, from Old English draca, in turn from Latin draco and Greek δράκων) and worm (from Old English wyrm, "serpent", "dragon").  History The dragons were bred by Morgoth during the First Age, when Glaurung, the first dragon, appears.  Tolkien's dragons are capable of breeding on their own, and in later ages the Withered Heath is purportedly their spawning ground. InspirationThe Dragons were inspired by Fafnir from Germanic mythology, The Dragon from Beowulf, the Dragon from the legend of Saint George and the Dragon. 

Chinese dragon<====>66203<====>Chinese dragon  Chinese dragons are legendary creatures in Chinese mythology and Chinese folklore.  The dragons have many animal-like forms such as turtles and fish, but are most commonly depicted as snake-like with four legs.  Chinese dragons traditionally symbolize potent and   powers, particularly control over water, rainfall, typhoons, and floods.  The dragon is also a symbol of power, strength, and good luck for people who are worthy of it.  With this, the Emperor of China usually used the dragon as a symbol of his imperial power and strength.  In Chinese daily language, excellent and outstanding people are compared to a dragon, while incapable people with no achievements are compared with other, disesteemed creatures, such as a worm.

Night Gallery<====>66215<====>Night Gallery   Night Gallery is an American anthology series that aired on NBC from 1969 to 1973, featuring stories of horror and the macabre.  Rod Serling, who had gained fame from an earlier series, The Twilight Zone, served both as the on-air host of Night Gallery and as a major contributor of scripts, although he did not have the same control of content and tone as he had on The Twilight Zone. Serling viewed Night Gallery as a logical extension of The Twilight Zone, but while both series shared an interest in thought-provoking dark fantasy, more of Zone s offerings were science fiction while Night Gallery focused on horrors of the supernatural. 

Anagrams<====>66217<====>Anagrams  Anagrams (also known as Pirate Scrabble, Anagram, Snatch, Word Making and Taking and Grabscrab) is a tile-based word game that involves rearranging letter tiles to form words. The game pieces consist of a set of tiles with letters on them.  Tiles are turned over one by one, and players form words by combining unused tiles with existing words, their own or others'.  The game has never been standardized and there exist a great many varieties of sets and rules.  Anagrams is now often played with tiles from another word game, such as Scrabble.  Web and mobile app based versions of this game have also been created. 

Love and Mr Lewisham<====>66219<====>Love and Mr Lewisham Love and Mr Lewisham (subtitled  "The Story of a Very Young Couple") is a 1900 novel set in the 1880s by H.  G.  Wells.

Curtis LeMay<====>66225<====>Curtis LeMay Curtis Emerson LeMay (November 15, 1906 – October 1, 1990) was a general in the United States Air Force and the vice presidential running mate of American Independent Party candidate George Wallace in the 1968 presidential election.  LeMay is credited with designing and implementing an effective, but also controversial, systematic strategic bombing campaign in the Pacific theater of World War II.  He served as Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force from 1961 to 1965. LeMay joined the United States Army Air Corps while studying civil engineering at Ohio State University.  He had risen to the rank of major by the time of the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor. 

Fredrikstad<====>66228<====>Fredrikstad    Fredrikstad ( ; previously Frederiksstad; literally Fredrik's Town) is a city and municipality in Østfold county, Norway.  The administrative centre of the municipality is the city of Fredrikstad. The city of Fredrikstad was founded in 1567 by King Frederick II, and established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt).  The rural municipality of Glemmen was merged with Fredrikstad on 1 January 1964.  The rural municipalities of Borge, Onsøy, Kråkerøy, and Rolvsøy were merged with Fredrikstad on 1 January 1994. The city straddles the river Glomma where it meets the Skagerrak.  Along with neighboring Sarpsborg, Fredrikstad forms the fifth largest city in Norway: Fredrikstad/Sarpsborg. 

Peshawar<====>66230<====>PeshawarPeshawar (   ;    ;  ) is the capital of the Pakistani province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.It also serves as the administrative centre and economic hub for the Federally Administered Tribal Areas.    Situated in a broad valley near the eastern end of the historic Khyber Pass, close to the border with Afghanistan, Peshawar's recorded history dates back to at least 539 BCE, making it the oldest city in Pakistan and one of the oldest in South Asia.   Peshawar was the capital of the ancient Kushan Empire, and was home to what may have been the tallest building in the ancient world, the Kanishka stupa. 

Home Army<====>66231<====>Home Army    The Home Army ( ;  , abbreviated AK) was the dominant Polish resistance movement in Poland occupied by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union during World War II.   It was formed in February 1942 from the Związek Walki Zbrojnej (Armed Resistance).   Over the next two years, it absorbed most other Polish underground forces.   Its allegiance was to the Polish Government-in-Exile, and it constituted the armed wing of what became known as the "Polish Underground State". Estimates of the Home Army's 1944 strength range between 200,000 and 600,000, the most commonly cited number being 400,000.

Capehart  Homer Earl Capehart (June 6, 1897 – September 3, 1979) was an American businessman and politician from Indiana.After serving in the United States Army during World War I, he became involved in the manufacture of record players and other products, Capehart later served 18 years   in the U. S.  Senate as a Republican from Indiana.  Initially an isolationist on foreign policy, he took a more internationalist stance in later years; he retired after a narrow defeat for a fourth term in 1962. Early lifeThe son of a tenant farmer, Capehart was born in Algiers, Indiana, in Pike County. 

James Eastland<====>66238<====>James Eastland James Oliver Eastland (November 28, 1904  February 19, 1986) was an American politician from Mississippi who served in the United States Senate as a Democrat in 1941; and again from 1943 until his resignation on December 27, 1978.  From 1947 to 1978, he served alongside John C.  Stennis, also a Democrat.  At the time, Eastland and Stennis were the longest-serving Senate duo in American history, though their record was subsequently surpassed by Strom Thurmond and Ernest Hollings of South Carolina, who served together for thirty-six years.  Eastland was also the most senior member of the Senate at the time of his retirement in 1978. 

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow<====>66240<====>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow  Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (February 27, 1807 – March 24, 1882) was an American poet and educator whose works include "Paul Revere's Ride", The Song of Hiawatha, and Evangeline.  He was also the first American to translate Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, and was one of the five Fireside Poets from New England. Longfellow was born in Portland, Maine, which was then still part of Massachusetts.  He studied at Bowdoin College.  After spending time in Europe, he became a professor at Bowdoin and, later, at Harvard College.  His first major poetry collections were Voices of the Night (1839) and Ballads and Other Poems (1841). 

Transparency International<====>66241<====>Transparency International  Transparency International e. V.  (TI) is an international non-governmental organization which is based in Berlin, Germany, and was founded in 1993.  Its nonprofit purpose is to take action to combat global  corruption and prevent criminal activities arising from corruption.  It publishes for example the Global Corruption Barometer and the Corruption Perceptions Index.  Transparency International has the legal status of a German registered voluntary association (Eingetragener Verein) and serves as an umbrella organization.  Its members have grown from a few individuals to more than 100 national chapters which engage in fighting corruption in their home countries. 

Victor Gollancz<====>66243<====>Victor Gollancz  Sir Victor Gollancz ( ; 9 April 1893 – 8 February 1967) was a British publisher and humanitarian. Gollancz was often noted as a supporter of left-wing causes.  His loyalties shifted between Liberalism and Communism, but he defined himself as a Christian Socialist and Internationalist.  Although he gained high credibility by forecasting the Nazi extermination of Jews, he campaigned for friendship with both Germany and Soviet Russia.  He used his publishing house chiefly to promote pacifist and socialist non-fiction, and also launched the Left Book Club. In the postwar era, he focused his attention on Germany and became noted for his promotion of friendship and reconciliation based on his internationalism and his ethic of brotherly love.

Ladder logic<====>66251<====>Ladder logic  Ladder logic was originally a written method to document the design and construction of relay racks as used in manufacturing and process control.   Each device in the relay rack would be represented by a symbol on the ladder diagram with connections between those devices shown.  In addition, other items external to the relay rack such as pumps, heaters, and so forth would also be shown on the ladder diagram.  See relay logic. Ladder logic has evolved into a programming language that represents a program by a graphical diagram based on the circuit diagrams of relay logic hardware. 

Spin (propaganda)<====>66252<====>Spin (propaganda) In public relations and politics, spin is a form of propaganda, achieved through providing a biased interpretation of an event or campaigning to persuade public opinion in favor or against some organization or public figure.  While traditional public relations and advertising may also rely on altering the presentation of the facts, "spin" often implies the use of disingenuous, deceptive, and highly manipulative tactics.   Because of the frequent association between spin and press conferences (especially government press conferences), the room in which these conferences take place is sometimes described as a "spin room".   Public relations advisors, pollsters and media consultants who develop deceptive or misleading messages may be referred to as "spin doctors" or "spinmeisters". 

Drinking<====>66254<====>Drinking Drinking is the act of ingesting water or other liquids into the body through the mouth.  Water is required for many of life’s physiological processes.  Both excessive and inadequate water intake are associated with health problems. MethodsIn humansWhen a liquid is poured into an open human mouth, the swallowing process is completed by peristalsis which delivers the liquid to the stomach; much of the activity is abetted by gravity.  The liquid may be poured from the hands or drinkware may be used as vessels.  Drinking can also be performed by acts of inhalation, typically when imbibing hot liquids or drinking from a spoon. 

Bzip2<====>66255<====>Bzip2    bzip2 is a free and open-source file compression program that uses the Burrows–Wheeler algorithm.  It only compresses single files and is not a file archiver.  It is developed and maintained by Julian Seward.  Seward made the first public release of bzip2, version 0. 15, in July 1996.  The compressor's stability and popularity grew over the next several years, and Seward released version 1. 0 in late 2000.  Compression efficiencybzip2 compresses most files more effectively than the older LZW (. Z) and Deflate (. zip and . gz) compression algorithms, but is considerably slower. 

PID controller<====>66256<====>PID controllerA proportional–integral–derivative controller  (PID controller or three term controller) is a control loop feedback mechanism widely used in industrial control systems and a variety of other applications requiring continuously modulated control.  A PID controller continuously calculates an error value  e(t)  as the difference between a desired setpoint (SP) and a measured process variable (PV) and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms (denoted P, I, and D respectively) which give the controller its name. In practical terms it automatically applies accurate and responsive correction to a control function.  An everyday example is the cruise control on a road vehicle; where external influences such as gradients would cause speed changes, and the driver has the ability to alter the desired set speed. 

Almdudler<====>66258<====>Almdudler Almdudler ( ) is the brand name of a popular carbonated soft drink from Austria.  ProductThe original Almdudler is a sweetened carbonated beverage made of herbal extracts.  Almdudler has been called the "national drink of Austria".   Its popularity in Austria is second only to Coca-Cola.  About 80 million litres of the beverage are produced per year. Almdudler is currently sold in original, light (sugar-free), "still" (uncarbonated), and g'spritzt (mixed with carbonated mineral water) versions.  In Austria, a Radler variety (mixed with beer), is available as Almradler.  In the wine-growing regions of Lower Austria and Burgenland, it is a popular mixer with locally produced red and white wines. 

Hexose<====>66264<====>HexoseIn bio-organic chemistry, a hexose is a monosaccharide with six carbon atoms, having the chemical formula C 6 H 12 O 6 .  Hexoses are classified by functional group, with aldohexoses having an aldehyde at position 1, and ketohexoses having a ketone at position 2. AldohexosesThe aldohexoses have four chiral centres for a total of 16 possible aldohexose stereoisomers (2 4 ).  The  D / L  configuration is based on the orientation of the hydroxyl at position 5, and does not refer to the direction of optical activity. The eight  D -aldohexoses are: File:DAllose Fischer. 

Mark Spitz<====>66265<====>Mark Spitz   Mark Andrew Spitz (born February 10, 1950) is an American former competitive swimmer, nine-time Olympic champion, and former world record-holder in 7 events.   He won seven gold medals at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany, an achievement surpassed only by Michael Phelps, who won eight golds at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.  Spitz set new world records in all seven events in which he competed in 1972.  Spitz holds more medals than any other Jewish athlete in the history of the Olympics.  Between 1968 and 1972, Spitz won nine Olympic golds, a silver, and a bronze; five Pan American golds; 31 Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) titles; and eight National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) titles. 

Homesteading the Noosphere<====>66267<====>Homesteading the Noosphere"Homesteading the Noosphere" (abbreviated HtN) is an essay written by Eric S.  Raymond about the social workings of open-source software development.  It follows his previous piece "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" (1997). The essay examines issues of project ownership and transfer, as well as investigating possible anthropological roots of the gift culture in open source as contrasted with the exchange culture of closed source software.  Raymond also investigates the nature of the spread of open source into the untamed frontier of ideas he terms the noosphere, postulating that projects that range too far ahead of their time fail because they are too far out in the wilderness, and that successful projects tend to relate to existing projects. 

Chloride<====>66269<====>Chloride  The chloride ion    is the anion (negatively charged ion) Cl − .  It is formed when the element chlorine (a halogen) gains an electron or when a compound such as hydrogen chloride is dissolved in water or other polar solvents.  Chloride salts such as sodium chloride are often very soluble in water.   It is an essential electrolyte located in all body fluids responsible for maintaining acid/base balance, transmitting nerve impulses and regulating fluid in and out of cells.  Less frequently, the word chloride may also form part of the "common" name of chemical compounds in which one or more chlorine atoms are covalently bonded. 

Greg Louganis<====>66270<====>Greg Louganis Gregory Efthimios "Greg" Louganis ( ; born January 29, 1960) is an American Olympic diver, LGBT activist, and author who won gold medals at the 1984 and 1988 Summer Olympics, on both the springboard and platform.  He is the only male and the second diver in Olympic history to sweep the diving events in consecutive Olympic Games.  He has been called both "the greatest American diver"    and "probably the greatest diver in history".    Early lifeLouganis was born in El Cajon, California, and is of Samoan and Swedish descent.  His teenage biological parents placed him for adoption when he was eight months old and he was raised in California by his adoptive parents, Frances and Peter Louganis. 

Olaf II of Denmark<====>66273<====>Olaf II of Denmark  Olaf II Haakonsson (1370 – 23 August 1387) was King of Denmark as Olaf II (1376–1387) and King of Norway as Olaf IV (1380–1387).   Olaf was son of King Haakon VI of Norway and the grandson of King Magnus IV of Sweden.  His mother was Queen Margaret I of Denmark which made him the grandson of King Valdemar IV of Denmark.  In addition to his claim on the thrones of Denmark and later Norway, he was in the direct succession line to the throne of Sweden (but for the interposition of Albert of Mecklenburg).

Coati<====>66275<====>Coati The coati, genera Nasua and Nasuella, also known as the Coati-Mundi  or coatimundi  ,   hog-nosed coon,    Mexican tejón,  cholugo,  or moncún, Guatemalan, Costa Rican /‘c Belize pizote, Colombian cusumbo, and other names, is a member of the raccoon family (Procyonidae), a diurnal mammal native to South America, Central America, and south-western North America.  The term is reported to be derived from the Tupi language of Brazil.  Physical characteristicsAdult coatis measure   from head to the base of the tail, which can be as long as their bodies. 

Olaf Tryggvason<====>66278<====>Olaf Tryggvason Olaf Tryggvason (960s – 9 September 1000) was King of Norway from 995 to 1000.  He was the son of Tryggvi Olafsson, king of Viken (Vingulmark, and Rånrike), and, according to later sagas, the great-grandson of Harald Fairhair, first King of Norway. Olaf had an important part in the conversion of the Norse to Christianity, often by compulsion.He is said to have built the first Christian church in Norway, in 995, and to have founded the city of Trondheim in 997.  A statue of Olaf Tryggvason is located in the city's central plaza. 

Magnus the Good<====>66279<====>Magnus the Good  Magnus Olafsson (Old Norse: Magnús Óláfsson, Norwegian and Danish: Magnus Olavsson; c.  1024 – 25 October 1047), better known as Magnus the Good (Old Norse: Magnús góði, Norwegian and Danish: Magnus den gode), was the King of Norway from 1035 and King of Denmark from 1042, ruling over both countries until his death in 1047. He was an illegitimate son of Olaf II of Norway, but fled with his mother when his father was dethroned in 1028.  He returned to Norway in 1035 and was crowned king at the age of 11.  In 1042, he was also crowned king of Denmark. 

Charles Ives<====>66283<====>Charles Ives   Charles Edward Ives ( ; October 20, 1874 May 19, 1954) was an American  modernist  composer.  He is one of the first American composers of international renown,  though his music was largely ignored during his life, and many of his works went unperformed for many years.  Over time, he came to be regarded as an "American original".    He combined the American popular and church-music traditions of his youth with European art music, and was among the first composers to engage in a systematic program of experimental music, with musical techniques including polytonality, polyrhythm, tone clusters, aleatory elements, and quarter tones,  foreshadowing many musical innovations of the 20th century. 

Formic acid<====>66284<====>Formic acid  Formic acid, systemically named methanoic acid, is the simplest carboxylic acid.  The chemical formula is HCOOH or HCO 2 H.  It is an important intermediate in chemical synthesis and occurs naturally, most notably in some ants.  The word "formic" comes from the Latin word for ant, formica, referring to its early isolation by the distillation of ant bodies, and the trivial name in some languages means "ant-acid", such as Dutch  , Danish  , Faroese  , French   and German  .  Esters, salts, and the anions derived from formic acid are called formates. 

Organic acid<====>66286<====>Organic acid An organic acid is an organic compound with acidic properties.  The most common organic acids are the carboxylic acids, whose acidity is associated with their carboxyl group –COOH.  Sulfonic acids, containing the group –SO 2 OH, are relatively stronger acids.  Alcohols, with –OH, can act as acids but they are usually very weak.  The relative stability of the conjugate base of the acid determines its acidity.  Other groups can also confer acidity, usually weakly: the thiol group –SH, the enol group, and the phenol group.  In biological systems, organic compounds containing these groups are generally referred to as organic acids. 

Wadden Sea<====>66291<====>Wadden Sea  The Wadden Sea ( ,  ,   or  ,  ,  ,  ) is an intertidal zone in the southeastern part of the North Sea.  It lies between the coast of northwestern continental Europe and the range of Frisian Islands, forming a shallow body of water with tidal flats and wetlands.  It is rich in biological diversity.  In 2009, the Dutch and German parts of the Wadden Sea were inscribed on UNESCO's World Heritage List and the Danish part was added in June 2014.   The Wadden Sea is one of the world's seas whose coastline has been most modified by humans,  via systems of dikes and causeways on the mainland and low-lying coastal islands. 

Reinforcement learning<====>66294<====>Reinforcement learning  Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning inspired by behaviourist psychology, concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.  The problem, due to its generality, is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory, simulation-based optimization, multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, statistics and genetic algorithms.  In the operations research and control literature, the field where reinforcement learning methods are studied is called approximate dynamic programming.  The problem has been studied in the theory of optimal control, though most studies are concerned with the existence of optimal solutions and their characterization, and not with the learning or approximation aspects. 

Chinese art<====>66297<====>Chinese art  Chinese art is visual art that, whether ancient or modern, originated in or is practiced in China or by Chinese artists.  The Chinese art in the Republic of China (Taiwan) and that of overseas Chinese can also be considered part of Chinese art where it is based in or draws on Chinese heritage and Chinese culture.  Early "stone age art" dates back to 10,000 BC, mostly consisting of simple pottery and sculptures.  After this early period Chinese art, like Chinese history, is typically classified by the succession of ruling dynasties of Chinese emperors, most of which lasted several hundred years. 

Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor<====>66299<====>Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor  The Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor is a fifth-generation, single-seat, twin-engine, all-weather stealth tactical fighter aircraft developed for the United States Air Force (USAF).  The result of the USAF's Advanced Tactical Fighter program, the aircraft was designed primarily as an air superiority fighter, but also has ground attack, electronic warfare, and signal intelligence capabilities.    The prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, built most of the F-22's airframe and weapons systems and conducted final assembly, while Boeing provided the wings, aft fuselage, avionics integration, and training systems. The aircraft was variously designated F-22 and F/A-22 before it formally entered service in December 2005 as the F-22A. 

Yoni<====>66304<====>Yoni    Yoni ( ; Sanskrit: "womb", "uterus", "vagina", "vulva", "abode", or "source") is a stylised representation of female genitalia representing the goddess Shakti in Hinduism.   Within Shaivism, the sect dedicated to the god Shiva, the yoni symbolises his consort.  The male counterpart of the yoni is the lingam.  The union of the yoni and lingam represents the eternal process of creation and regeneration, the union of male and female principles, and all existence.  In art and sculpture, this union is represented by a cylinder (lingam, often interpreted as a stylised phallus)  resting within a spouted dish (yoni). 

Seven Days (TV series)<====>66305<====>Seven Days (TV series) Seven Days (also written as 7 Days) is a science fiction television series based on the premise of time travel.  It was created by Christopher and Zachary Crowe    and produced by UPN from 1998 to 2001. ProductionThree seasons of Seven Days were produced.  All three seasons have been shown in North America, and by the BBC in the United Kingdom.  There are currently no plans to release the entire series on DVD and/or Blu-ray from Paramount Home Entertainment and CBS Home Entertainment.   Seven Days was based on an idea from Kerry McCluggage, then-president of Paramount Television. 

Osmium tetroxide<====>66306<====>Osmium tetroxide Osmium tetroxide (also osmium(VIII) oxide) is the chemical compound with the formula OsO 4 .  The compound is noteworthy for its many uses, despite its toxicity and the rarity of osmium.  It also has a number of interesting properties, one being that the solid is volatile.   The compound is colourless, but most samples appear yellow.   This is most likely due to the presence of the impurity OsO 2 , which is yellow-brown in colour.  Physical propertiesOsmium(VIII) oxide forms monoclinic crystals.    It has a characteristic acrid chlorine-like odor.   The element name osmium is derived from osme, Greek for odor. 

Redox<====>66313<====>Redox  Redox (short for reduction–oxidation reaction) (pronunciation:or) is a chemical reaction in which the oxidation states of atoms are changed.  Any such reaction involves both a reduction process and a complementary oxidation process, two key concepts involved with electron transfer processes.   Redox reactions include all chemical reactions in which atoms have their oxidation state changed; in general, redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons between chemical species.  The chemical species from which the electron is stripped is said to have been oxidized, while the chemical species to which the electron is added is said to have been reduced. 

Solid-state chemistry<====>66315<====>Solid-state chemistrySolid-state chemistry, also sometimes referred to as materials chemistry, is the study of the synthesis, structure, and properties of solid phase materials, particularly, but not necessarily exclusively of, non-molecular solids.  It therefore has a strong overlap with solid-state physics, mineralogy, crystallography, ceramics, metallurgy, thermodynamics, materials science and electronics with a focus on the synthesis of novel materials and their characterisation. HistoryBecause of its direct relevance to products of commerce, solid state inorganic chemistry has been strongly driven by technology.   Progress in the field has often been fueled by the demands of industry, well ahead of purely academic curiosity. 

Burette<====>66316<====>BuretteA burette (also buret) is a laboratory equipment used in analytical chemistry for the dispensing of variable amount of a chemical solution and measuring that amount at the same time.  It is a long, graduated glass tube, with a stopcock at its lower end and a tapered capillary tube at the stopcock's outlet.  The flow of liquid from the tube to the burette tip is controlled by the stopcock valve.   There are two main types of burette; the volumetric burette and the Piston burette or Digital burette. A volumetric burette delivers measured volumes of liquid.  Piston burettes are similar to syringes, but with a precision bore and a plunger.

Group 6 element<====>66321<====>Group 6 element Group 6, numbered by IUPAC style, is a group of elements in the periodic table.  Its members are chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), and seaborgium (Sg).  These are all transition metals and chromium, molybdenum and tungsten are refractory metals.  The period 8 elements of group 6 are likely to be either unpenthexium (Uph) or unpentoctium (Upo).  This may not be possible; drip instability may imply that the periodic table ends around unbihexium.  Neither unpenthexium nor unpentoctium have been synthesized, and it is unlikely that this will happen in the near future. 

M (1931 film)<====>66322<====>M (1931 film)   M (  — M – A City Searches for a Murderer) is a 1931 German drama-thriller film directed by Fritz Lang and starring Peter Lorre.  The film was written by Lang and his wife, Thea von Harbou, and was the director's first sound film.  The film revolves around the actions of a serial killer  of children and the manhunt for him, conducted by both the police and the criminal underworld.   Now considered a classic, the film was deemed by Fritz Lang to be his finest work.   PlotA group of children are playing an elimination game in the courtyard of an apartment building in Berlin  using a chant about a murderer of children. 

Crime Traveller<====>66323<====>Crime Traveller    Crime Traveller is a 1997 science fiction detective television series produced by Carnival Films for the BBC based on the premise of using time travel for the purpose of solving crimes.  Anthony Horowitz created the series and wrote every episode.  He got the idea while writing an episode of Poirot.  Despite having over eight million viewers on a regular basis, Crime Traveller was not renewed after its first series, because according to Horowitz, "The show wasn't exactly cut.  There was a chasm at the BBC, created by the arrival of a new Head of Drama and our run ended at that time. 

Brașov<====>66326<====>Brașov Brașov ( ,  ,  ,   ) is a city in Romania and the administrative centre of Brașov County. According to the last Romanian census (2011), Brașov has a population of 253,200, making it the 7th most populous city in Romania.  The metropolitan area is home to 369,896 residents.  Brașov is located in the central part of the country, about   north of Bucharest and   from the Black Sea.  It is surrounded by the Southern Carpathians and is part of the Transylvania region. The city is notable for being the birthplace of the national anthem of Romania and for hosting the Golden Stag International Music Festival. 

Battle of Dien Bien Phu<====>66331<====>Battle of Dien Bien Phu The Battle of Dien Bien Phu ( ;  ,  ) was the climactic confrontation of the First Indochina War between the French Union's French Far East Expeditionary Corps and Viet Minh communist-nationalist revolutionaries.  It was, from the French view before the event, a set piece battle to draw out the Vietnamese and destroy them with superior firepower.  The battle occurred between March and May 1954 and culminated in a comprehensive French defeat that influenced negotiations underway at Geneva among several nations over the future of Indochina. As a result of blunders in French decision-making, the French began an operation to insert, then support, the soldiers at Điện Biên Phủ, deep in the hills of northwestern Vietnam. 

Holography<====>66338<====>Holography    Holography is the science and practice of making holograms.  Typically, a hologram is a photographic recording of a light field, rather than of an image formed by a lens, and it is used to display a fully three-dimensional image of the holographed subject, which is seen without the aid of special glasses or other intermediate optics.

Bronchodilator<====>66388<====>BronchodilatorA bronchodilator is a substance that dilates the bronchi and bronchioles, decreasing resistance in the respiratory airway and increasing airflow to the lungs.  Bronchodilators may be endogenous (originating naturally within the body), or they may be medications administered for the treatment of breathing difficulties.  They are most useful in obstructive lung diseases, of which asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are the most common conditions.  Although this remains somewhat controversial, they might be useful in bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis.  They are often prescribed but of unproven significance in restrictive lung diseases.    Bronchodilators are either short-acting or long-acting.

It is recommended in those who are unresponsive with no breathing or abnormal breathing, for example, agonal respirations.  CPR involves chest compressions for adults between   and   deep and at a rate of at least 100 to 120 per minute.The rescuer may also provide artificial ventilation by either exhaling air into the subject's mouth or nose (mouth-to-mouth resuscitation) or using a device that pushes air into the subject's lungs (mechanical ventilation).

It occurs when the heart stops beating in a regular rhythm, a condition called cardiac arrest.  The term is also sometimes used in resuscitation research. Stopped blood circulation has historically proven irreversible in most cases.  Prior to the invention of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), defibrillation, epinephrine injection, and other treatments in the 20th century, the absence of blood circulation (and vital functions related to blood circulation) was historically considered the official definition of death. 

Island of stability<====>66394<====>Island of stability   In nuclear physics, the island of stability is the prediction that a set of heavy nuclides with a near magic number of protons and neutrons will temporarily reverse the trend of decreasing stability in elements heavier than uranium.

Estimates of the stability of the elements on the island are usually around a half-life of minutes or days, however some estimates predict half-lives of millions of years. 

Transfermium Wars<====>66400<====>Transfermium Wars The names for the chemical elements 104 to 106 were the subject of a major controversy starting in the 1960s, described by some nuclear chemists as the Transfermium Wars   because it concerned the elements following fermium (element 100) on the periodic table. This controversy arose from disputes between American scientists and Soviet scientists as to which had first isolated these elements.  The final resolution of this controversy in 1997 also decided the names of elements 107 to 109.

Mi-go<====>66492<====>Mi-go   Mi-go are a fictional race of extraterrestrials created by H.  P.  Lovecraft and used by others in the Cthulhu Mythos setting.  The word Mi-go comes from "Migou", a Tibetan word for yeti.  The aliens are fungus-based lifeforms which are extremely varied due to their prodigious surgical, biological, chemical, and mechanical skill.  The variants witnessed by Akeley in "The Whisperer in Darkness" look like winged humanoid crabs, and do not resemble yeti. Mi-go are first named as such in Lovecraft's short story "The Whisperer in Darkness" (1931).  However this is considered an elaboration on earlier references in his sonnet cycle Fungi from Yuggoth (1929–30) to descriptions of alien vegetation on dream-worlds.

Dietary fiber<====>66554<====>Dietary fiber Dietary fiber or roughage is the indigestible portion of food derived from plants.  It has two main components:   Soluble fiber, which dissolves in water, is readily fermented in the colon into gases and physiologically active byproducts, and can be prebiotic and viscous.  This delays gastric emptying which, in humans, can result in an extended feeling of fullness. Insoluble fiber, which does not dissolve in water, is metabolically inert and provides bulking, or it can be fermented in the large intestine.  Bulking fibers absorb water as they move through the digestive system, easing defecation.

Nutrient<====>66575<====>Nutrient A nutrient is a substance used by an organism to survive, grow, and reproduce.  The requirement for dietary nutrient intake applies to animals, plants, fungi, and protists.  Nutrients can be incorporated into cells for metabolic purposes or excreted by cells to create non-cellular structures, such as hair, scales, feathers, or exoskeletons.  Some nutrients can be metabolically converted to smaller molecules in the process of releasing energy, such as for carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and fermentation products (ethanol or vinegar), leading to end-products of water and carbon dioxide.  All organisms require water.  Essential nutrients for animals are the energy sources, some of the amino acids that are combined to create proteins, a subset of fatty acids, vitamins and certain minerals.

Ornament (music)<====>66614<====>Ornament (music) In music, ornaments or embellishments are musical flourishes—typically, added notes—that are not essential to carry the overall line of the melody (or harmony), but serve instead to decorate or "ornament" that line (or harmony), provide added interest and variety, and give the performer the opportunity to add expressiveness to a song or piece.  Many ornaments are performed as "fast notes" around a central, main note.  There are many types of ornaments, ranging from the addition of a single, short grace note before a main note to the performance of a virtuostic and flamboyant trill.

Light curve<====>66675<====>Light curve In astronomy, a light curve is a graph of light intensity of a celestial object or region, as a function of time.  The light is usually in a particular frequency interval or band.  Light curves can be periodic, as in the case of eclipsing binaries, Cepheid variables, other periodic variables, and transiting extrasolar planets, or aperiodic, like the light curve of a nova, a cataclysmic variable star, a supernova or a microlensing event.  The study of the light curve, together with other observations, can yield considerable information about the physical process that produces it or constrain the physical theories about it. 

Tropic of Cancer<====>66676<====>Tropic of Cancer  The Tropic of Cancer, also referred to as the Northern Tropic, is currently   north of the Equator.  It is the most northerly circle of latitude on Earth at which the Sun can be directly overhead.   This occurs on the June solstice, when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun to its maximum extent.

In recognition of the pilots' qualifications and responsibilities, most militaries and many airlines worldwide award aviator badges to their pilots, and this includes naval aviators. History The first recorded use of the term aviator (aviateur in French) was in 1887, as a variation of "aviation", from the Latin avis (meaning bird), coined in 1863 by G.

Samara (fruit)<====>66698<====>Samara (fruit)A samara is a winged achene, a type of fruit in which a flattened wing of fibrous, papery tissue develops from the ovary wall.  A samara is a simple dry fruit and indehiscent (not opening along a seam).  The shape of a samara enables the wind to carry the seed farther away than regular seeds from the parent tree,  and is thus a form of anemochory. In some cases the seed is in the centre of the wing, as in the elms (genus Ulmus), the hoptree (Ptelea trifoliata), and the bushwillows (genus Combretum). In other cases the seed is on one side, with the wing extending to the other side, making the seed autorotate as it falls, as in the maples (genus Acer) and ash trees (genus Fraxinus).

It contains 45–65 species of usually medium to large trees, mostly deciduous though a few subtropical species are evergreen.  The genus is widespread across much of Europe, Asia and North America.   The tree's common English name, "ash", traces back to the Old English æsc, while the generic name originated in Latin.  Both words also mean "spear" in their respective languages.

Hindustani language<====>66715<====>Hindustani language Hindustani (    ), historically also known as Hindavi, Dehlavi and Rekhta, is the lingua franca of North India and Pakistan.   It is an Indo-Aryan language, deriving its base primarily from the Khariboli dialect of Delhi.  The language incorporates a large amount of vocabulary from Sanskrit, Persian and Arabic.   It is a pluricentric language, with two official forms, Modern Standard Hindi and Modern Standard Urdu,    which are its standardised registers, and which may be called Hindustani or Hindi-Urdu when taken together. 

Evergreen<====>66719<====>Evergreen In botany, an evergreen is a plant that has leaves throughout the year, always green.  This is true even if the plant retains its foliage only in warm climates, and contrasts with deciduous plants, which completely lose their foliage during the winter or dry season.  There are many different kinds of evergreen plants, both trees and shrubs.  Evergreens include:most species of conifers (e. g. , pine, hemlock, blue spruce, red cedar, and white/scots/jack pine), but not all (e. g. , larch)live oak, holly, and "ancient" gymnosperms such as cycadsmost angiosperms from frost-free climates, such as eucalypts and rainforest treesclubmosses and relatives The Latin binomial term  , meaning "always green", refers to the evergreen nature of the plant, for instanceCupressus sempervirens (a cypress)Lonicera sempervirens (a honeysuckle)Sequoia sempervirens (a sequoia)Leaf persistence in evergreen plants varies from a few months to several decades (over thirty years in the Great Basin Bristlecone Pine ). 

Deciduous<====>66722<====>DeciduousIn the fields of horticulture and botany, the term deciduous means "falling off at maturity"  and "tending to fall off" , in reference to trees and shrubs that seasonally shed leaves, usually in the autumn; to the shedding of petals, after flowering; and to the shedding of ripe fruit. Generally, the term deciduous means "the dropping of a part that is no longer needed" and the "falling away [of a part] after its purpose is finished".  In plants, it is the result of natural processes.  "Deciduous" has a similar meaning when referring to animal parts, such as deciduous antlers in deer,  deciduous teeth (baby teeth) in some mammals (including humans); or decidua, the uterine lining that sheds off after birth. 

Respiratory system<====>66723<====>Respiratory system  The respiratory system (also respiratory apparatus, ventilatory system) is a biological system consisting of specific organs and structures used for gas exchange in animals and plants.  The anatomy and physiology that make this happen varies greatly, depending on the size of the organism, the environment in which it lives and its evolutionary history.  In land animals the respiratory surface is internalized as linings of the lungs.Gas exchange in the lungs occurs in millions of small air sacs called alveoli in mammals and reptiles, but atria in birds.  These microscopic air sacs have a very rich blood supply, thus bringing the air into close contact with the blood. 

Trail<====>66728<====>Trail A trail is usually a path, track or unpaved lane or road.  In the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland path or footpath is the preferred term for a walking trail.  The term is also applied, in North America, to routes along rivers, and sometimes to highways.  In the US, the term was historically used for a route into or through wild territory used by emigrants (e. g.  the Oregon Trail).  Some trails are single use and can only be used for walking, cycling, horse riding, snowshoeing, and cross-country skiing; others, as in the case of a bridleway in the UK, are multi-use, and can be used by walkers, cyclists and equestrians.

Snorkeling<====>66733<====>Snorkeling  Snorkeling (British and Commonwealth English spelling: snorkelling) is the practice of swimming on or through a body of water while equipped with a diving mask, a shaped breathing tube called a snorkel, and usually swimfins.  In cooler waters, a wetsuit may also be worn.  Use of this equipment allows the snorkeler to observe underwater attractions for extended periods  with relatively little effort and to breathe while face-down at the surface. Snorkeling is a popular recreational activity, particularly at tropical resort locations.  The primary appeal is the opportunity to observe underwater life in a natural setting without the complicated equipment and training required for scuba diving. 

One-China policy<====>66739<====>One-China policy   The concept of One-China has different interpretations.   The People's Republic of China (PRC) follows the "One China Principle", whereas the United States has a "One China Policy".    The Republic of China (ROC, Taiwan) is divided over the concept.   The two main political parties have different takes on the concept.  The Kuomintang (KMT) maintains a "One China ROC" (一個中國，中華民國)  but the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) wants to renounce the idea of 'One China'.    There are, in effect, five different interpretations of the concept.  The "One China principle" is the principle that insists both Taiwan and mainland China are inalienable parts of a single "China".

Regional planning<====>66774<====>Regional planning Regional planning  deals with the efficient placement of land-use activities, infrastructure, and settlement growth across a larger area of land than an individual city or town.   Regional planning is a sub-field of urban planning as it relates land use practices on a broader scale. it also includes formulating laws that will guide the efficient planning and management of such said regions.  NomenclatureAlthough the term "regional planning" is nearly universal in English-speaking countries the areas covered and specific administrative set ups vary widely.  In North America, regional planning may encompass more than one state, such as the Regional Plan Association, or a larger conurbation or network of settlements. 

Oberon (moon)<====>66781<====>Oberon (moon) Oberon, also designated  , is the outermost major moon of the planet Uranus.  It is the second-largest and second most massive of the Uranian moons, and the ninth most massive moon in the Solar System.  Discovered by William Herschel in 1787, Oberon is named after the mythical king of the fairies who appears as a character in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream.  Its orbit lies partially outside Uranus's magnetosphere. It is likely that Oberon formed from the accretion disk that surrounded Uranus just after the planet's formation.  The moon consists of approximately equal amounts of ice and rock, and is probably differentiated into a rocky core and an icy mantle. 

The Psychedelic Furs<====>66782<====>The Psychedelic Furs   The Psychedelic Furs are an English rock band founded in London in February 1977.

Interchange File Format<====>66783<====>Interchange File Format  Interchange File Format (IFF), is a generic container file format originally introduced by the Electronic Arts company in 1985 (in cooperation with Commodore/Amiga) in order to facilitate transfer of data between software produced by different companies. IFF files do not have any standard extension.   On many systems that generate IFF files, file extensions are not important (the OS stores file format metadata separately from the file name).   An  . iff  extension is commonly used for ILBM format files, which use the IFF container format. Resource Interchange File Format is a format developed by Microsoft and IBM in 1991 that is based on IFF, except the byte order has been changed to little-endian to match the x86 processor architecture. 

Audio Interchange File Format<====>66785<====>Audio Interchange File Format    Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF) is an audio file format standard used for storing sound data for personal computers and other electronic audio devices.   The format was developed by Apple Inc.  in 1988 based on Electronic Arts' Interchange File Format (IFF, widely used on Amiga systems) and is most commonly used on Apple Macintosh computer systems. The audio data in most AIFF files is uncompressed pulse-code modulation (PCM).  This type of AIFF file uses much more disk space than lossy formats like MP3—about 10 MB for one minute of stereo audio at a sample rate of 44.

Fibroblast<====>66797<====>Fibroblast A fibroblast is a type of cell that synthesizes the extracellular matrix and collagen,  the structural framework (stroma) for animal tissues, and plays a critical role in wound healing.  Fibroblasts are the most common cells of connective tissue in animals. StructureFibroblasts have a branched cytoplasm surrounding an elliptical, speckled nucleus having two or more nucleoli.  Active fibroblasts can be recognized by their abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum.  Inactive fibrocytes are smaller, spindle shaped, and have a reduced rough endoplasmic reticulum.  Although disjointed and scattered when they have to cover a large space, fibroblasts, when crowded, often locally align in parallel clusters.

Comarques of Catalonia<====>66818<====>Comarques of Catalonia This is a list of the 42 comarques (singular comarca,  ) into which Catalonia is divided.  A comarca is a group of municipalities, roughly equivalent to a US or UK "county".  However, in the context of Catalonia, the term "county" can be a bit misleading, because in medieval Catalonia, the most important rulers were counts, notably the Counts of Barcelona and of Urgell.  Comarques have no particular relation to the "counties" that were ruled by counts. OverviewAlthough today the comarques are officially recognized, for centuries they had existed unofficially, with citizens identifying with a particular comarca in the same way that people in other parts of the world might identify with a particular region. 

Root mean square<====>66819<====>Root mean square In statistics and its applications, the root mean square (abbreviated RMS or rms) is defined as the square root of mean square (the arithmetic mean of the squares of a set of numbers).    The RMS is also known as the quadratic mean and is a particular case of the generalized mean with exponent 2. RMS can also be defined for a continuously varying function in terms of an integral of the squares of the instantaneous values during a cycle. For a cyclically alternating electric current, RMS is equal to the value of the direct current that would produce the same average power dissipation in a resistive load.

Memory management<====>66924<====>Memory management    Memory management is a form of resource management applied to computer memory.   The essential requirement of memory management is to provide ways to dynamically allocate portions of memory to programs at their request, and free it for reuse when no longer needed.  This is critical to any advanced computer system where more than a single process might be underway at any time.  Several methods have been devised that increase the effectiveness of memory management.  Virtual memory systems separate the memory addresses used by a process from actual physical addresses, allowing separation of processes and increasing the size of the virtual address space beyond the available amount of RAM using paging or swapping to secondary storage.

Queer<====>66935<====>Queer   Queer is an umbrella term for sexual and gender minorities who are not heterosexual and/or not cisgender.  Originally meaning "strange" or "peculiar", queer came to be used pejoratively against those with same-sex desires or relationships in the late 19th century.  Beginning in the late 1980s, queer scholars and activists began to reclaim the word to establish community and assert an identity distinct from the gay identity.  People who reject traditional gender identities and seek a broader and deliberately ambiguous alternative to the label LGBT may describe themselves as queer. Queer is also increasingly used to describe non-normative "Non-normative" does not mean "not normal", but rather refers to the privileging of "normal" genders and sexualities over the "non-normative". 

LGBT<====>66936<====>LGBT    LGBT or GLBT is an initialism that stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender.

Acronyms, Initialisms & Abbreviations Dictionary, Volume 1, Part 1.  Gale Research Co. , 1985,   . Factsheet five, Issues 32–36, Mike Gunderloy, 1989  Activists believed that the term gay community did not accurately represent all those to whom it referred.  The initialism has become mainstream as a self-designation; it has been adopted by the majority of sexuality and gender identity-based community centers and media in the United States, as well as some other English-speaking countries. 

Cisgender<====>66937<====>Cisgender    Cisgender (often abbreviated to simply cis) is a term for people whose gender identity matches the sex that they were assigned at birth.

Related terms include cissexism and cisnormativity. Etymology and terminologyGerman sexologist Volkmar Sigusch used the neologism cissexual (zissexuell in German) in a peer-reviewed publication.  In his 1998 essay "The Neosexual Revolution", he cites his two-part 1991 article "Die Transsexuellen und unser nosomorpher Blick" ("Transsexuals and our nosomorphic view") as the origin of the term.

Ship model<====>66940<====>Ship model Ship models or model ships are scale models of ships.  They can range in size from 1/6000 scale wargaming miniatures to large vessels capable of holding people.  Ship modeling is a craft as old as shipbuilding itself, stretching back to ancient times when water transport was first developed. HistoryModels of boats and ships from the Ancient MediterraneanAncient ship and boat models have been discovered throughout the Mediterranean, especially from ancient Greece, Egypt, and Phoenicia.  These models provide archaeologists with valuable information regarding seafaring technology and the sociological and economic importance of seafaring.  In spite of how helpful ancient boat and ship models are to archaeologists, they are not always easily or correctly interpreted due to artists’ mistakes, ambiguity in the model design, and wear and tear over the centuries.

The team's logo is one of the most iconic and recognizable in all of sports.   The Flyers' all-time points percentage of 57. 6% ( ) is the second-best in the NHL, behind only the Montreal Canadiens' 59. 

Lerum Municipality<====>66944<====>Lerum Municipality{{Infobox settlement }}Lerum Municipality (Lerums kommun) is a municipality in Västra Götaland County in western Sweden, situated just east of Gothenburg.  Its seat is located in the town of Lerum. In 1969 the municipality got its present size when "old" Lerum was amalgamated with Skallsjö and Stora Lundby. In 2007, Lerum Municipality launched a new logotype to be used instead of its official municipal coat of arms which features the head of an ox and three oak leaves.   Municipal officials and PR staff felt the coat "outdated".  Although no longer used, the coat of arms still has official status. 

Józef Piłsudski<====>66951<====>Józef Piłsudski   Józef Klemens Piłsudski  ( ; 5 December 1867 – 12 May 1935) was a Polish statesman; he was Chief of State (1918–22), "First Marshal of Poland" (from 1920), and de facto leader (1926–35) of the Second Polish Republic, Minister of Military Affairs.  From mid-World War I he had a major influence in Poland's politics, and was an important figure on the European political scene.   He was the person most responsible for the creation of the Second Polish Republic in 1918, 123 years after it had been taken over by Russia, Austria and Prussia. 

Fourth Age<====>66954<====>Fourth Age  In the fictional world of Middle-earth, "'the Fourth Age'" and the ages that preceded it, are time periods from J.  R.  R.  Tolkien's universe of Middle-earth, described in his fantasy writings.  Because most of his fiction concerning Middle-earth deals with earlier ages, there is relatively little material on the ages that followed the Third Age. The Fourth Age followed the defeat of Sauron and the destruction of his One Ring, but did not officially begin until after the Bearers of the Three Rings left Middle-earth for Valinor, the 'Uttermost West'.  Some events of the first centuries of the Fourth Age can be gleaned from the Appendices in The Lord of the Rings, and follow below. 

Ho Chi Minh City<====>66956<====>Ho Chi Minh City  Ho Chi Minh City ( ;  ) or  ,  also informally known by its former name of Saigon ( ;  ), is the largest city in Vietnam by population.  It was known as Prey Nokor ( ) prior to annexation by the Vietnamese in the 17th century.  Under the name Saigon, it was the capital of the French colony of Cochinchina and later of the independent republic of South Vietnam 1955–75.  On 2 July 1976, Saigon merged with the surrounding Gia Định Province and was officially renamed Ho Chi Minh City after revolutionary leader Hồ Chí Minh (although the name   is still widely used). 

Renminbi<====>66958<====>RenminbiThe renminbi (Ab. : RMB;  ; sign:  ; code: CNY) is the official currency of the People's Republic of China.  The yuan ( ) is the basic unit of the renminbi, but is also used to refer to the Chinese currency generally, especially in international contexts where "Chinese yuan" is widely used to refer to the renminbi.  The distinction between the terms renminbi and yuan is similar to that between sterling and pound, which respectively refer to the British currency and its primary unit.   One yuan is subdivided into 10 jiao ( ), and a jiao in turn is subdivided into 10 fen ( ). 

Typha<====>66962<====>Typha  Typha   is a genus of about 30 species of monocotyledonous flowering plants in the family Typhaceae.  These plants have many common names, in British English as bulrush, or reedmace,  in American English as cattail,  punks, or corn dog grass, in Australia as cumbungi or bulrush, in Canada as bulrush or cattail, and in New Zealand as raupō.  Other taxa of plants may be known as bulrush, including some sedges in Scirpus and related genera. The genus is largely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, where it is found in a variety of wetland habitats. 

Pittsburgh Penguins<====>66964<====>Pittsburgh Penguins  The Pittsburgh Penguins are a professional ice hockey team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  They are members of the Metropolitan Division of the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL).  The franchise was founded in 1967 as one of the first expansion teams during the league's original expansion from six to twelve teams.  The Penguins played in the Civic Arena, also known to Pittsburgh fans as "The Igloo", from the time of their inception through the end of the 2009–10 season.  They moved into their new arena, PPG Paints Arena, to begin the 2010–11 season. 

Vascular plant<====>66966<====>Vascular plant  Vascular plants (from Latin vasculum: duct), also known as tracheophytes (from the equivalent Greek term trachea) and also higher plants, form a large group of plants (c.  308,312 accepted known species    ) that are defined as those land plants that have lignified tissues (the xylem) for conducting water and minerals throughout the plant.  They also have a specialized non-lignified tissue (the phloem) to conduct products of photosynthesis.  Vascular plants include the clubmosses, horsetails, ferns, gymnosperms (including conifers) and angiosperms (flowering plants).  Scientific names for the group include Tracheophyta  and Tracheobionta. 

Stanley Cup<====>66968<====>Stanley CupThe Stanley Cup ( ) is the championship trophy awarded annually to the National Hockey League (NHL) playoff winner.  It is the oldest existing trophy to be awarded to a professional sports franchise, and the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) considers it to be one of the "most important championships available to the sport".   Originally commissioned in 1892 as the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup, the trophy is named after Lord Stanley of Preston, then–Governor General of Canada, who donated it as an award to Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club, which the entire Stanley family supported, with the sons and daughters playing and promoting the game. 

Ofra Haza<====>66970<====>Ofra Haza Bat-Sheva Ofra Haza-Ashkenazi ( ; November 19, 1957  February 23, 2000) was an Israeli singer, actress and Grammy Award-nominee recording artist, commonly known as "The Israeli Madonna",  or "Madonna of the East".   Her voice has been described as a "tender" mezzo-soprano.  Inspired by a love of her Yemenite Jewish and Hebrew culture, her music quickly spread to a wider Middle Eastern audience.   As her career progressed, Haza was able to switch between traditional and more commercial singing styles without jeopardizing her credibility.  Her music fused elements of Eastern and Western instrumentation, orchestration and dance-beat. 

Shepton Mallet<====>66971<====>Shepton Mallet   Shepton Mallet is a town and civil parish in the Mendip district of Somerset in South West England.  Situated approximately   south of Bristol and   east of Wells, the town is estimated to have a population of 10,369.It contains the administrative headquarters of Mendip District Council. The Mendip Hills lie to the north, and the River Sheppey runs through the town.  Shepton Mallet lies on the route of the Fosse Way, the principal Roman road into the south west of England, and there is evidence of Roman settlement. 

Hockey Night in Canada<====>66972<====>Hockey Night in Canada   Hockey Night in Canada (often abbreviated Hockey Night or HNIC) is a branding used for Canadian television presentations of the National Hockey League.  While the name has been used for all NHL broadcasts on CBC Television (regardless of the time of day), Hockey Night in Canada is primarily associated with its Saturday night NHL broadcasts, a practice originating from Saturday NHL broadcasts that began in 1931 on the CNR Radio network and continued on its successors, and debuting on television beginning in 1952.  Initially only airing a single game weekly, the modern incarnation airs a weekly double-header, with game times normally at 7:00 and 10:00 p. 

Lycopodiopsida<====>66973<====>Lycopodiopsida  Lycopodiopsida is a class of herbaceous vascular plants known as the clubmosses and firmosses.  They have dichotomously branching stems bearing simple leaves without ligules and reproduce by means of spores borne in sporangia at the bases of the leaves.   Traditionally, the group also included  the spikemosses (Selaginella and relatives) and the quillworts (Isoetes and relatives) but because these groups have leaves with ligules and reproduce using spores of two different sizes both are now placed into another class, Isoetopsida that also includes the extinct Lepidodendrales.   These groups, together with the horsetails are often referred to informally as fern allies. 

Apophatic theology<====>66975<====>Apophatic theology  Apophatic theology, also known as negative theology,  is a type of theological thinking and religious practice that attempts to approach God, the Divine, by negation, to speak only in terms of what may not be said about the perfect goodness that is God.   It forms a pair together with cataphatic theology, which approaches God or the Divine by affirmations c. q.  positive statements about what God is.  The apophatic tradition is often, though not always, allied with the approach of mysticism, which aims at the vision of God, the perception of the divine reality beyond the realm of ordinary perception. 

Duany Plater-Zyberk<====>66977<====>Duany Plater-ZyberkDPZ Partners (DPZ; formerly Duany Plater-Zyberk & Company) is a Miami, Florida-based architecture and town planning firm founded in 1980 by the husband-and-wife team of Andrés Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk.  It is one of the dominant firms specializing in new urbanist town planning in the United States and other countries, having completed designs for over 300 new and existing communities.  In addition to Duany and Plater-Zyberk, DPZ's Partners include Galina Tachieva, Marina Khoury, Senen M.  A.  Antonio and Matthew J.  Lambert. Areas of practiceAreas of practice include regional and downtown plans, new towns, urban infill, villages and resort villages, transit-oriented development, suburban retrofits, campuses, housing, affordable housing, and civic buildings. 

Tasman Sea<====>66979<====>Tasman Sea  The Tasman Sea (Māori: Te Tai-o-Rehua ) is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand.  It measures about   across and about   from north to south.   The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who was the first recorded European to encounter New Zealand and Tasmania.  The British explorer Captain James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s as part of his first voyage of exploration.  The Tasman Sea is informally referred to in both Australian and New Zealand English as The Ditch; for example, crossing the Ditch means travelling to Australia from New Zealand, or vice versa. 

Epidemic<====>66981<====>Epidemic An epidemic (from Greek ἐπί epi "upon or above" and δῆμος demos "people") is the rapid spread of infectious disease to a large number of people in a given population within a short period of time, usually two weeks or less.  For example, in meningococcal infections, an attack rate in excess of 15 cases per 100,000 people for two consecutive weeks is considered an epidemic.Epidemics of infectious disease are generally caused by several factors including a change in the ecology of the host population (e. g.  increased stress or increase in the density of a vector species), a genetic change in the pathogen reservoir or the introduction of an emerging pathogen to a host population (by movement of pathogen or host). 

IJssel<====>66982<====>IJssel  The river IJssel ( ), sometimes called Gelderse IJssel ("Gueldern IJssel") to avoid confusion with the Hollandse IJssel, is the branch of the Rhine in the Dutch provinces of Gelderland and Overijssel.  The Romans knew the river as Isala.  The IJssel flows from Westervoort, east of the city of Arnhem, until it discharges into the IJsselmeer ("Lake IJssel", known prior to the 1932 completion of the Afsluitdijk as the Zuiderzee, a North Sea inlet).  The River IJssel is one of the three major distributary branches (along with the rivers Nederrijn and Waal) into which the Rhine divides shortly after crossing the German-Dutch border. 

Reforestation<====>66984<====>ReforestationReforestation is the natural or intentional restocking of existing forests and woodlands (forestation) that have been depleted, usually through deforestation.Reforestation can be used to rectify or improve the quality of human life by soaking up pollution and dust from the air, rebuild natural habitats and ecosystems, mitigate global warming since forests facilitate biosequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide,  and harvest for resources, particularly timber, but also non-timber forest products. A similar concept, afforestation, another type of forestation, refers to the process of restoring and recreating areas of woodlands or forests that may have existed long ago but were deforested or otherwise removed at some point in the past or lacked it naturally (e. 

Woodland<====>66986<====>Woodland Woodland   is a low-density forest forming open habitats with plenty of sunlight and limited shade.  Woodlands may support an understory of shrubs and herbaceous plants including grasses.  Woodland may form a transition to shrubland under drier conditions or during early stages of primary or secondary succession.   Higher density areas of trees with a largely closed canopy that provides extensive and nearly continuous shade are referred to as forests.  Extensive efforts by conservationist groups have been made to preserve woodlands from urbanization and agriculture.  The woodlands in Northwest Indiana being an example, having been preserved as part of the Indiana Dunes. 

Aksai Chin<====>66988<====>Aksai Chin    Aksai Chin ( ;  ) is a disputed border area between China and India.  It is administered by China as part of Hotan County, which lies in the southwestern part of Hotan Prefecture of Xinjiang Autonomous Region, but is also claimed by India as a part of the Ladakh region of the state of Jammu and Kashmir.  In 1962, China and India fought a brief war in Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh, but in 1993 and 1996, the two countries signed agreements to respect the Line of Actual Control.    NameThe etymology of Aksai Chin is uncertain regarding the word "chin". 

The Blind Watchmaker<====>66991<====>The Blind Watchmaker    The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe without Design is a 1986 book by Richard Dawkins, in which the author presents an explanation of, and argument for, the theory of evolution by means of natural selection.  He also presents arguments to refute certain criticisms made on his first book, The Selfish Gene.  (Both books espouse the gene-centric view of evolution. ) An unabridged audiobook edition was released in 2011, narrated by Richard Dawkins and Lalla Ward. OverviewIn his choice of the title for this book, Dawkins refers to the watchmaker analogy made famous by William Paley in his 1802 book Natural Theology. 

Shade (shadow)<====>66992<====>Shade (shadow) Shade is the blocking of sunlight (in particular direct sunshine) by any object, and also the shadow created by that object.  Shade also consists of the colors grey, black, white, etc.  It may refer to blocking of sunlight by a roof, a tree, an umbrella, a window shade or blind, curtains, or other objects. As a resourceShade is an important issue in temperate and tropical zones for providing cooling and shelter from the sun. PlantsGreen plants produce shade by absorbing sunlight to invest as energy in photosynthesis to produce sugar.  They also actively transpire, producing an additional cooling effect. 

Kin selection<====>66996<====>Kin selection Kin selection is the evolutionary strategy that favours the reproductive success of an organism's relatives, even at a cost to the organism's own survival and reproduction.  Kin altruism is altruistic behaviour whose evolution is driven by kin selection.  Kin selection is an instance of inclusive fitness, which combines the number of offspring produced with the number an individual can ensure the production of by supporting others, such as siblings. Charles Darwin discussed the concept of kin selection in his 1859 book, The Origin of Species, where he reflected on the puzzle of sterile social insects, such as honey bees, which leave reproduction to their mothers, arguing that a selection benefit to related organisms (the same "stock") would allow the evolution of a trait that confers the benefit but destroys an individual at the same time. 

Epidemiology<====>66997<====>Epidemiology   Epidemiology is the study and analysis of the distribution  and determinants of health and disease conditions in defined populations.  It is the cornerstone of public health, and shapes policy decisions and evidence-based practice by identifying risk factors for disease and targets for preventive healthcare.  Epidemiologists help with study design, collection, and statistical analysis of data, amend interpretation and dissemination of results (including peer review and occasional systematic review).  Epidemiology has helped develop methodology used in clinical research, public health studies, and, to a lesser extent, basic research in the biological sciences.  Major areas of epidemiological study include disease causation, transmission, outbreak investigation, disease surveillance, forensic epidemiology, Occupational epidemiology, screening, biomonitoring, and comparisons of treatment effects such as in clinical trials. 

Stephen R. Donaldson<====>67000<====>Stephen R.  Donaldson  Stephen Reeder Donaldson (born May 13, 1947) is an American fantasy, science fiction and mystery novelist, most famous for The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, his ten-novel fantasy series.  His work is characterized by psychological complexity, conceptual abstractness, moral bleakness, and the use of an arcane vocabulary, and has attracted critical praise for its "imagination, vivid characterizations, and fast pace".   He earned his bachelor's degree from The College of Wooster and a Master's degree from Kent State University.   He currently resides in New Mexico. In the United Kingdom he is usually called "Stephen Donaldson" (without the "R"). 

Carrie (novel)<====>67003<====>Carrie (novel) Carrie is a novel by American author Stephen King.  It was his first published novel, released on April 5, 1974, with an approximate first print-run of 30,000 copies.   Set primarily in the then-future year of 1979, it revolves around the eponymous Carrie White, a misfit and bullied high school girl who uses her newly discovered telekinetic powers to exact revenge on those who torment her.  While in this process, she causes one of the worst local disasters the town has ever had.   King has commented that he finds the work to be "raw" and "with a surprising power to hurt and horrify. 

Edain<====>67007<====>EdainFor the queen in  Irish mythology, see Étaín. In the fiction of J.  R.  R.  Tolkien, the Edain   were men (humans) who made their way into Beleriand in the First Age, and were friendly to the Elves. The Sindarin word Edain (the second syllable is pronounced as English dine rather than English dane; the stress falls on the first syllable), singular Adan (Quenya Atani, Atan) literally meant Second People, and originally referred to all Men, but later it only applied to the Men of Beleriand and their descendants.  The Quenya term Atani kept its old meaning. 

Beleriand<====>67008<====>Beleriand  In J.  R.  R.  Tolkien's fictional legendarium, Beleriand was a region in northwestern Middle-earth during the First Age.  Events in Beleriand are described chiefly in his work The Silmarillion, which tells the story of the early ages of Middle-earth in a style similar to the epic hero tales of Nordic literature.   Beleriand also appears in the works The Book of Lost Tales,  The Children of Húrin,  and in the epic poems of The Lays of Beleriand. Internal settingGeographyOriginally, the name belonged only to the area around the Bay of Balar, but in time, the name was applied to the entire land. 

King John (play)<====>67013<====>King John (play)   King John, a history play by William Shakespeare, dramatises the reign of John, King of England (ruled 1199–1216), son of Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine and father of Henry III of England. It is believed to have been written in the mid-1590s but was not published until it appeared in the First Folio in 1623.King John is generally viewed as one of Shakespeare's weaker efforts. Characters  King John – King of EnglandEleanor  – the queen-mother, widow of Henry IIPrince Henry – his son, later King Henry IIIBlanche of Castile – John's nieceEarl of Essex – English noblemanEarl of Salisbury – English noblemanEarl of Pembroke – English noblemanLord Bigot – Earl of NorfolkPeter of Pomfret – a prophetPhilip Faulconbridge – also known as Philip the Bastard and Richard Plantagenet; natural son of Richard I of EnglandRobert Faulconbridge – his half brother; legitimate son of Sir Robert FaulconbridgeLady Faulconbridge – their mother; widow of Sir Robert FalconbridgeJames Gurney – her attendantLady Constance – widow of Geoffrey II, Duke of BrittanyArthur – her son, King John's nephew, claimant to the English throne and eventual Duke of Brittany  SheriffTwo ExecutionersEnglish HeraldEnglish MessengerKing Philip – King of FranceLouis the Dauphin  – his sonViscount of MelunChantillon – French ambassador to EnglandHubert  – citizen of Angers and later a follower of King JohnCitizen of AngiersFrench HeraldFrench MessengerLimoges, Duke of AustriaCardinal Pandolf – legate from Pope Innocent IIILords, soldiers, attendants etc.  SynopsisKing John receives an ambassador from France, who demands, on pain of war, that he renounce his throne in favour of his nephew, Arthur, whom the French King, Philip, believes to be the rightful heir to the throne.John adjudicates an inheritance dispute between Robert Faulconbridge and his older brother Philip the Bastard, during which it becomes apparent that Philip is the illegitimate son of King Richard I. Queen Eleanor, mother to both Richard and John, recognises the family resemblance and suggests that he renounce his claim to the Falconbridge land in exchange for a knighthood. John knights the Bastard under the name Richard.In France, King Philip and his forces besiege the English-ruled town of Angiers, threatening attack unless its citizens support Arthur. Philip is supported by Austria, who is believed to have killed King Richard. The English contingent arrives; Eleanor trades insults with Constance, Arthur's mother. Kings Philip and John stake their claims in front of Angiers' citizens, but to no avail: their representative says that they will support the rightful king, whoever that turns out to be.The French and English armies clash, but no clear victor emerges. Each army dispatches a herald claiming victory, but Angiers' citizens continue to refuse to recognize either claimant because neither army has proven victorious.The Bastard proposes that England and France unite to punish the rebellious citizens of Angiers, at which point they propose an alternative: Philip's son, Louis the Dauphin, should marry John's niece Blanche, a scheme that gives John a stronger claim to the throne, while Louis gains territory for France. Though a furious Constance accuses Philip of abandoning Arthur, Louis and Blanche are married.Cardinal Pandolf arrives from Rome bearing a formal accusation that John has disobeyed the pope and appointed an archbishop contrary to his desires. John refuses to recant, whereupon he is excommunicated. Pandolf pledges his support for Louis, though Philip is hesitant, having just established family ties with John. Pandolf brings him round by pointing out that his links to the church are older and firmer.War breaks out; Austria is beheaded by the Bastard in revenge for his father's death; and both Angiers and Arthur are captured by the English. Eleanor is left in charge of English possessions in France, while the Bastard is sent to collect funds from English monasteries. John orders Hubert to kill Arthur. Pandolf suggests to Louis that he now has as strong a claim to the English throne as Arthur (and indeed John), and Louis agrees to invade England.Hubert finds himself unable to kill Arthur. John's nobles urge Arthur's release. John agrees, but is wrong-footed by Hubert's announcement that Arthur is dead. The nobles, believing he was murdered, defect to Louis' side. The Bastard reports that the monasteries are unhappy about John's attempt to seize their gold. Hubert has a furious argument with John, during which he reveals that Arthur is still alive. John, delighted, sends him to report the news to the nobles.Arthur dies jumping from a castle wall.  (It is open to interpretation whether he deliberately kills himself or just makes a risky escape attempt.)  The nobles believe he was murdered by John, and refuse to believe Hubert's entreaties. John attempts to make a deal with Pandolf, swearing allegiance to the Pope in exchange for Pandolf's negotiating with the French on his behalf. John orders the Bastard, one of his few remaining loyal subjects, to lead the English army against France.While John's former noblemen swear allegiance to Louis, Pandolf explains John's scheme, but Louis refuses to be taken in by it. The Bastard arrives with the English army and threatens Louis, but to no avail. War breaks out with substantial losses on each side, including Louis' reinforcements, who are drowned during the sea crossing. Many English nobles return to John's side after a dying French nobleman, Melun, warns them that Louis plans to kill them after his victory.John is poisoned by a disgruntled monk. His nobles gather around him as he dies. The Bastard plans the final assault on Louis' forces, until he is told that Pandolf has arrived with a peace treaty. The English nobles swear allegiance to John's son Prince Henry, and the Bastard reflects that this episode has taught that internal bickering could be as perilous to England's fortunes as foreign invasion.SourcesKing John is closely related to an anonymous history play, The Troublesome Reign of King John (c. 1589), the "masterly construction"  but infelicitous expression of which led Peter Alexander to argue that Shakespeare's was the earlier play.  Honigmann elaborated these arguments, both in his preface to the second Arden edition of King John,  and in his 1982 monograph on Shakespeare's influence on his contemporaries.  The majority view, however, first advanced in a rebuttal of Honigmann's views by Kenneth Muir,  holds that the Troublesome Reign antedates King John by a period of several years; and that the skilful plotting of the Troublesome Reign is neither unparalleled in the period, nor proof of Shakespeare's involvement. Shakespeare derived from Holinshed's Chronicles certain verbal collocations and points of action.  Honigmann discerned in the play the influence of John Foxe's Acts and Monuments, Matthew Paris' Historia Maior, and the Wakefield Chronicle,  but Muir demonstrated that this apparent influence could be explained by the priority of the Troublesome Reign, which contains similar or identical matter. Date and textThe date of composition is unknown, but must lie somewhere between 1587, the year of publication of the second, revised edition of Holinshed's Chronicles, upon which Shakespeare drew for this and other plays, and 1598, when King John was mentioned among Shakespeare's plays in the Palladis Tamia of Francis Meres.  The editors of the Oxford Shakespeare conclude from the play's incidence of rare vocabulary,  use of colloquialisms in verse,  pause patterns,  and infrequent rhyming that the play was composed in 1596, after Richard II but before Henry IV, Part I. King John is one of only two plays by Shakespeare that are entirely written in verse, the other being Richard II.Performance historyThe earliest known performance took place in 1737, when John Rich staged a production at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. In 1745, the year of the Jacobite rebellion, competing productions were staged by Colley Cibber at Covent Garden and David Garrick at Drury Lane. Charles Kemble's 1823 production made a serious effort at historical accuracy, inaugurating the 19th century tradition of striving for historical accuracy in Shakespearean production. Other successful productions of the play were staged by William Charles Macready (1842) and Charles Kean (1846). Twentieth century revivals include Robert B. Mantell's 1915 production (the last production to be staged on Broadway) and Peter Brook's 1945 staging, featuring Paul Scofield as the Bastard.In the Victorian era, King John was one of Shakespeare's most frequently staged plays, in part because its spectacle and pageantry were congenial to Victorian audiences. King John, however, has decreased in popularity: it is now one of Shakespeare's least-known plays and stagings of it are very rare.  It has been staged four times on Broadway, the last time in 1915.  It has also been staged five times from 1953 to 2014 at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival. Herbert Beerbohm Tree made a silent film version in 1899 entitled King John. It is a short film consisting of the King's death throes in Act V, Scene vii and is the earliest surviving film adaptation of a Shakespearean play. King John has been produced for television twice: in 1951 with Donald Wolfit and in 1984 with Leonard Rossiter as part of the BBC Television Shakespeare series of adaptations. George Orwell specifically praised it in 1942 for its view of politics: "When I had read it as a boy it seemed to me archaic, something dug out of a history book and not having anything to do with our own time. Well, when I saw it acted, what with its intrigues and doublecrossings, non-aggression pacts, quislings, people changing sides in the middle of a battle, and what-not, it seemed to me extraordinarily up to date."Selected modern revivalsThe Royal Shakespeare Company based in Stratford-upon-Avon presented two productions of King John: in 2006 directed by Josie Rourke as part of their Complete Works Festival  and in 2012 directed by Maria Aberg who cast a woman, Pippa Nixon, in the role of the Bastard.  The Company's 1974–5 production was heavily rewritten by director John Barton, who included material from The Troublesome Reign of King John, John Bale  King Johan (thought  to be Shakespeare's own sources) and other works.  In 2008, the Hudson Shakespeare Company of New Jersey produced King John as part of their annual Shakespeare in the Parks series. Director Tony White set the action in the medieval era but used a multi-ethnic and gender swapping cast. The roles of Constance and Dauphin Lewis were portrayed by African American actors Tzena Nicole Egblomasse and Jessie Steward and actresses Sharon Pinches and Allison Johnson were used in several male roles. Another notable departure for the production is the depiction of King John himself. Often portrayed as an ineffectual king, actor Jimmy Pravasilis portrayed a headstrong monarch sticking to his guns on his right to rule and his unwillingness to compromise became the result of his downfall. New York's Theater for a New Audience presented a "remarkable" in-the-round production in 2000, emphasising Faulconbridge's introduction to court realpolitik to develop the audience's own awareness of the characters' motives. The director was Karin Coonrod.  In 2012, Bard on the Beach  in Vancouver, British Columbia put on a production. It was also performed as part of the 2013 season at the Utah Shakespeare Festival, recipient of America's Outstanding Regional Theatre Tony Award (2000), presented by the American Theatre Wing and the League of American Theatres and Producers.The play was presented at Shakespeare's Globe, directed by James Dacre, as part of the summer season 2015 in the 800th anniversary year of Magna Carta.  A co-production with Royal & Derngate, this production also played in Salisbury Cathedral, Temple Church and The Holy Sepulchre, Northampton.The Rose Theatre, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey hosted Sir Trevor Nunn's direction of the play during May and June 2016, in the quatercentenary year of Shakespeare's death and the 800th anniversary year of King John's death.See alsoBlank verseIllegitimacy in fiction Notes Citations References    External links Complete Text of King John at MITThe life and death of King John – HTML version of this title.

Love's Labour's Lost<====>67015<====>Love's Labour's Lost   Love's Labour's Lost is one of William Shakespeare's early comedies, believed to have been written in the mid-1590s for a performance at the Inns of Court before Queen Elizabeth I.  It follows the King of Navarre and his three companions as they attempt to forswear the company of women for three years of study and fasting, and their subsequent infatuation with the Princess of France and her ladies.  In an untraditional ending for a comedy, the play closes with the death of the Princess's father, and all weddings are delayed for a year. 

Eugene O'Neill<====>67018<====>Eugene O'Neill  Eugene Gladstone O'Neill (October 16, 1888 – November 27, 1953) was an American playwright and Nobel laureate in Literature.  His poetically titled plays were among the first to introduce into American drama techniques of realism earlier associated with Russian playwright Anton Chekhov, Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen, and Swedish playwright August Strindberg.  The drama Long Day's Journey into Night is often numbered on the short list of the finest American plays in the 20th century, alongside Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire and Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman.  O'Neill's plays were among the first to include speeches in American vernacular and involve characters on the fringes of society. 

SSM-N-8 Regulus<====>67019<====>SSM-N-8 Regulus  The SSM-N-8A Regulus or the  Regulus I was a United States Navy-developed ship-and-submarine-launched, nuclear-capable turbojet-powered second generation cruise missile, deployed from 1955 to 1964.  Its development was an outgrowth of U. S.  Navy tests conducted with the German V-1 missile at Naval Air Station Point Mugu in California.   Its barrel-shaped fuselage resembled that of numerous fighter aircraft designs of the era, but without a cockpit.  Test articles of the Regulus were equipped with landing gear and could take off and land like an airplane.   When the missiles were deployed they were launched from a rail launcher, and equipped with a pair of Aerojet JATO bottles on the aft end of the fuselage. 

Lionel Barrymore<====>67022<====>Lionel Barrymore Lionel Barrymore (born Lionel Herbert Blythe; April 28, 1878 – November 15, 1954) was an American actor of stage, screen and radio as well as a film director.    He won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in A Free Soul (1931), and remains best known to modern audiences for the role of the villainous Mr.  Potter character in Frank Capra's 1946 film It's a Wonderful Life.  He is also particularly remembered as Ebenezer Scrooge in annual broadcasts of A Christmas Carol during his last two decades.  He is also known for playing Dr. 

Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement<====>67023<====>Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement  The Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( , abbreviated MRTA) was a Peruvian radical group which started in the early 1980s.  The group was led by Víctor Polay Campos until he was sentenced to 32 years imprisonment in 1992  and by Néstor Cerpa Cartolini ("Comrade Evaristo") until his death in 1997. The MRTA took its name in homage to Túpac Amaru II, an 18th-century rebel leader who was himself named after his ancestor Túpac Amaru, the last indigenous leader of the Inca people.  MRTA was designated a terrorist organization by the Peruvian government, the US Department of State and the European Parliament   but was later removed from the United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations on October 8, 2001. 

Arnold Schoenberg<====>67025<====>Arnold Schoenberg Arnold Franz Walter Schoenberg or Schönberg ( ;  ; 13 September 1874 13 July 1951) was an Austrian composer, music theorist, and painter.  He was associated with the expressionist movement in German poetry and art, and leader of the Second Viennese School.  With the rise of the Nazi Party, Schoenberg's works were labelled  degenerate music, because they were modernist, atonal and what even Paul Hindemith called "sonic orgies" and "decadent intellectual efforts"  .  He emigrated to the United States of America in 1934. Schoenberg's approach, both in terms of harmony and development, has been one of the most influential of 20th-century musical thought. 

Túpac Amaru<====>67027<====>Túpac Amaru   Túpac Amaru or Thupa Amaro (from Quechua: Tupaq Amaru)  (1545 – 24 September 1572) was the last indigenous monarch (Sapa Inca) of the Neo-Inca State, remnants of the Inca Empire in Vilcabamba, Peru.  He was executed by the Spanish.AccessionFollowing the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire in the 1530s, a few members of the royal family established the small independent Neo-Inca State in Vilcabamba, which was located in the relatively inaccessible Upper Amazon to the northeast of Cusco.  The founder of this state was Manco Inca Yupanqui (also known as Manco Cápac II), who had initially allied himself with the Spanish, then led an unsuccessful war against them before establishing himself in Vilcabamba in 1540. 

Umbrella<====>67028<====>UmbrellaAn umbrella or parasol is a folding canopy supported by wooden or metal ribs, which is usually mounted on a wooden, metal, or plastic pole.  It is designed to protect a person against rain or sunlight.  The word "umbrella" typically refers to a device used for protection from rain.  The word parasol usually refers to an item designed to protect from the sun.  Often the difference is the material used for the canopy; some parasols are not waterproof.  Umbrella canopies may be made of fabric or flexible plastic. Umbrellas and parasols are primarily hand-held portable devices sized for personal use. 

Passive solar building design<====>67029<====>Passive solar building design In passive solar building design, windows, walls, and floors are made to collect, store, and distribute solar energy in the form of heat in the winter and reject solar heat in the summer.  This is called passive solar design because, unlike active solar heating systems, it does not involve the use of mechanical and electrical devices.  The key to design a passive solar building is to best take advantage of the local climate performing an accurate site analysis.  Elements to be considered include window placement and size, and glazing type, thermal insulation, thermal mass, and shading. 

Errol Flynn<====>67030<====>Errol Flynn    Errol Leslie Flynn    (20 June 1909 – 14 October 1959)  was an Australian-born actor who achieved fame in Hollywood after 1935.    He was known for his romantic swashbuckler roles in Hollywood films, as well as frequent partnerships with Olivia de Havilland.  He became a U. S.  citizen in 1942. Early lifeErrol Leslie Flynn was born in Battery Point, a suburb of Hobart, Tasmania, where his father, Theodore, was a lecturer (1909) and later professor (1911) of biology at the University of Tasmania.  His mother was born Lily Mary Young, but shortly after marrying Theodore at St John's Church of England, Birchgrove, Sydney, on 23 January 1909,  she changed her first name to Marelle. 

Sarbanes–Oxley Act<====>67031<====>Sarbanes–Oxley Act  The Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 ( ), also known as the "Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act" (in the Senate) and "Corporate and Auditing Accountability, Responsibility, and Transparency Act" (in the House) and more commonly called Sarbanes–Oxley, Sarbox or SOX, is a United States federal law that set new or expanded requirements for all U. S.  public company boards, management and public accounting firms.  There are also a number of provisions of the Act that also apply to privately held companies, for example the willful destruction of evidence to impede a Federal investigation. 

USS Barbero (SS-317)<====>67032<====>USS Barbero (SS-317) }    USS Barbero (SS/SSA/SSG-317) was a Balao-class submarine of the United States Navy, named for a family of fishes commonly called surgeon fish. Barbero was laid by the Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut on 25 March 1943.  She was launched on 12 December 1943, sponsored by Mrs.  Katherine R.  Keating, and commissioned on 29 April 1944, Lieutenant Commander Irvin S.  Hartman in command. Service historyWorld War IIBarbero s war operations span the period from 9 August 1944– 2 January 1945, during which she completed two war patrols.  She is credited with sinking three Japanese merchant ships totaling 9,126 tons while patrolling in the Java and South China Seas. 

Active solar<====>67039<====>Active solar Solar hot water systems use pumps or fans to circulate fluid (often a mixture of water and glycol to prevent freezing during winter periods) or air, through solar collectors, and are therefore classified under active solar technology. Some of the basic benefits of active systems is that controls (usually electrical) can be used to maximize their effectiveness.  For example, a passive solar thermal array which does not rely on pumps and sensors will only start circulating when a certain amount of internal energy has built up in the system.  Using sensors and pumps, a relatively small amount of energy (i. 

Weatherization<====>67042<====>Weatherization Weatherization (American English) or weatherproofing (British English) is the practice of protecting a building and its interior from the elements, particularly from sunlight, precipitation, and wind, and of modifying a building to reduce energy consumption and optimize energy efficiency. Weatherization is distinct from building insulation, although building insulation requires weatherization for proper functioning.   Many types of insulation can be thought of as weatherization, because they block drafts or protect from cold winds.  Whereas insulation primarily reduces conductive heat flow, weatherization primarily reduces convective heat flow. In the United States, buildings use one third of all energy consumed and two thirds of all electricity. 

Thermal insulation<====>67043<====>Thermal insulationThermal insulation is the reduction of heat transfer (i. e.  the transfer of thermal energy between objects of differing temperature) between objects in thermal contact or in range of radiative influence.  Thermal insulation can be achieved with specially engineered methods or processes, as well as with suitable object shapes and materials. Heat flow is an inevitable consequence of contact between objects of different temperature.  Thermal insulation provides a region of insulation in which thermal conduction is reduced or thermal radiation is reflected rather than absorbed by the lower-temperature body. The insulating capability of a material is measured as this inverse of thermal conductivity (k). 

Thermal mass<====>67046<====>Thermal mass  In building design, thermal mass is a property of the mass of a building which enables it to store heat, providing "inertia" against temperature fluctuations.  It is sometimes known as the thermal flywheel effect.   For example, when outside temperatures are fluctuating throughout the day, a large thermal mass within the insulated portion of a house can serve to "flatten out" the daily temperature fluctuations, since the thermal mass will absorb thermal energy when the surroundings are higher in temperature than the mass, and give thermal energy back when the surroundings are cooler, without reaching thermal equilibrium. 

Soichiro Honda<====>67047<====>Soichiro Honda    was a Japanese engineer and industrialist.   "Honda Soichiro. " Encyclopædia Britannica.  Encyclopædia Britannica Online Library Edition.  Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. , 2011.  Web.  21 July 2011.    In 1948, he established Honda Motor Co. , Ltd.  and oversaw its expansion from a wooden shack manufacturing bicycle motors to a multinational automobile and motorcycle manufacturer.  Early yearsHonda was born in Tenryū, Shizuoka, a small village under Mount Fuji near Hamamatsu on November 17, 1906.  He spent his early childhood helping his father, Gihei, a blacksmith, with his bicycle repair business. 

Selaginella<====>67049<====>Selaginella  Selaginella is the sole genus of primitive vascular plants in the family Selaginellaceae, the spikemosses or lesser clubmosses.  This family is distinguished from Lycopodiaceae (the clubmosses) by having scale-leaves bearing a ligule and by having spores of two types.   They are sometimes included in an informal paraphyletic group called the "fern allies".  S.  moellendorffii is an important model organism.  Its genome has been sequenced by the United States Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute.   The name Selaginella was erected by Palisot de Beauvois solely for the species Selaginella selaginoides, which turns out (with the closely related Selaginella deflexa) to be a clade that is sister to all other Selaginellas, so any definitive subdivision of the species leaves two taxa in Selaginella, with the hundreds of other species in new or resurrected genera. 

Tutsi<====>67050<====>Tutsi The Tutsi ( ;   ), or Abatutsi, are an ethnic group inhabiting the African Great Lakes region.  Historically, they were often referred to as the Watutsi, Collins English Dictionary  Watusi,  Wahuma, Wahima or the Wahinda.  The Tutsi form a subgroup of the Banyarwanda and the Barundi peoples, who reside primarily in Rwanda and Burundi, but with significant populations also found in Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Tanzania.   They speak Rwanda-Rundi, a group of Bantu languages. The Tutsi are the second largest population division among the three largest groups in Rwanda and Burundi; the other two being the Hutu (largest) and the Twa (smallest). 

Nilotic peoples<====>67052<====>Nilotic peoples  Nilotic people are people indigenous to the Nile Valley who speak Nilotic languages, which constitute a large sub-group of the Nilo-Saharan languages spoken in South Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, and northern Tanzania.In a more general sense, the Nilotic peoples include all descendants of the original Nilo-Saharan speakers.  Among these are the Luo, Sara, Maasai, Kalenjin, Dinka, Nuer, Shilluk, Ateker, and the Maa-speaking peoples, each of which is a cluster of several ethnic groups.  The Nilotes constitute the majority of the population in South Sudan, an area that is believed to be their original point of dispersal. 

Iron Man<====>67055<====>Iron Man {{Infobox comics character and title }}Iron Man is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.  The character was created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby.  The character made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39 (cover dated March 1963). A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, and ingenious scientist, Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping in which his captors attempt to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction.  He instead creates a powered suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity. 

Thoracic cavity<====>67056<====>Thoracic cavity  The thoracic cavity (or chest cavity) is the chamber of the body of vertebrates that is protected by the thoracic wall (rib cage and associated skin, muscle, and fascia).  The central compartment of the thoracic cavity is the mediastinum.  There are two openings of the thoracic cavity, a superior thoracic aperture known as the thoracic inlet and a lower inferior thoracic aperture known as the thoracic outlet. The thoracic cavity includes the tendons as well as the cardiovascular system which could be damaged from injury to the back, spine or the neck. StructureStructures within the thoracic cavity include:structures of the cardiovascular system, including the heart and great vessels, which include the thoracic aorta, the pulmonary artery and all its branches, the superior and inferior vena cava, the pulmonary veins, and the azygos vein structures of the respiratory system, including the Diaphragm, trachea, bronchi and lungs structures of the digestive system, including the esophagus,endocrine glands, including the thymus gland,structures of the nervous system including the paired vagus nerves, and the paired sympathetic chains,lymphatics including the thoracic duct. 

Abdominal cavity<====>67058<====>Abdominal cavity The abdominal cavity is a large body cavity in humans    and many other animals that contains many organs.  It is a part of the abdominopelvic cavity.It is located below the thoracic cavity, and above the pelvic cavity.  Its dome-shaped roof is the thoracic diaphragm, a thin sheet of muscle under the lungs, and its floor is the pelvic inlet, opening into the pelvis.  The abdominal cavity of humans is divided into 4 quadrants: the right upper quadrant (RUQ), the left upper quadrant (LUQ), the right lower quadrant (RLQ) and the left lower quadrant (LLQ). 

Hot spring<====>67060<====>Hot spring  A hot spring is a spring produced by the emergence of geothermally heated groundwater that rises from the Earth's crust.  There are geothermal hot springs in many locations all over the crust of the earth.  While some of these springs contain water that is a safe temperature for bathing, others are so hot that immersion can result in injury or death. Definitions There is no universally accepted definition of a hot spring.  For example, one can find the phrase hot spring defined as any geothermal spring a spring with water temperatures above its surroundings a natural spring with water temperature above body temperature – normally between   a natural spring with warm water above body temperature a thermal spring with water warmer than    a natural spring of water greater than   (synonymous with thermal spring)    a natural discharge of groundwater with elevated temperatures a type of thermal spring in which hot water is brought to the surface. 

Pastry<====>67062<====>Pastry  Pastry is a dough of flour, water and shortening that may be savoury or sweetened.  Sweetened pastries are often described as bakers' confectionery.  The word "pastries" suggests many kinds of baked products made from ingredients such as flour, sugar, milk, butter, shortening, baking powder, and eggs.  Small tarts and other sweet baked products are called pastries.  The French word pâtisserie is also used in English (with or without the accent) for the same foods.  Common pastry dishes include pies, tarts, quiches and pasties.   Pastry can also refer to the pastry dough,    from which such baked products are made. 

Rose water<====>67064<====>Rose water   Rose water ( ; golāb) is a flavoured water made by steeping rose petals in water.  Additionally, it is the hydrosol portion of the distillate of rose petals, a by-product of the production of rose oil for use in perfume.  It is used to flavour food, as a component in some cosmetic and medical preparations, and for religious purposes throughout Europe and Asia.  Rose syrup (not to be confused with rose hip syrup) is made from rose water, with sugar added. In Iran, India and other countries in the Indian Subcontinent: Gulab; refers to (Gul- Flower) and (Ab- Water) in the Persian language. 

Word-sense disambiguation<====>67065<====>Word-sense disambiguation  In computational linguistics, word-sense disambiguation (WSD) is an open problem of natural language processing and ontology.  WSD is identifying which sense of a word (i. e.  meaning) is used in a sentence, when the word has multiple meanings.  The solution to this problem impacts other computer-related writing, such as discourse, improving relevance of search engines, anaphora resolution, coherence, inference, et cetera. The human brain is quite proficient at word-sense disambiguation.  That natural language is formed in a way that requires so much of it is a reflection of that neurologic reality.  In other words, human language developed in a way that reflects (and also has helped to shape) the innate ability provided by the brain's neural networks. 

Satellite radio<====>67066<====>Satellite radio Satellite radio is defined by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)'S ITU Radio Regulations (RR) as a broadcasting-satellite service.   The satellite's signals are broadcast nationwide, across a much wider geographical area than terrestrial radio stations, and the service is primarily intended for the occupants of motor vehicles.   It is available by subscription, mostly commercial free, and offers subscribers more stations and a wider variety of programming options than terrestrial radio.  Satellite radio technology was inducted into the Space Foundation Space Technology Hall of Fame in 2002.Satellite radio uses the 2. 

Staggers Rail Act<====>67067<====>Staggers Rail Act The Staggers Rail Act of 1980 is a United States federal law that deregulated the American railroad industry to a significant extent, and it replaced the regulatory structure that had existed since the 1887 Interstate Commerce Act.  BackgroundIn the aftermath of the Great Depression and World War II, many railroads were driven out of business by competition from the Interstate highways and airlines.  The rise of the automobile led to the end of passenger train service on most railroads.  Trucking businesses had become major competitors by the 1930s with the advent of improved paved roads, and after the war, they expanded their operations as the highway network grew and acquired increased market share of cargo business. 

Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act<====>67068<====>Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act The Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976,  , often called the "4R Act," is a United States federal law that established the basic outlines of regulatory reform in the railroad industry and provided transitional operating funds following the 1970 bankruptcy of Penn Central Transportation Company.   The law approved the "Final System Plan" for the newly created Conrail and authorized acquisition of Northeast Corridor tracks and facilities by Amtrak. The Act was the first in a series of laws which collectively are described as the deregulation of transportation in the United States. 

Wesley Crusher<====>67069<====>Wesley Crusher Wesley Crusher is a fictional character in the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation, appearing regularly in the first four seasons and sporadically afterward.  He is the son of Beverly Crusher and Jack Crusher and is portrayed by actor Wil Wheaton. OverviewTelevision series and filmsIn the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation, Wesley Crusher first arrives on the Enterprise-D with his mother, soon after Captain Jean-Luc Picard assumes command.  Crusher's father was killed while under Picard's command, with Picard delivering the message to Wesley and to his mother, Beverly.  Picard initially found Wesley irritating, as he is often uncomfortable around all children, a fact which he discloses to his first officer, Commander William Riker, in the pilot episode "Encounter at Farpoint". 

Tasha Yar<====>67072<====>Tasha Yar  Natasha "Tasha" Yar is a fictional character that mainly appeared in the first season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek: The Next Generation.  Portrayed by Denise Crosby, she is chief of security aboard the Starfleet starship USS Enterprise-D and carries the rank of lieutenant.  The character's concept was originally based upon the character of Vasquez from the 1986 film Aliens.  Following further development she became known first as Tanya, and then Tasha.  Crosby had originally auditioned for the role of Deanna Troi, while Rosalind Chao became a favorite for Tasha. 

Ro Laren<====>67073<====>Ro Laren   Ro Laren is a fictional character who appears on a recurring basis in the fifth, sixth and seventh seasons of the American science fiction television series Star Trek: The Next Generation.  Portrayed by Michelle Forbes, she is a member of the Bajoran race who joins the crew of the USS Enterprise-D over the fervent objection of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), who cited her previous court-martial.   Ro, too, was against joining the Enterprise crew, but said "it is better than prison. " The character was intended both to be at odds with the series regulars and to replace Wesley Crusher at the conn officer post on the bridge. 

Isoetes<====>67075<====>Isoetes Isoetes, commonly known as the quillworts, is a genus of plants in the class Isoetopsida and order Isoetales.  They are lycopods and the only genus in Isoetaceae.  There are currently 192 recognized species,    with a cosmopolitan distribution but often scarce to rare.  Some botanists split the genus, separating two South American species into the genus Stylites, although molecular data place these species among other species of Isoetes, so Stylites does not warrant taxonomic recognition.    The name of the genus may also be spelled Isoëtes.  The diaeresis (two dots over the e) indicate that the o and the e are to be pronounced in two distinct syllables. 

Equisetum<====>67077<====>Equisetum  Equisetum ( ; horsetail, snake grass, puzzlegrass) is the only living genus in Equisetaceae, a family of vascular plants that reproduce by spores rather than seeds.  Equisetum is a "living fossil" as it is the only living genus of the entire class Equisetopsida, which for over one hundred million years was much more diverse and dominated the understory of late Paleozoic forests.  Some Equisetopsida were large trees reaching to 30 meters tall.   The genus Calamites of the family Calamitaceae, for example, is abundant in coal deposits from the Carboniferous period. A superficially similar but entirely unrelated flowering plant genus, mare's tail (Hippuris), is occasionally referred to as "horsetail", and adding to confusion, the name mare's tail is sometimes applied to Equisetum. 

Anzac biscuit<====>67079<====>Anzac biscuit An Anzac biscuit is a sweet biscuit, popular in Australia and New Zealand, made using rolled oats, flour, sugar, butter (or margarine), golden syrup, baking soda, boiling water, and (optionally) desiccated coconut.   Anzac biscuits have long been associated with the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) established in World War I. The biscuits were sent by wives and women's groups to soldiers abroad because the ingredients do not spoil easily and the biscuits kept well during naval transportation.   Today, Anzac biscuits are manufactured commercially for retail sale. Biscuits issued to soldiers by the Army, referred to as "Anzac tiles" or "Anzac wafers", differ from the popular Anzac biscuit.

Lamington<====>67083<====>Lamington    A lamington is an Australian cake, made from squares of sponge cake coated in an outer layer of chocolate (or sometimes raspberry) sauce and rolled in desiccated coconut.  The thin mixture is absorbed into the outside of the sponge cake and left to set, giving the cake a distinctive texture.   A common variation has a layer of cream or strawberry jam between two lamington halves.    OriginsMaurice French, an emeritus professor of history at the University of Southern Queensland, who has examined the question in depth,    believes that it is certain that lamingtons were named after either Lord Lamington, who served as Governor of Queensland from 1896 to 1901, or his wife, Lady Lamington. 

Transphobia<====>67084<====>Transphobia   Transphobia is a range of negative attitudes, feelings or actions toward transgender or transsexual people, or toward transsexuality.  Transphobia can be emotional disgust, fear, violence, anger or discomfort felt or expressed towards people who do not conform to society's gender expectations. It is often expressed alongside homophobic views and hence is often considered an aspect of homophobia.   Transphobia is a type of prejudice and discrimination similar to racism and sexism,  and transgender people of color are often subjected to all three forms of discrimination at once. 

409 BC<====>67087<====>409 BC    Year 409 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.  At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Cossus and Medullinus (or, less frequently, year 345 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 409 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. Events By placeGreeceAlcibiades recaptures Byzantium, ending the city's rebellion from Athens.  This action completes Athenian control of the Bosporus which secures the Athenian supply route for grain from the Bosporan Kingdom in the Black Sea region. 

Conservation of energy<====>67088<====>Conservation of energy  In physics, the law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant — it is said to be conserved over time.In other words, this law means that energy can neither be created nor destroyed; rather, it can only be transformed from one form to another.  For instance, chemical energy is converted to kinetic energy when a stick of dynamite explodes.  If one adds up all the forms of energy that were released in the explosion, such as the kinetic energy of the pieces, as well as heat and sound, one will get the exact decrease of chemical energy in the combustion of the dynamite. 

Magnoliopsida<====>67111<====>Magnoliopsida  Magnoliopsida is a valid botanical name for a class of flowering plants.   By definition the class will include the family Magnoliaceae, but its   can otherwise vary, being more inclusive or less inclusive depending upon the classification system being discussed. Cronquist and Takhtajan systemsIn the Takhtajan system and the Cronquist system the name was used for the group known as dicotyledons. Magnoliopsida in the Takhtajan systemThe Takhtajan system used this internal taxonomy:class Magnoliopsida [= dicotyledons]subclass Magnoliidaesubclass Nymphaeidaesubclass Nelumbonidaesubclass Ranunculidaesubclass Caryophyllidaesubclass Hamamelididaesubclass Dilleniidaesubclass Rosidaesubclass Cornidaesubclass Asteridaesubclass LamiidaeMagnoliopsida in the Cronquist systemThe Cronquist system used this internal taxonomy (in the 1981 version):class Magnoliopsida [= dicotyledons]subclass Magnoliidaesubclass Hamamelidaesubclass Caryophyllidaesubclass Dilleniidaesubclass Rosidaesubclass AsteridaeDahlgren and Thorne systemsThe Dahlgren system and the Thorne system (1992) used the name Magnoliopsida for the flowering plants (angiosperms). 

Donovan Bailey<====>67116<====>Donovan Bailey Donovan Bailey (born December 16, 1967) is a retired Canadian sprinter, who once held the world record for the 100 metres.   He recorded a time of 9. 84 seconds to win the gold medal at the 1996 Olympic Games.  He was the first Canadian to legally break the 10-second barrier in the 100 m.  Particularly noted for his top speed, Bailey ran   in his 1996 Olympic title run, the fastest ever recorded by a human at the time.   In 2005, Donovan Bailey was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame. 

Linford Christie<====>67118<====>Linford Christie   Linford Cicero Christie OBE (born 2 April 1960) is a Jamaican-born British former sprinter.  He is the only British man to have won gold medals in the 100 metres at all four major competitions open to British athletes: the Olympic Games, the World Championships, the European Championships and the Commonwealth Games.  He was the first European to break the 10-second barrier in the 100 m and still holds the British record in the event.  He is a former world indoor record holder over 200 metres, and a former European record holder in the 60 metres, 100 m and 4 × 100 metres relay. 

National Front (France)<====>67119<====>National Front (France) The National Front ( ,  ; FN) is a right-wing populist  and nationalist  political party in France.  Most political commentators place the FN on the  far-right but other sources suggest that the party's position on the political spectrum has become more difficult to define clearly.  Difficult to define:Arthur Goldhammer (2015).  "Explaining the Rise of the Front National: Political Rhetoric or Cultural Insecurity?"

Liliopsida<====>67126<====>LiliopsidaLiliopsida  Batsch  (synonym: Liliatae)  is a botanical name for the class containing the family Liliaceae (or Lily Family).  It is considered synonymous (or nearly synonymous) with the name monocotyledon.  Publication of the name is credited to Scopoli (in 1760): see author citation (botany).  This name is formed by replacing the termination -aceae in the name Liliaceae by the termination -opsida (Art 16 of the ICBN). Although in principle it is true that circumscription of this class will vary with the taxonomic system being used, in practice this name is very strongly linked to the Cronquist system, and the allied Takhtajan system.

Carlos Castaneda<====>67129<====>Carlos Castaneda   Carlos Castaneda (December 25, 1925  April 27, 1998) was an American author with a Ph. D.  in anthropology. Starting with The Teachings of Don Juan in 1968, Castaneda wrote a series of books that describe his training in shamanism, particularly with a group whose lineage descended from the Toltecs.  The books, narrated in the first person, relate his experiences under the tutelage of a Yaqui "Man of Knowledge" named don Juan Matus.  His 12 books have sold more than 28 million copies in 17 languages.  Critics have suggested that they are works of fiction; supporters claim the books are either true or at least valuable works of philosophy and descriptions of practices which lead one to an awareness of energies, beings and worlds which lie outside the perceptual paradigm of the vast majority of human beings on this planet.

Colossus of Rhodes<====>67143<====>Colossus of Rhodes  The Colossus of Rhodes   ( )  was a statue of the Greek titan-god of the sun Helios, erected in the city of Rhodes, on the Greek island of the same name, by Chares of Lindos in 280 BC.  One of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, it was constructed to celebrate Rhodes' victory over the ruler of Cyprus, Antigonus I Monophthalmus, whose son unsuccessfully besieged Rhodes in 305 BC.  According to most contemporary descriptions, the Colossus stood approximately 70 cubits, or   high—the approximate height of the modern Statue of Liberty from feet to crown—making it the tallest statue of the ancient world. 

Neuro-linguistic programming<====>67147<====>Neuro-linguistic programmingNeuro-linguistic programming (NLP) is an approach to communication, personal development, and psychotherapy created by Richard Bandler and John Grinder in California, United States in the 1970s.  NLP's creators claim there is a connection between neurological processes (neuro-), language (linguistic) and behavioral patterns learned through experience (programming), and that these can be changed to achieve specific goals in life.  Tosey, P.  & Mathison, J. , (2006) "Introducing Neuro-Linguistic Programming. " Centre for Management Learning & Development, School of Management, University of Surrey.

Régine Deforges<====>67149<====>Régine Deforges   Régine Deforges (15 August 1935 – 3 April 2014) was a French author, editor, director, and playwright.  Born in Montmorillon, Vienne, Deforges is sometimes called the High Priestess of French erotic literature.  Deforges was the first woman to own and operate a publishing house in France.  Over the years, she has been censored, prosecuted, and heavily fined for publishing "offensive" literature (Louis Aragon: Irene's Cunt).   One of her novels, La Bicyclette bleue (The Blue Bicycle), published in 1981, was France's biggest bestseller.  In 2000, it was made into a television series. 

Socionics<====>67152<====>Socionics  Socionics, in psychology and sociology, is a theory of information processing and personality type, distinguished by its information model of the psyche (called "Model A") and a model of interpersonal relations.  It incorporates Carl Jung's work on Psychological Types with Antoni Kępiński's theory of information metabolism.  Socionics is a modification of Jung's personality type theory that uses eight psychic functions, in contrast to Jung's model, which used only four.  These functions are supposed to process information at varying levels of competency and interact with the corresponding function in other individuals, giving rise to predictable reactions and impressions—a theory of intertype relations. 

Kamehameha I<====>67156<====>Kamehameha I Kamehameha I ( ;   –  May 8 or 14, 1819  ), also known as Kamehameha the Great, (full Hawaiian name: Kalani Pai ea Wohi o Kaleikini Keali ikui Kamehameha o  Iolani i Kaiwikapu kau i Ka Liholiho Kūnuiākea) was the founder and first ruler of the Kingdom of Hawaii.

Red blood cell<====>67158<====>Red blood cellRed blood cells (RBCs), also called erythrocytes, are the most common type of blood cell and the vertebrate's principal means of delivering oxygen (O 2 ) to the body tissues—via blood flow through the circulatory system.    RBCs take up oxygen in the lungs, or gills of fish, and release it into tissues while squeezing through the body's capillaries. The cytoplasm of erythrocytes is rich in hemoglobin, an iron-containing biomolecule that can bind oxygen and is responsible for the red color of the cells.  The cell membrane is composed of proteins and lipids, and this structure provides properties essential for physiological cell function such as deformability and stability while traversing the circulatory system and specifically the capillary network. 

Blood cell<====>67159<====>Blood cell   A blood cell, also called a haematopoietic cell, hemocyte, or hematocyte, is a cell produced through hematopoiesis and found mainly in the blood.  Red blood cells – ErythrocytesWhite blood cells – LeukocytesPlatelets – Thrombocytes. Together, these three kinds of blood cells add up to a total 45% of the blood tissue by volume, with the remaining 55% of the volume composed of plasma, the liquid component of blood.  The volume percentage of red blood cells in the blood (hematocrit) is measured by centrifuge or flow cytometry and is 45% of cells to total volume in males and 45% in females.

Life datesApollonius was born into a respected and wealthy Greek family.   Although the precise dates of his birth and death are uncertain, most scholars agree that he was a contemporary of Jesus of Nazareth.  His primary biographer, Philostratus the Elder (circa 170 c.  247), places him circa 3 B. C.  c. 

Placenta<====>67166<====>Placenta  The placenta is an organ that connects the developing fetus to the uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake, thermo-regulation, waste elimination, and gas exchange via the mother's blood supply; to fight against internal infection; and to produce hormones which support pregnancy.  The placenta provides oxygen and nutrients to growing fetuses and removes waste products from the fetus's blood.  The placenta attaches to the wall of the uterus, and the fetus's umbilical cord develops from the placenta.  These organs connect the mother and the fetus.   Placentas are a defining characteristic of placental mammals, but are also found in marsupials and some non-mammals with varying levels of development. 

Chymosin<====>67167<====>Chymosin  Chymosin   or rennin   is a protease found in rennet.  It is an aspartic endopeptidase belonging to MEROPS A1 family.  It is produced by newborn ruminant animals in the lining of the abomasum to curdle the milk they ingest, allowing a longer residence in the bowels and better absorption.   It is widely used in the production of cheese.   Bovine chymosin is now produced recombinantly in  , Aspergillus niger var awamori, and   as alternative resource. OccurrenceChymosin is produced by ruminant animals in the lining of the abomasum. 

Beta-galactosidase<====>67168<====>Beta-galactosidase  β-galactosidase, also called lactase, beta-gal or β-gal, is a glycoside hydrolase enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of β-galactosides into monosaccharides through the breaking of a glycosidic bond.  β-galactosides include carbohydrates containing galactose where the glycosidic bond lies above the galactose molecule.  Substrates of different β-galactosidases include ganglioside GM1, lactosylceramides, lactose, and various glycoproteins.    Properties and functionsβ-galactosidase is an exoglycosidase which hydrolyzes the β-glycosidic bond formed between a galactose and its organic moiety.  It may also cleave fucosides and arabinosides but with much lower efficiency.   It is an essential enzyme in the human body. 

Placentalia<====>67171<====>Placentalia  Placentalia ("Placentals") is one of the three extant subdivisions of the class of animals Mammalia; the other two are Monotremata and Marsupialia.  The Placentals are partly distinguishable from other mammals in that the fetus is carried in the uterus of its mother to a relatively late stage of development.  It is somewhat of a misnomer since marsupials also nourish their fetuses via a placenta.    Anatomical featuresPlacental mammals are anatomically distinguished from other mammals by:a sufficiently wide opening at the bottom of the pelvis to allow the birth of a large baby relative to the size of the mother. 

World Trade Center site<====>67173<====>World Trade Center site    The World Trade Center site, formerly known as "Ground Zero" after the September 11 attacks, is a 14. 6-acre (5. 9 ha) area in Lower Manhattan in New York City.

A copyright lawsuit between System Enhancement Associates (SEA) and Katz's company, PKWARE, Inc. , was widely publicized in the BBS community in the late 1980s.  Phil Katz's software business was very successful, but he struggled with social isolation and chronic alcoholism in the last years of his life. CareerPhil Katz graduated from the Computer Science Engineering program at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. 

Testicle<====>67193<====>Testicle   The testicle or testis is the male reproductive gland in all animals, including humans.  It is homologous to the female ovary.  The functions of the testes are to produce both sperm and androgens, primarily testosterone.  Testosterone release is controlled by the anterior pituitary luteinizing hormone; whereas sperm production is controlled both by the anterior pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone and gonadal testosterone. StructureAppearanceMales have two testicles of similar size contained within the scrotum, which is an extension of the abdominal wall.  Scrotal asymmetry is not unusual: one testicle extends further down into the scrotum than the other due to differences in the anatomy of the vasculature. 

Desegregation<====>67203<====>Desegregation  Desegregation is the process of ending the separation of two groups usually referring to races.  This is most commonly used in reference to the United States.  Desegregation was long a focus of the Civil Rights Movement, both before and after the United States Supreme Court's decision in Brown v.  Board of Education, particularly desegregation of the school systems and the military (see Military history of African Americans).  Racial integration of society was a closely related goal. In the U. S.  militaryEarly historyStarting with King Philip's War in the 17th century, blacks served alongside whites in an integrated environment in the North American colonies. 

Ophioglossum<====>67210<====>Ophioglossum Ophioglossum, the adder's-tongue ferns, is a genus of about 25–30 species of ferns in the family Ophioglossaceae, of the order Ophioglossales.   The name Ophioglossum comes from the Greek, and means "snake-tongue".  eFloras: Ophioglossum .  accessed 2. 14. 2014.  Their cosmopolitan distribution is mainly in tropical and subtropical habitats.  DescriptionAdders-tongues are so-called because the spore-bearing stalk is thought to resemble a snake's tongue.  Each plant typically sends up a small, undivided leaf blade with netted venation, and the spore stalk forks from the leaf stalk, terminating in sporangia which are partially concealed within a structure with slitted sides. 

Electron configuration<====>67211<====>Electron configurationIn atomic physics and quantum chemistry, the electron configuration is the distribution of electrons of an atom or molecule (or other physical structure) in atomic or molecular orbitals.For example, the electron configuration of the neon atom is 1s 2  2s 2  2p 6 . Electronic configurations describe each electron as moving independently in an orbital, in an average field created by all other orbitals.  Mathematically, configurations are described by Slater determinants or configuration state functions. According to the laws of quantum mechanics, for systems with only one electron, an energy is associated with each electron configuration and, upon certain conditions, electrons are able to move from one configuration to another by the emission or absorption of a quantum of energy, in the form of a photon.

Melchiorre Murenu<====>67215<====>Melchiorre Murenu   Melchiorre Murenu (Macomer 1803 – 1854) was a blind Sardinian poet.  Melchiorre Murenu, "Tutte le Poesie", Edizioni della Torre, 1990.  Melchiorre Murenu is known as the "Homer of Sardinia"  because (just like the great Greek poet) he was blind and lived his entire life for poetry. He was born in Macomer where he lived his entire life.  At the age of three he became blind because of smallpox.  Murenu's father was imprisoned when Melchiorre was ten years old, and is thought to have died during his imprisonment.  This unfortunate circumstance drove Murenu's family in poverty (Murenu spoke of the difficult times of his childhood in the poem Supplica a Monsignore Bua). 

Martian meteorite<====>67216<====>Martian meteorite  A Martian meteorite is a rock that formed on the planet Mars and was then ejected from Mars by the impact of an asteroid or comet, and finally landed on the Earth.  Of over 61,000 meteorites that have been found on Earth, 132 were identified as Martian  .   These meteorites are thought to be from Mars because they have elemental and isotopic compositions that are similar to rocks and atmosphere gases analyzed by spacecraft on Mars.On October 17, 2013, NASA reported, based on analysis of argon in the Martian atmosphere by the Mars Curiosity rover, that certain meteorites found on Earth thought to be from Mars were indeed from Mars. 

Foreskin restoration<====>67220<====>Foreskin restorationForeskin restoration is the process of expanding the skin on the penis to reconstruct an organ immensely similar to the foreskin, which has been removed by circumcision or other injury. Foreskin restoration is primarily accomplished through non-surgical methods by stretching the residual skin of the penis, but surgical methods also exist. HistoryForeskin restoration is of ancient origin and dates back to the reign of Emperor Tiberius, when surgical means were taken to lengthen the foreskin of individuals with either a short foreskin that did not cover the glans completely or a completely exposed glans as a result of circumcision.

Disk read-and-write head<====>67310<====>Disk read-and-write head Disk read/write heads are the small parts of a disk drive which move above the disk platter and transform the platter's magnetic field into electrical current (read the disk) or, vice versa, transform electrical current into magnetic field (write the disk).    The heads have gone through a number of changes over the years. DescriptionIn a hard drive, the heads 'fly' above the disk surface with clearance of as little as 3 nanometres.   The "flying height" is constantly decreasing to enable higher areal density.  The flying height of the head is controlled by the design of an air-bearing etched onto the disk-facing surface of the slider.

Economy of Anguilla<====>67325<====>Economy of Anguilla The economy of Anguilla, which has few natural resources, depends heavily on luxury tourism, offshore banking, lobster fishing, and remittances from emigrants.  Due to its small size and reliance on tourism and foreign direct investment, Anguilla is vulnerable to external economic conditions in the United States and Europe.  Therefore, economic growth in Anguilla can be very volatile. History  In the 19th century, Anguilla's major product was salt produced by evaporation on the shores of the island's lakes, which was exported to the United States.    Sugar, cotton, corn, and tobacco were also grown.

Economic history of Argentina<====>67340<====>Economic history of Argentina The economic history of Argentina is one of the most studied, owing to the "Argentine paradox", its unique condition as a country that had achieved advanced development in the early 20th century but experienced a reversal, which inspired an enormous wealth of literature and diverse analysis on the causes of this decline.  Argentina possesses definite comparative advantages in agriculture, as the country is endowed with a vast amount of highly fertile land.   Between 1860 and 1930, exploitation of the rich land of the pampas strongly pushed economic growth.   During the first three decades of the 20th century, Argentina outgrew Canada and Australia in population, total income, and per capita income.

HistoryFrom isolation to nationhood Owing to its geographical remoteness, local authorities in what is today Argentina developed an early sense of autonomy.  Based largely on economic needs, during colonial times their pragmatism led to a flourishing unofficial market in smuggled goods, out of the then-small port of Buenos Aires, in blatant contravention of the Spanish mercantilist laws.

Absolute monarchy<====>67366<====>Absolute monarchy  Absolute monarchy, or despotic monarchy,   is a form of monarchy in which one ruler has supreme authority and where that authority is not restricted by any written laws, legislature, or customs.These are often, but not always, hereditary monarchies.  In contrast, in constitutional monarchies, the head of state's authority derives from and is legally bounded or restricted by a constitution or legislature.  Some monarchies have weak or symbolic legislatures and other governmental bodies the monarch can alter or dissolve at will.  Countries where monarchs still maintain absolute power are: Brunei,    Oman,    Saudi Arabia,  Swaziland,    Vatican City    and the individual emirates composing the United Arab Emirates, which itself is a free association of such monarchies – a federal monarchy. 

Mbox<====>67367<====>Mbox Mbox is a generic term for a family of related file formats used for holding collections of email messages, first implemented for Fifth Edition Unix. All messages in an mbox mailbox are concatenated and stored as plain text in a single file. Each message starts with the four characters "From" followed by a space (the so named "From_ line") and the sender's email address. RFC 4155 defines that a UTC timestamp follows after another separating space character. Unlike the Internet protocols used for the exchange of email, the format used for the storage of email has never been formally defined through the RFC standardization mechanism and has been entirely left to the developer of an email client.

Ulam spiral<====>67378<====>Ulam spiralThe Ulam spiral or prime spiral (in other languages also called the Ulam cloth) is a graphical depiction of the set of prime numbers, devised by mathematician Stanislaw Ulam in 1963 and popularized in Martin Gardner's Mathematical Games column in Scientific American a short time later.    It is constructed by writing the positive integers in a square spiral and specially marking the prime numbers. Ulam and Gardner emphasized the striking appearance in the spiral of prominent diagonal, horizontal, and vertical lines containing large numbers of primes.  Both Ulam and Gardner noted that the existence of such prominent lines is not unexpected, as lines in the spiral correspond to quadratic polynomials, and certain such polynomials, such as Euler's prime-generating polynomial x 2  − x + 41, are believed to produce a high density of prime numbers. 

Franz Liszt<====>67379<====>Franz Liszt  Franz Liszt ( ;  , in modern usage Liszt Ferenc,  ; Liszt's Hungarian passport spelt his given name as "Ferencz".  An orthographic reform of the Hungarian language in 1922 (which was 36 years after Liszt's death) changed the letter "cz" to simply "c" in all words except surnames; this has led to Liszt's given name being rendered in modern Hungarian usage as "Ferenc".  From 1859 to 1867 he was officially Franz Ritter von Liszt; he was created a Ritter (knight) by Emperor Francis Joseph I in 1859, but never used this title of nobility in public.

Synonym<====>67396<====>Synonym  A synonym is a word or phrase that means exactly or nearly the same as another word or phrase in the same language.  Words that are synonyms are said to be synonymous, and the state of being a synonym is called synonymy.   For example, the words begin, start, commence, and initiate are all synonyms of one another.  Words are typically synonymous in one particular sense: for example, long and extended in the context long time or extended time are synonymous, but long cannot be used in the phrase extended family.  Synonyms with the exact same meaning share a seme or denotational sememe, whereas those with inexactly similar meanings share a broader denotational or connotational sememe and thus overlap within a semantic field.

Second Viennese School<====>67457<====>Second Viennese SchoolThe Second Viennese School ( ) is the group of composers that comprised Arnold Schoenberg and his pupils and close associates in early 20th century Vienna, where he lived and taught, sporadically, between 1903 and 1925.  Their music was initially characterized by late-Romantic expanded tonality and later, following Schoenberg's own evolution, a totally chromatic expressionism without firm tonal centre, often referred to as atonality; and later still, Schoenberg's serial twelve-tone technique.  Though this common development took place, it neither followed a common time-line nor a cooperative path.  Likewise, it was not a direct result of Schoenberg's teaching—which, as his various published textbooks demonstrate, was highly traditional and conservative. 

Coalbed methane extraction<====>67458<====>Coalbed methane extractionCoalbed methane extraction (CBM extraction) is a method for extracting methane from a coal deposit. Basic principlesMethane adsorbed into a solid coal matrix (coal macerals) will be released if the coal seam is depressurised.   Methane may be extracted by drilling wells into the coal seam.  The goal is to decrease the water pressure by pumping water from the well.   The decrease in pressure allows methane to desorb from the coal and flow as a gas up the well to the surface.  Methane is then compressed and piped to market. The objective is to avoid putting methane into the water line, but allow it to flow up the backside of the well (casing) to the compressor station.

Left Right in France and main political partiesSince the 1789 French Revolution, the political spectrum in France has obeyed the left–right distinction.  However, due to the historical association of the term droite (right) with monarchism, conservative or right-wing parties have tended to avoid officially describing themselves as representing the "right wing". Contemporary French politics are characterised by two politically opposed groupings: one left-wing, centred on the French Socialist Party, and the other right-wing, centred previously around the Rassemblement pour la République (RPR) and now its successor the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP).

Unbinilium<====>67491<====>Unbinilium Unbinilium, also known as eka-radium or simply element 120, is the hypothetical chemical element in the periodic table with symbol Ubn and atomic number 120.  Unbinilium and Ubn are the temporary systematic IUPAC name and symbol, until a permanent name is decided upon.  In the periodic table of the elements, it is expected to be an s-block element, an alkaline earth metal, and the second element in the eighth period.  It has attracted attention because of some predictions that it may be in the island of stability, although newer calculations expect the island to actually occur at a slightly lower atomic number, closer to copernicium and flerovium. 

Ununennium<====>67492<====>Ununennium Ununennium, also known as eka-francium or simply element 119, is the hypothetical chemical element with symbol Uue and atomic number 119.

Religious commemoration and thanksgiving for good harvests are blended in events that take place in autumn, such as Halloween in the northern hemisphere and Easter in the southern. Festivals often serve to fulfill specific communal purposes, especially in regard to commemoration or thanksgiving. 

Werwolf<====>67502<====>Werwolf  Werwolf ( , German for "werewolf") was a Nazi plan, which began development in 1944,  to create a resistance force which would operate behind enemy lines as the Allies advanced through Germany.  Ultimately, Werwolf's propaganda value far outweighed its actual achievements. NomenclatureThe name was chosen  after the title of Hermann Löns' novel, Der Wehrwolf, first published in 1910.Set in the Celle region (Lower Saxony) during the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648), the novel concerns a peasant named Harm Wulf.  After marauding soldiers kill his family, Wulf organises his neighbours into a militia who pursue the soldiers mercilessly and execute any they capture, while referring to themselves as Wehrwölfe. 

Zuiderzee Works<====>67503<====>Zuiderzee WorksThe Zuiderzee Works ( ) is a man-made system of dams and dikes, land reclamation and water drainage work, in total the largest hydraulic engineering project undertaken by the Netherlands during the twentieth century.  The project involved the damming of the Zuiderzee, a large, shallow inlet of the North Sea, and the reclamation of land in the newly enclosed water using polders.  Its main purposes are to improve flood protection and create additional land for agriculture. The American Society of Civil Engineers declared these works, together with the Delta Works in the South-West of the Netherlands, as among the Seven Wonders of the Modern World . 

Palais Garnier<====>67505<====>Palais Garnier   The Palais Garnier (  French  ) is a 1,979-seat opera house, which was built from 1861 to 1875 for the Paris Opera.  It was called the Salle des Capucines, because of its location on the Boulevard des Capucines in the 9th arrondissement of Paris, but soon became known as the Palais Garnier, in recognition of its opulence and its architect, Charles Garnier.  The theatre is also often referred to as the Opéra Garnier (French  ) and historically was known as the Opéra de Paris or simply the Opéra,  as it was the primary home of the Paris Opera and its associated Paris Opera Ballet until 1989, when the Opéra Bastille opened at the Place de la Bastille. 

Hasely Crawford<====>67506<====>Hasely Crawford  Hasely Joachim Crawford TC (born 16 August 1950) is a former track and field athlete from Trinidad and Tobago.  In 1976, he became his country's first Olympic champion and the first Olympic 100m champion from a Caribbean country.  A stadium was renamed in his honor in 2001. Early yearsCrawford was born in San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago, one of the eleven children of Lionel Crawford and Phyllis Holder, and began pursuing athletics at the age of 17.  He is a six-time Trinidad and Tobago 100 metres champion, and won the 200 metre title in 1976. 

Archie Hahn<====>67510<====>Archie Hahn  Charles Archibald "Archie" Hahn (September 14, 1880 – January 21, 1955) was an American track athlete and one of the best sprinters in the early 20th century. Having won sprint events at the 1903 American and Canadian championships, Hahn—born in Dodgeville, Wisconsin, but running for the University of Michigan—was among the favorites at the 1904 Olympic Games in St.  Louis, which was poorly attended by European athletes. In the first event at those Games, the 60 m, Hahn benefited from his quick start and won, making him a favorite for the remaining events he was entered in, the 100 m and 200 m. 

Mammoth Cave National Park<====>67511<====>Mammoth Cave National Park   Mammoth Cave National Park is a U. S.  national park in central Kentucky, encompassing portions of Mammoth Cave, the longest cave system known in the world.  Since the 1972 unification of Mammoth Cave with the even-longer system under Flint Ridge to the north, the official name of the system has been the Mammoth-Flint Ridge Cave System.  The park was established as a national park on July 1, 1941.  It became a World Heritage Site on October 27, 1981, and an international Biosphere Reserve on September 26, 1990. The park's   are located primarily in Edmonson County, with small areas extending eastward into Hart County and Barren County. 

Systematic element name<====>67513<====>Systematic element name A systematic element name is the  temporary name assigned to a newly synthesized or not yet synthesized chemical element.  A systematic symbol is also derived from this name.  In chemistry, a transuranic element receives a permanent name and symbol only after its synthesis has been confirmed.  In some cases, such as Transfermium Wars, such controversies have been protracted and highly political.  In order to discuss such elements without ambiguity, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) uses a set of rules to assign a temporary systematic name and symbol to each such element. 

Moscovium<====>67514<====>Moscovium   Moscovium is a synthetic chemical element with symbol Mc and atomic number 115.  It was first synthesized in 2003 by a joint team of Russian and American scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia.  In December 2015, it was recognized as one of four new elements by the Joint Working Party of international scientific bodies IUPAC and IUPAP.  On 28 November 2016, it was officially named after the Moscow oblast, which the JINR is situated in.Moscovium is an extremely radioactive element: its most stable known isotope, moscovium-290, has a half-life of only 0. 

Fourth International<====>67516<====>Fourth InternationalThe Fourth International (FI) is the Communist international organisation consisting of followers of Leon Trotsky, or Trotskyists, with the declared goal of helping the working class bring about socialism and work toward international communism.  The Fourth International was established in France in 1938: Trotsky and his supporters, having been expelled from the Soviet Union, considered the Comintern or Third International to have become "lost to" Stalinism and incapable of leading the international working class to political power.  The Transitional Program.  Retrieved November 5, 2008.   Thus, Trotskyists founded their own, competing "Fourth International". 

Lionel Jospin<====>67519<====>Lionel Jospin Lionel Jospin ( ; born 12 July 1937) is a French politician, who served as Prime Minister of France from 1997 to 2002. Jospin was the Socialist Party candidate for President of France in the elections of 1995 and 2002.  He was narrowly defeated in the final runoff election by Jacques Chirac in 1995.  He ran for President again in 2002, and was eliminated in the first round due to finishing behind both Chirac and the far-right candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen, following which he immediately announced his retirement from politics. BiographyEarly lifeLionel Jospin was born to a Protestant family in Meudon (Hauts-de-Seine), a suburb of Paris. 

Red River Gorge<====>67521<====>Red River Gorge The Red River Gorge is a canyon system on the Red River in east-central Kentucky.  Geologically, it is part of the Pottsville Escarpment. Much of the Gorge is located inside the Daniel Boone National Forest and has been subsequently reserved as the Red River Gorge Geological Area, an area of around  .   It has been designated a National Natural Landmark and National Archaeological District, and it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.The Clifty Wilderness Area lies entirely within the geological area in the Red River Gorge. 

Indre-et-Loire<====>67522<====>Indre-et-Loire{{Infobox settlement }}Indre-et-Loire ( ) is a department in west-central France named after the Indre and the Loire rivers. HistoryIndre-et-Loire is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790.  It was created from the former province of Touraine. Tours, the departmental prefecture, was a centre of learning in the early Middle Ages, having been a key focus of Christian evangelisation since St Martin became its first bishop in c.  375.  From the mid-15th century, the royal court repaired to the Loire Valley, with Tours as its capital, and at the confluence/crossing-point of the Loire and Cher rivers it became a centre of silk manufacturing and other luxury goods, including the wine-trade, creating a prosperous bourgeoisie. 

Maine-et-Loire<====>67523<====>Maine-et-Loire {{Infobox settlement }}Maine-et-Loire ( ) is a department in west-central France, in the Pays de la Loire region. HistorySee also: Anjou and  Maine-et-Loire is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on March 4, 1790.  Originally it was called Mayenne-et-Loire, but its name was changed to Maine-et-Loire in 1791.  It was created from most of the former province of Anjou.  Its present name is drawn from the Maine and Loire Rivers, which meet within the department. GeographyMaine-et-Loire is part of the current region of Pays-de-la-Loire and is surrounded by the departments of Ille-et-Vilaine, Mayenne, Sarthe, Indre-et-Loire, Vienne, Deux-Sèvres, Vendée, and Loire-Atlantique. 

Cumberland Falls<====>67524<====>Cumberland Falls  Cumberland Falls, sometimes called the Little Niagara, the Niagara of the South, or the Great Falls, is a waterfall on the Cumberland River in southeastern Kentucky.  Spanning the river at the border of McCreary and Whitley counties, the waterfall is the central feature of Cumberland Falls State Resort Park. It is believed the current falls formed as the result of erosion from its original starting place at an escarpment far downstream.  The site of the falls was occupied in pre-modern times by a variety of indigenous peoples, and more recently has passed through the multiple private owners until eventually being donated, along with surrounding land to Kentucky in 1930. 

Music of Australia<====>67530<====>Music of Australia  The music of Australia has an extensive history made of music societies.  Indigenous Australian music is a part of the unique heritage of a 40,000–60,000 year history which produced the iconic didgeridoo.  Contemporary fusions of Indigenous and Western styles (exemplified in the works of No Fixed Address, Yothu Yindi, Christine Anu and Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu) mark distinctly Australian contributions to world music.  During its early western history, Australia was a collection of British colonies, and Australian folk music and bush ballads such as Waltzing Matilda were heavily influenced by Anglo-Celtic traditions, while classical forms were derived from those of Europe. 

Economy of Australia<====>67533<====>Economy of Australia    The economy of Australia is highly developed and one of the largest mixed market economies in the world, with a GDP of AUD$1. 69 trillion as of 2017.Australia is the second wealthiest nation in terms of wealth per adult, after Switzerland.Australia's total wealth was AUD$8. 9 trillion as of June 2016.   In 2016, Australia was the 14th largest national economy by nominal GDP,    20th largest by PPP-adjusted GDP,    and was the 25th-largest goods exporter and 20th-largest goods importer. 

Paralympic Games<====>67537<====>Paralympic Games    The Paralympic Games is a major international multi-sport event involving athletes with a range of disabilities, including impaired muscle power (e. g.  paraplegia and quadriplegia, muscular dystrophy, post-polio syndrome, spina bifida), impaired passive range of movement, limb deficiency (e. g.  amputation or dysmelia), leg length difference, short stature, hypertonia, ataxia, athetosis, vision impairment and  intellectual impairment.  There are Winter and Summer Paralympic Games, which since the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea, are held almost immediately following the respective Olympic Games.  All Paralympic Games are governed by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). 

Australian Defence Force<====>67538<====>Australian Defence Force    The Australian Defence Force (ADF) is the military organisation responsible for the defence of Australia.  It consists of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), Australian Army, Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and a number of 'tri-service' units.  The ADF has a strength of just under 80,000 full-time personnel and active reservists, and is supported by the Department of Defence and several other civilian agencies. During the first decades of the 20th century, the Australian Government established the armed services as separate organisations.  Each service had an independent chain of command.  In 1976, the government made a strategic change and established the ADF to place the services under a single headquarters. 

Foreign relations of Australia<====>67539<====>Foreign relations of Australia  Foreign relations of Australia are influenced by its position as a leading trading nation and as a significant donor of humanitarian aid.  Australia's foreign policy is guided by a commitment to multilateralism and regionalism, as well as to strong bilateral relations with its allies.  Key concerns include free trade, terrorism, refugees, economic co-operation with Asia and stability in the Asia-Pacific.  Australia is active in the United Nations and the Commonwealth of Nations.  Given its history of starting and supporting important regional and global initiatives, it has been described as a regional middle power par excellence.

It has a total area of 83,879 km² (32,385 mi²), about twice the size of Switzerland.The landlocked country shares national borders with Switzerland (a non-European Union member state, which it borders for 158 km, or 98 mi) and the principality of Liechtenstein (also a non-EU member state, of which it borders for 34 km or 21 mi) to the west, Germany (801 km or 497 mi) and the Czech Republic (402 km or 249 mi) and Slovakia (105 km or 65 mi) to the north, Hungary to the east (331 km or 205 mi), and Slovenia (299 km or 185 mi) and Italy (404 km or 251 mi) to the south (total: 2,534 km or 1,574 mi).The westernmost third of the somewhat pear-shaped country consists of a narrow corridor between Germany and Italy that is between 32 km (19 mi) and 60 km (37 mi) wide. The rest of Austria lies to the east and has a maximum north–south width of 280 km (173 mi). The country measures almost 600 km (372 mi) in length, extending from Lake Constance (German Bodensee) on the Austrian-Swiss-German border in the west to the Neusiedler See on the Austrian-Hungarian border in the east. The contrast between these two lakes – one in the Alps and the other a typical steppe lake on the westernmost fringe of the Hungarian Plain – illustrates the diversity of Austria's landscape.Seven of Austria's nine provinces have long historical traditions predating the establishment of the Republic of Austria in 1918: Upper Austria, Lower Austria, Styria, Carinthia, Salzburg, Tyrol, and Vorarlberg. The provinces of Burgenland and Vienna were established after World War I. Most of Burgenland had been part of the Kingdom of Hungary, but it had a predominantly German-speaking population and hence became Austrian. Administrative and ideological reasons played a role in the establishment of Vienna as an independent province. Vienna, historically the capital of Lower Austria, was a socialist stronghold, whereas Lower Austria was conservative, and both socialists and conservatives wanted to consolidate their influence in their respective provinces. Each province has a provincial capital with the exception of Vienna, which is a province in its own right in addition to being the federal capital. In Vienna, the City Council and the mayor function as a provincial parliament and provincial governor, respectively. Physical geographyLandform regionsGeographic coordinates:  Austria may be divided into three unequal geographical areas. The largest part of Austria (62%) is occupied by the relatively young mountains of the Alps, but in the east, these give way to a part of the Pannonian plain, and north of the Danube River lies the Bohemian Forest, an older, but lower, granite mountain range.River DanubeThe Danube has its source near Donaueschingen in southwestern Germany and flows through Austria before emptying into the Black Sea. It is the only major European river that flows eastwards, and its importance as an inland waterway has been enhanced by the completion in 1992 of the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal in Bavaria, which connects the Rhine and Main rivers with the Danube and makes barge traffic from the North Sea to the Black Sea possible.The major rivers north of the watershed of the Austrian Alps (the Inn in Tyrol, the Salzach in Salzburg, and the Enns in Styria and Upper Austria) are direct tributaries of the Danube and flow north into the Danube valley, whereas the rivers south of the watershed in central and eastern Austria (the Gail and Drau rivers in Carinthia and the Mürz and Mur rivers in Styria) flow south into the drainage system of the Drau, which eventually empties into the Danube in Serbia. Consequently, central and eastern Austria are geographically oriented away from the watershed of the Alps: the provinces of Upper Austria and Lower Austria toward the Danube and the provinces of Carinthia and Styria toward the Drau.The AlpsThree major ranges of the Alps – the Northern Calcareous Alps, Central Alps, and Southern Calcareous Alps – run west to east through Austria. The Central Alps, which consist largely of a granite base, are the largest and highest ranges in Austria. The Central Alps run from Tyrol to approximately the Styria-Lower Austria border and include areas that are permanently glaciated in the Ötztal Alps on the Tyrolean–Italian border and the High Tauern in East Tyrol and Carinthia. The Northern Calcareous Alps, which run from Vorarlberg through Tyrol into Salzburg along the German border and through Upper Austria and Lower Austria toward Vienna, and the Southern Calcareous Alps, on the Carinthia-Slovenia border, are predominantly limestone and dolomite. At 3,797 m, Großglockner is the highest mountain in Austria. As a general rule, the farther east the Northern and Central Alps run, the lower they become. The altitude of the mountains also drops north and south of the central ranges.As a geographic feature, the Alps literally overshadow other landform regions. Just over 28% of Austria is moderately hilly or flat: the Northern Alpine Foreland, which includes the Danube Valley; the lowlands and hilly regions in northeastern and eastern Austria, which include the Danube Basin; and the rolling hills and lowlands of the Southeastern Alpine Foreland. The parts of Austria that are most suitable for settlement – that is, arable and climatically favorable – run north of the Alps through the provinces of Upper Austria and Lower Austria in the Danube Valley and then curve east and south of the Alps through Lower Austria, Vienna, Burgenland, and Styria. Austria's least mountainous landscape is southeast of the low Leithagebirge, which forms the southern lip of the Viennese Basin, where the steppe of the Hungarian Plain begins.Bohemian Forest (mountain range)The granite massif of the Bohemian Forest (known in German as the Böhmerwald), a low mountain range with bare and windswept plateaus and a harsh climate, is located north of the Danube Valley and covers the remaining 10% of Austria's area. Notable is the Manhartsberg a granite ridge which separates Waldviertel from Weinviertel.MountainsThe 35 highest mountains in Austria:!

Approximately one-tenth of Austria is barren or unproductive, that is, extremely Alpine or above the tree line. Just over 40% of Austria is covered by forests, the majority of which is in Alpine regions. Less than one-fifth of Austria is arable and suitable for conventional agriculture. The percentage of arable land in Austria increases in the East as the country becomes less alpine. More than one-fifth of Austria is pasture and meadow located at varying altitudes. Almost half of this grassland consists of high Alpine pastures.Historically, high Alpine pastures have been used during the summer for grazing dairy cattle, thus making space available at lower altitudes for cultivating and harvesting fodder for winter. Many of the high pastures are at altitudes of more than 1,000 m.Although agriculture in mountainous areas was at one time economically viable, in recent decades it has survived only with the help of extensive subsidies. A concern of farmers in these mountainous regions is that membership of the European Union might entail a curtailment of these subsidies and the end of Alpine agriculture. If this occurs, many areas will be reclaimed by nature after centuries of cultivation.Although the Alps are beautiful, they make many areas of Austria uninhabitable. Austria's so-called areas of permanent settlement – regions that are cultivated, continuously inhabited, and used for transportation, but do not include forests, Alpine pastures, or barren land – cover only 40% or 35,000 km² of the country. The great majority of the area of permanent settlement is in the Danube valley and the lowlands or hilly regions north, east, and south of the Alps, where approximately two-thirds of the population lives.In the country's predominantly Alpine provinces, most of the population live in river valleys: Bregenz on the shores of Lake Constance in Vorarlberg; Innsbruck on the Inn River in Tyrol; Salzburg on the Salzach River in Salzburg; and Klagenfurt on the Wörthersee lake in Carinthia. The higher the Alps are, the less inhabitable they become in terms of soil, microclimate, and vegetation. Conversely, the lower and broader the Alpine valleys are, the more densely populated they become.Tyrol illustrates most clearly the relationship between Alpine geography and habitation. As the most mountainous province (less than 3% of the land is arable), it is the most sparsely inhabited, with an area of permanent settlement of only 15%.Because of the Alps, the country as a whole is one of the least densely populated states of Western and Central Europe. With ninety-three inhabitants per square kilometre, Austria has a population density similar to that of the former Yugoslavia.Austria's national borders and geography have corresponded very little. Since the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Alps and the Danube have not served to mark political boundaries. Even within Austria, provincial borders were only occasionally set by the ranges and ridges of the Alps.Although the Alps did not mark political boundaries, they often separated groups of people from one another. Because in the past the Alps were impassable, inhabitants isolated in valleys or networks of valleys developed distinct regional subcultures. Consequently, the inhabitants of one valley frequently maintained dialects, native or traditional dress, architectural styles, and folklore that substantially differed from those of the next valley. Differences were great enough that the origins of outsiders could easily be identified. However, mass media, mobility, prosperity, and tourism have eroded the distinctness of Alpine regional subcultures to a great extent by reducing the isolation that gave them their particular character.Despite the Alps, Austria has historically been a land of transit. The Danube valley, for centuries Central Europe's aquatic link to the Balkan Peninsula and the "Orient" in the broadest sense of the word, has always been an avenue of east–west transit. However, Europe's division into two opposing economic and military blocs after World War II diminished Austria's importance as a place of transit. Since the opening of Eastern Europe in 1989, the country has begun to re-assume its historical role. By the early 1990s, it had already experienced a substantial increase in the number of people and vehicles crossing its eastern frontiers.Within the Alps, four passes and the roads that run through them are of particular importance for north–south transit. The Semmering Pass on the provincial border of Lower Austria and Styria connects the Viennese Basin with the Mürz and Mur valleys, thus providing northeast-southwest access to Styria and Slovenia, and, via Carinthia, to Italy.The Pyrhn Pass between the provinces of Upper Austria and Styria and the Tauern Pass between the High Tauern range and the Lower Tauern range of the Central Alps in Salzburg, provide access to the Mur Valley in Styria and the Drau Valley in Carinthia, respectively. The highways that run through these passes are important northwest-southeast lines of communication through the Alps. The Pyrhn highway has been nicknamed the Fremdarbeiterweg ("foreign workers' route") because millions of Gastarbeiter ("guest workers") in Germany use it to return to their homes in the Balkans and Turkey for vacation. Many Germans and northern Europeans also use it in the summer months to reach the Adriatic coast. After the outbreak of hostilities in Yugoslavia in the summer of 1991, however, a substantial amount of this traffic was re-routed through the Danube Valley and Hungary.The most important pass in the Austrian Alps is the Brenner Pass, located on the Austrian-Italian border in Tyrol. At 1,370 m, it is one of the lowest Alpine passes. The route up the Inn valley and over the Brenner Pass has been historically an important and convenient route of north–south transit between Germany and Italy, and provides the most direct route between Europe's two most highly industrialized regions: Germany and northern Italy.Natural resources:oil, lignite, timber, iron ore, copper, zinc, antimony, magnesite, tungsten, graphite, salt, hydropowerLand use: arable land:16.44% permanent crops:0.79% other:82.77% (2012)Irrigated land:1,170 km² (2007)Total renewable water resources:77.7 km 3  (2011)Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural) total:3.66 km 3 /yr (18%/79%/3%) per capital:452.4 m 3 /yr (2008)ClimateThe Alps serve as a watershed for Europe's three major kinds of weather systems that influence Austrian weather. The Atlantic maritime climate from the northwest is characterized by low-pressure fronts, mild air from the Gulf Stream, and precipitation. It has the greatest influence on the northern slopes of the Alps, the Northern Alpine Foreland, and the Danube valley. The continental climate is characterized by low pressure fronts with precipitation in summer and high pressure systems with cold and dry air in winter. It affects mainly eastern Austria. Mediterranean high-pressure systems from the south are characterized by few clouds and warm air, and they influence the weather of the southern slopes of the Alps and that of the Southeastern Alpine Foreland, making them the most temperate part of Austria.One peculiarity of the Mediterranean weather systems is the föhn wind, a warm air mass that originates in the African Sahara and moves north rapidly, periodically raising temperatures up to   in a short period of time. Many people respond to this rapid weather change with headaches, irritability, and circulatory problems. During the winter, the rapid warming that accompanies a föhn can thaw the snow cover in the Alps to such an extent that avalanches occur.Given the importance of Alpine skiing for the Austrian tourist industry, December is the month during which the weather is watched with the greatest anticipation. As a rule, Atlantic maritime weather systems bring snow, and continental weather systems help keep it. However, a predominance of cold, dry continental systems or warm Mediterranean ones inevitably postpone the beginning of the ski season. In the summer, Mediterranean high-pressure systems bring warm, sunny weather.Ecological concernsAustrians faced a number of ecological problems in the 1990s. One of the most pressing is the pollution caused by the staggering increase of traffic through the country. Traffic on the superhighway going through the Brenner Pass has, for example, increased from 600,000 vehicles per year in the early 1970s to over 10 million per year in the early 1990s. One quarter of the traffic crossing Austria consists of semitrailers used for heavy transport. The opening of Eastern Europe has only exacerbated the problem of transit traffic.The Alpine valleys through which much of this traffic passes are unusually vulnerable to ecological damage. Narrow valleys are not conducive to dissipation of noise or pollutants caused by motor vehicles. Inversions – cold layers of air that trap warm layers of air or warm layers of air that trap cold layers in the valleys and lowlands – also seasonally contribute to the magnitude of the pollution problem.Austria has negotiated with the EU to set limits on the amount of commercial transit traffic, especially through Tyrol. Work is also under way to develop a "piggy-back" system of loading semitrailers on to flatbed railroad cars in southern Germany and northern Italy, transporting them through Tyrol by rail. Environmentalists have pushed for measures that are more far-reaching. They advocate, for example, digging a tunnel from Garmisch-Partenkirchen in southern Germany to Bolzano in northern Italy.Pollution is also brought by the weather systems that determine the country's climate. Atlantic maritime weather systems carry pollution into Austria from northwestern Europe. Austria's proximity to industrialized regions of former Communist states, with negligible or no pollution control policies or equipment, combined with the influence of continental weather systems also have proved to be extremely harmful. Mediterranean weather systems transmit industrial pollutants from northern Italy.As a result of domestic and foreign pollution, 37% of Austria's forests had been damaged by acid rain and/or pollutant emissions by 1991. The damage to forests has had dire consequences, including the decimation of forests that for centuries had protected many Alpine communities from avalanches, erosion, mudslides, or flooding caused by runoff.The seriousness of the ecological problems confronting the country gave rise in the 1970s to an environmentalist movement. Political parties were formed, and representatives were elected to parliament. A referendum in 1978 closed down a newly completed nuclear power station and turned the country away from the exploitation of nuclear energy. Public opposition in 1984 stopped the planned construction of a hydroelectric power station in a wetlands region.The country's long-standing commercial use of the Alps for recreational purposes has also come under examination. Extensive tourism places an inordinate amount of pressure on sensitive Alpine ecosystems. Ski runs damage forests, as do summer sports such as off-trail mountain hiking or mountain biking. Many Alpine villages have also grown greatly because of the tourist industry. In extreme cases, they have up to twenty hotel beds for each inhabitant, a ratio that places a disproportionate seasonal burden on communal infrastructures and the environment. For these reasons, efforts have been made to introduce "green" or "soft" forms of tourism that are more compatible with the Alpine environment.Part of the solution to Austria's ecological problems is being sought in stricter environmental legislation at the domestic level. Ultimately, however, pan-European and global cooperation in the realm of pollution and emission control will be necessary to protect the country's environment.

Economy of Austria<====>67545<====>Economy of Austria   Austria is one of the 14 richest countries in the world in terms of GDP (Gross domestic product) per capita,    has a well-developed social market economy, and a high standard of living.  Until the 1980s, many of Austria's largest industry firms were nationalised; in recent years, however, privatisation has reduced state holdings to a level comparable to other European economies.  Labour movements are particularly strong in Austria and have large influence on labour politics.  Next to a highly developed industry, international tourism is the most important part of the national economy. 

Austrian Armed Forces<====>67549<====>Austrian Armed Forces   The Austrian Armed Forces ( , lit. : Austrian Federal Army) is the military of the Republic of Austria.  It is divided into branches: the Joint Forces (Streitkräfteführungskommando; SKFüKdo), which consist of Land Forces (Landstreitkräfte), Air Forces (Luftstreitkräfte), International Missions (Internationale Einsätze) and Special Forces (Spezialeinsatzkräfte), next to Mission Support (Kommando Einsatzunterstützung; KdoEU) and Joint Command Support Centre (Führungsunterstützungszentrum; FüUZ).    Austria, a landlocked country, today has no navy; from 1958 to 2006 however the Austrian army operated a naval squadron of patrol boats on the River Danube.  That duty has been assumed by the Bundespolizei (Federal Police). 

Geography of the Bahamas<====>67551<====>Geography of the BahamasThe Bahamas is a group of about 700 atolls and cays in the western Atlantic Ocean, of which only between 30 and 40 are inhabited.  The largest of the islands is Andros Island, located   southeast of Florida.  The Bimini islands are to its northwest.  To the North is the island of Grand Bahama, home to the second-largest city in the country, Freeport.  The island of Great Abaco is to its east.  In the far south is the island of Great Inagua, the second-largest island in the country.  Other notable islands include Eleuthera, Cat Island, San Salvador Island, Acklins, Crooked Island, and Mayaguana. 

Invasive species<====>67554<====>Invasive speciesAn invasive species is a plant, fungus, or animal species that is not native to a specific location (an introduced species), and that has a tendency to spread to a degree believed to cause damage to the environment, human economy or human health.   A study by Colautti et al.  pointed out widely divergent perceptions of the criteria for invasive species among researchers (p.  135) and concerns with the subjectivity of the term "invasive" (p.  136).    Some of the alternate usages of the term are below:The term as most often used applies to introduced species (also called "non-indigenous" or "non-native") that adversely affect the habitats and bioregions they invade economically, environmentally, or ecologically. 

Mickey Slim<====>67556<====>Mickey Slim The Mickey Slim was a drink that had short-lived popularity in the United States in the 1940s and 1950s.According to The Dedalus Book of Absinthe by Phil Baker,   it was made by combining gin with a pinch of DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), an insecticide that would later be banned in most countries; consumers of this concoction claimed that its effects were similar to absinthe. Due to lack of documentary evidence, it has been questioned whether this is a modern urban legend.  Time Magazine, August 1, 1971 reported that Pest Control Executive Robert Loibl and his wife Louise start breakfast with a 10 mg capsule of DDT to demonstrate its safety, doing so for three months in front of witnesses.

Ophioglossales<====>67581<====>Ophioglossales Ophioglossales (lit.  'snake-tongue [plants]') are a small group of pteridophyte plants.   Traditionally they are included in the division Pteridophyta, the ferns, originally as a family and later as the order Ophioglossales.   In some classifications this group is placed in a separate division, the Ophioglossophyta, but recent molecular systematic studies have shown the Ophioglossales to be closely related to the Psilotales. In the molecular phylogenetic classification of Smith et al.  in 2006, Ophioglossales, in its present circumscription, was placed with the order Psilotales in the class Psilotopsida.The linear sequence of Christenhusz et al.

Surrealist techniques<====>67594<====>Surrealist techniques    Surrealism in art, poetry, and literature uses numerous techniques and games to provide inspiration.  Many of these are said to free imagination by producing a creative process free of conscious control.  The importance of the unconscious as a source of inspiration is central to the nature of surrealism. The Surrealist movement has been a fractious one since its inception.   The value and role of the various techniques  has been one of many subjects of disagreement.  Some Surrealists consider automatism and games to be sources of inspiration only, while others consider them starting points for finished works. 

Transport in Anguilla<====>67596<====>Transport in AnguillaOne of the British overseas territories, the Caribbean island of Anguilla measures only   long by   wide, so transport is simpler than in many countries.   There is no public transport, such as bus or rail systems, since there isn't enough need.   However, Anguilla's roads are better maintained than on many Caribbean islands.  Cars are the main means of transport, with driving on the left-hand side of the road, as in the United Kingdom.   Although speed limits rarely exceed   per hour and traffic moves slowly, with the island's small size it doesn't take long to get anywhere. 

Shade tree<====>67610<====>Shade tree A shade tree is any tree grown specifically for its shade.  This term usually applies to large trees with spreading canopies.   Some of the most popular shade trees in temperate countries are oaks, maples, ashes, lindens, and elms. In tropical countries, trees such as the African tulip tree, Hopea odorata, and some Erythrina species are often planted as shade trees.  PlantingThere are a few factors to consider when choosing a shade tree: deciduousness, coverage, longevity, and the ability of the roots to damage foundations. Shade trees can enhance the privacy of a garden, patio, or back yard, by obstructing the view of outsiders.

It is the second-heaviest known element and the penultimate element of the 7th period of the periodic table. The discovery of tennessine was officially announced in Dubna, Russia, by a Russian–American collaboration in April 2010, which makes it the most recently discovered element  .  One of its daughter isotopes was created directly in 2011, partially confirming the results of the experiment.  The experiment itself was repeated successfully by the same collaboration in 2012 and by a joint German–American team in May 2014. 

Transport in Antigua and Barbuda<====>67618<====>Transport in Antigua and Barbuda Antigua and Barbuda's transport systems include both public and privately run services.   Roads in the country are steep, winding, unpaved, and full of potholes.   Driving is on the left-hand side.   Volcanic ash which sometimes covers roads can make them slippery.   The speed limit is set at 40 mph, but it isn't well-enforced.   Because there are few traffic signs, driving in unfamiliar areas can be confusing. Public transportation vehicles contain the letters "BUS" for buses or "TX" for taxis on their yellow licence plates.   The government regulates taxi service, setting fixed fares rather than using a metered system. 

Elm<====>67619<====>ElmElms are deciduous and semi-deciduous trees comprising the flowering plant genus Ulmus in the plant family Ulmaceae.  The genus first appeared in the Miocene geological period about 20 million years ago, originating in what is now central Asia.  Richens, R.  H.  (1983).  Elm.  Cambridge University Press.   These trees flourished and spread over most of the Northern Hemisphere, inhabiting the temperate and tropical-montane regions of North America and Eurasia, presently ranging southward across the Equator into Indonesia. Elms are components of many kinds of natural forests.  Moreover, during the 19th and early 20th centuries many species and cultivars were also planted as ornamental street, garden, and park trees in Europe, North America, and parts of the Southern Hemisphere, notably Australasia.

Full metal jacket bullet<====>67815<====>Full metal jacket bullet A full metal jacket (FMJ) bullet is a small-arms projectile consisting of a soft core (often lead) encased in a shell of harder metal, such as gilding metal, cupronickel, or less commonly a steel alloy.  In military nomenclature, it is often labeled ball ammunition. The use of full metal jacketing in military ammunition came about because of the need for improved feeding characteristics in small arms using internal mechanical manipulation of the cartridge to chamber rounds as opposed to externally hand-reloading single-shot firearms.  The harder gilding was less prone to deformation than softer exposed lead, which improved feeding. 

Gilding metal<====>67832<====>Gilding metalGilding metal is a copper alloy, a brass, comprising 95% copper and 5% zinc.British Army Dress Regulations define gilding metal as “8 parts copper to 1 of zinc”.

The musical broke new ground in musical theatre by defining the genre of "rock musical", using a racially integrated cast, and inviting the audience onstage for a "Be-In" finale. 

Squaring the square<====>67903<====>Squaring the squareSquaring the square is the problem of tiling an integral square using only other integral squares.  (An integral square is a square whose sides have integer length. ) The name was coined in a humorous analogy with squaring the circle.  Squaring the square is an easy task unless additional conditions are set.   The most studied restriction is that the squaring be perfect, meaning that the sizes of the smaller squares are all different.  A related problem is squaring the plane, which can be done even with the restriction that each natural number occurs exactly once as a size of a square in the tiling.

His attraction to the latest innovations was expressed in almost completely Futurist forms in his drawings, while he developed a unique style in his painting that was a mixture of Art Nouveau, Fauvism, Expressionism and Orphism.  It was not until 1917, after meeting with Giacomo Balla in Rome, and with Filippo Tommaso Marinetti in Naples (who later enthusiastically praised Conti's book Imbottigliature which was about to be printed) that Conti became part of the Futurist movement. 

Busy beaver<====>67911<====>Busy beaver The busy beaver game consists of designing a halting, binary-alphabet Turing machine which writes the most 1s on the tape, using only a limited set of states.  The rules for the 2-state game are as follows:the machine must have two states in addition to the halting state, and the tape starts with 0s only. As the player, you should conceive each state aiming for the maximum output of 1s on the tape while making sure the machine will halt eventually. The nth busy beaver, BB-n or simply "busy beaver" is the Turing machine that wins the n-state Busy Beaver Game.

He was recognised as an outstanding pianist, though he chose not to capitalise on this skill and rarely performed in public. 

Copernicium<====>67958<====>Copernicium  Copernicium is a synthetic chemical element with symbol Cn and atomic number 112.  It is an extremely radioactive element, and can only be created in a laboratory.  The most stable known isotope, copernicium-285, has a half-life of approximately 29 seconds.  Copernicium was first created in 1996 by the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt, Germany.  It is named after the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus.  In the periodic table of the elements, copernicium is a d-block transactinide element.  During reactions with gold, it has been shown    to be an extremely volatile metal and a group 12 element, so much so that it is probably a gas at standard temperature and pressure.

Ginkgo biloba<====>67963<====>Ginkgo biloba  Ginkgo biloba, commonly known as ginkgo or gingko    (both pronounced  ), also known as the ginkgo tree or the maidenhair tree,  is the only living species in the division Ginkgophyta, all others being extinct.  It is found in fossils dating back 270 million years.  Native to China,  the tree is widely cultivated, and was cultivated early in human history.  It has various uses in traditional medicine and as a source of food.  The genus name Ginkgo is regarded as a misspelling of the Japanese gin kyo, "silver apricot". 

Ginkgoales<====>67965<====>Ginkgoales Ginkgoales or Ginkgophyte is a gymnosperm order containing only one extant species: Ginkgo biloba, the ginkgo tree.   It is monotypic, (the only taxon) within the class Ginkgoopsida, which itself is monotypic within the division Ginkgophyta.  The order includes five families,  of which only Ginkgoaceae remains extant.  HistoryThe first Ginkgo leaves were found from the Triassic period, but there were many species of Ginkgo during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods as well.  These periods, known collectively as the Mesozoic era, were when diversity and distribution for all plants were at their highest, including in Ginkophytes. 

Ginkgoaceae<====>67966<====>Ginkgoaceae The Ginkgoaceae is a family of gymnosperms which appeared during the Mesozoic Era, of which the only extant representative is Ginkgo biloba, which is for this reason sometimes regarded as a living fossil. Formerly, however, there were several other genera, and forests of ginkgo existed. Because leaves can take such diverse forms within a single species, these are a poor measure of diversity, although differing structures of wood point to the existence of diverse ginkgo forests in ancient times.

Lycopodiophyta<====>67970<====>Lycopodiophyta The Division Lycopodiophyta (sometimes called lycophyta or lycopods) is a tracheophyte subgroup of the Kingdom Plantae.  It is one of the oldest lineages of extant (living) vascular plants and contains extinct plants like Baragwanathia that have been dated from the Silurian (ca.  425 million years ago). These species reproduce by shedding spores and have macroscopic alternation of generations, although some are homosporous while others are heterosporous.   Most members of Lycopodiophyta bear a protostele, and the sporophyte generation is dominant.  Eichhorn, Evert, and Raven (2005).  Biology of Plants, Seventh Edition. 

Urolagnia<====>67972<====>Urolagnia    Urolagnia (also urophilia, undinism, golden shower and watersports) is a form of salirophilia (which is a form of paraphilia) in which sexual excitement is associated with the sight or thought of urine or urination.

Gaviiformes<====>68001<====>Gaviiformes Gaviiformes is an order of aquatic birds containing the loons or divers and their closest extinct relatives.  Modern gaviiformes are found in many parts of North America and northern Eurasia (Europe, Asia and debatably Africa), though prehistoric species were more widespread. Classification and evolutionThere are five living species, and all are placed in the genus Gavia.   The loons were formerly often considered to be the most ancient of the northern hemisphere bird families; this idea grew basically out of the perceived similarity of shape and (probably) habits between loons and the entirely unrelated extinct Cretaceous order Hesperornithiformes. 

Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics<====>68003<====>Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics  At the 1896 Summer Olympics, the first modern Olympiad, twelve athletics events were contested.  A total of 25 medals (12 silver for winners, 13 bronze for runner-up, none for third) were awarded.  The medals were later denoted as 37 modern medals (12 gold, 13 silver, 12 bronze).  All of the events except the marathon were held in the Panathinaiko Stadium, which was also the finish for the marathon.   Events were held on 6 April, 7 April, 9 April, and 10 April 1896 (all dates are according to the Gregorian calendar). 

Loon<====>68005<====>Loon   The loons (North America) or divers (UK/Ireland) are a group of aquatic birds found in many parts of North America and northern Eurasia.  All living species of loons are members of the genus Gavia, family Gaviidae and order Gaviiformes. Description The loon, the size of a large duck or small goose, resembles these birds in shape when swimming.  Like ducks and geese but unlike coots (which are Rallidae) and grebes (Podicipedidae), the loon's toes are connected by webbing.  The bird may be confused with cormorants (Phalacrocoracidae), which are not too distant relatives of divers and like them are heavy set birds whose bellies – unlike those of ducks and geese – are submerged when swimming.

2000 Guineas Stakes<====>68030<====>2000 Guineas Stakes |}    The 2000 Guineas Stakes is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to three-year-old thoroughbred colts and fillies.  It is run on the Rowley Mile at Newmarket over a distance of 1 mile (1,609 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in late April or early May. 

St Leger Stakes<====>68032<====>St Leger Stakes |} The St Leger Stakes (spelt without a full stop in UK English) is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to three-year-old thoroughbred colts and fillies. It is run at Doncaster over a distance of 1-mile, 6 furlongs and 115 yards  (2,921 metres) , and it is scheduled to take place each year in September.Established in 1776, the St Leger is the oldest of Britain's five Classics. It is the last of the five to be run each year, and its distance is longer than any of the other four.The St Leger is the final leg of the English Triple Crown, which begins with the 2000 Guineas and continues with the Derby. It also completes the Fillies' Triple Crown, following on from the 1000 Guineas and the Oaks. The St Leger has rarely featured Triple Crown contenders in recent decades, with the only one in recent years being the 2012 2,000 Guineas and Derby winner Camelot, who finished second in the St Leger.HistoryEarly yearsThe event was devised by Anthony St Leger, an army officer and politician who lived near Doncaster. It was initially referred to as "A Sweepstake of 25 Guineas", and its original distance was two miles. The rules stipulated that colts and geldings were to carry 8 st, and fillies would receive an allowance of 2 lb.The inaugural running was held at Cantley Common on 24 September 1776. The first winner was an unnamed filly owned by the event's organiser, the 2nd Marquess of Rockingham. The filly was later named Allabaculia.The title St Leger Stakes was decided at a dinner party held in 1776 at The Red Lion Inn located in the Market Place, Doncaster to discuss the following year's race. It was suggested that it should be called the Rockingham Stakes in honour of the host, the Marquess of Rockingham, but the Marquess proposed that it should be named instead after Anthony St Leger. The event was moved to its present location, Town Moor, in 1778. The race came to national prominence in 1800, when a horse called Champion registered the first Derby-St Leger double. Its length was cut to 1 mile, 6 furlongs and 193 yards in 1813, and despite some minor alterations has remained much the same ever since. The victory of West Australian in 1853 completed the first success in the Triple Crown.Post-1900The St Leger Stakes was closed to geldings in 1906. It was transferred to Newmarket during World War I, and the substitute event was called the September Stakes. It was cancelled in 1939 because of the outbreak of World War II, and the following year's edition was held at Thirsk in November. For the remainder of this period it was staged at Manchester (1941), Newmarket (1942–44) and York (1945).The race was switched to Ayr in 1989 after the scheduled running at Doncaster was abandoned due to subsidence. The 2006 race took place at York because its regular venue was closed for redevelopment.The St Leger Stakes has inspired a number of similar events around the world, although many are no longer restricted to three-year-olds. European variations include the Irish St. Leger, the Prix Royal-Oak, the Deutsches St. Leger and the St. Leger Italiano. Other national equivalents include the Kikuka-shō, the New Zealand St. Leger and the VRC St Leger.Records Leading jockey (9 wins):Bill Scott – Jack Spigot (1821), Memnon (1825), The Colonel (1828), Rowton (1829), Don John (1838), Charles the Twelfth (1839), Launcelot (1840), Satirist (1841), Sir Tatton Sykes (1846)Leading trainer (16 wins):John Scott – Matilda (1827), The Colonel (1828), Rowton (1829), Margrave (1832), Touchstone (1834), Don John (1838), Charles the Twelfth (1839), Launcelot (1840), Satirist (1841), The Baron (1845), Newminster (1851), West Australian (1853), Warlock (1856), Imperieuse (1857), Gamester (1859), The Marquis (1862)Leading owner (7 wins):Archibald Hamilton, 9th Duke of Hamilton – Paragon (1786), Spadille (1787), Young Flora (1788), Tartar (1792), Petronius (1808), Ashton (1809), William (1814)Fastest winning time (at Doncaster) – Masked Marvel (2011), 3m 00.44sWidest winning margin – Never Say Die (1954), 12 lengthsLongest odds winner – Theodore (1822), 200/1Shortest odds winner – Galtee More (1897), 1/10Most runners – 30, in 1825Fewest runners – 3, in 1917 WinnersYear Winner Jockey Trainer Owner Time 1776 Allabaculia John Singleton Christopher Scaife 2nd Marq. of Rockingham  1777 Bourbon John Cade  William Sotheron  1778 Hollandoise George Herring Joseph Rose Sir Thomas Gascoigne  1779 Tommy George Lowry Joseph Rose Thomas Stapleton  1780 Ruler John Mangle  William Bethell  1781 Serina Richard Foster J.

Circular definition<====>68038<====>Circular definition A circular definition is one that uses the term(s) being defined as a part of the definition or assumes a prior understanding of the term being defined.  There are several kinds of circular definition, and several ways of characterising the term: pragmatic, lexicographic and linguistic. Approaches to characterizing circular definitionsPragmaticFrom a pragmatic point of view, circular definitions may be characterised in terms of new, useful or helpful information: A definition is deficient if the audience must either already know the meaning of the key term, or if the term to be defined is used in the definition itself. 

Standard Industrial Classification<====>68040<====>Standard Industrial Classification  The Standard Industrial Classification SIC is a system for classifying industries by a four-digit code.  Established in the United States in 1937, it is used by government agencies to classify industry areas.  The SIC system is also used by agencies in other countries, e. g. , by the United Kingdom's Companies House.  In the United States the SIC code is being supplanted by the six-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS code), which was released in 1997; however certain government departments and agencies, such as the U. S.  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), still use the SIC codes. 

Chess960<====>68042<====>Chess960  Chess960, also called Fischer Random Chess (originally Fischerandom), is a variant of chess invented and advocated by former world chess champion Bobby Fischer, publicly announced on June 19, 1996, in Buenos Aires, Argentina.    It employs the same board and pieces as standard chess, but the starting position of the pieces on the players'   is randomized.  The random setup renders the prospect of obtaining an advantage through the memorization of opening lines impracticable, compelling players to rely on their talent and creativity. Randomizing the main pieces had long been known as Shuffle Chess; however, Chess960 introduces restrictions on the randomization, "preserving the dynamic nature of the game by retaining bishops of opposite colours for each player and the right to castle for both sides".

Patron saint<====>68055<====>Patron saintA patron saint,  patroness saint, patron hallow or heavenly protector is a saint who in Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism, Eastern Orthodoxy, or particular branches of Islam, is regarded as the heavenly advocate of a nation, place, craft, activity, class, clan, family or person. Catholics believe that patron saints, having already transcended to the metaphysical, are able to intercede effectively for the needs of their special charges.   Historically, a similar practice has also occurred in many Islamic lands.  Although Islam has no codified doctrine of patronage on the part of saints, it has nevertheless been an important part of both Sunni and Shia Islamic tradition that particularly important classical saints have served as the heavenly advocates for specific Muslim empires, nations, cities, towns, and villages. 

DIVX<====>68056<====>DIVX DIVX (Digital Video Express) was an unsuccessful attempt by Circuit City and the entertainment law firm Ziffren, Brittenham, Branca and Fischer to create an alternative to video rental in the United States. FormatDIVX was a rental format variation on the DVD player in which a customer would buy a DIVX disc (similar to a DVD) for approximately US$4. 50, which was watchable for up to 48 hours from its initial viewing.  After this period, the disc could be viewed by paying a continuation fee to play it for two more days.  Viewers who wanted to watch a disc an unlimited number of times could convert the disc to a "DIVX silver" disc for an additional fee.

Algebraic notation is more concise and requires less effort to avoid ambiguity, but much older literature uses descriptive notation.   Descriptive notation exists in many language-based variants, the most prevalent being English descriptive notation and Spanish descriptive notation.  Natural language was generally used to describe moves in early chess literature and is the ultimate source of all forms of descriptive notation.

The soundtrack was composed by Charles Strouse. Bonnie and Clyde is considered a landmark film, and is regarded as one of the first films of the New Hollywood era, since it broke many cinematic taboos and was popular with the younger generation. 

David A. Wheeler<====>68247<====>David A.  Wheeler  David A.  Wheeler (born 1965) is a computer scientist.He is best known for his work on open source software/free-libre software (FLOSS or OSS/FS) and computer security. Open Source SoftwareIn 2000, Wheeler self-published "Why Open Source Software / Free Software? Look at the Numbers!",  a text where he argued that considering FLOSS is justified.  According to Google Scholar, this article has been cited over 400 times in other scholarly works   and in the 2004 report of the California Performance Review.   Wheeler was interviewed about his webpage by Linux. 

Harrison Dillard<====>68251<====>Harrison Dillard   William Harrison "Bones" Dillard (born July 8, 1923) is an American former track and field athlete, the only male so far to win Olympic titles in both sprinting and hurdling events. Early careerDillard was born in Cleveland, Ohio, attended East Technical High School.  He entered Baldwin-Wallace College in 1941 and joined Pi Lambda Phi International Fraternity, and two years later was drafted into the Army serving in the all-black 92nd Infantry Division known as the Buffalo Soldiers.   He returned to college in 1946 and resumed athletics, to which he had been inspired by Jesse Owens, who was also from Cleveland and had attended East Technical High School as well. 

List of sovereign states<====>68253<====>List of sovereign states   This list of sovereign states provides an overview of sovereign states around the world, with information on their status and recognition of their sovereignty. Membership within the United Nations system divides the 206 listed states into three categories: 193 member states,    2 observer states, and 11 other states.  The sovereignty dispute column indicates states whose sovereignty is undisputed (191 states) and states whose sovereignty is disputed (15 states, out of which there are 5 member states, 1 observer state and 9 other states). Compiling a list such as this can be a difficult and controversial process, as there is no definition that is binding on all the members of the community of nations concerning the criteria for statehood. 

List of sovereign states and dependent territories by continent<====>68256<====>List of sovereign states and dependent territories by continent  This is a list of sovereign states and dependent territories of the world by continent, displayed with their respective national flags and capitals, including the following entities:In bold: Internationally recognized sovereign statesThe 193 member states of the United Nations (UN)Vatican City (administered by the Holy See, a UN-recognized non-member state)In bold italics: States with limited recognition and associated states not members of the United NationsDe facto sovereign states with partial international recognition, such as the State of Palestine and the Republic of KosovoDe facto sovereign states lacking general international recognitionCook Islands and Niue, two associated states of New Zealand without UN membershipIn italics: Non-sovereign territories that are recognized by the UN as part of some member stateDependent territoriesSpecial territories recognized by international treaty (such as the special administrative regions of China)Other territories often regarded as separate geographical territories even though they are integral parts of their mother countries (such as the overseas departments of France)Following the United Nations geoscheme,  this list divides the world using the seven-continent model, with islands grouped into adjacent continents.

Considering this, the following changes from the previous list occur:Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Georgia, and Turkey are members of the Council of Europe. In particular, Cyprus is an EU member, while Turkey is a candidate.Russia is a member of both the Council of Europe and the Asia Cooperation Dialogue.However, in general only internationally recognized sovereign states are members of intergovernmental organizations, and not every one of them is a member of one of the organizations listed above.Dependent territoriesDependent territories, through political ties with their mother countries, may be associated with another continent other than its own geographical continent. For example, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, and Réunion, all overseas departments of France, are part of the EU and use the euro as their official currency. Other dependent territories of EU members, such as Greenland, while not part of the EU, enjoy special relationships with the EU.The following dependent territories, all of them sparsely populated islands remote from continental mass, may be grouped into more than one continent, as there is no general convention as to which continent they belong to:The British Indian Ocean Territory is geographically located in the Indian Ocean, about equidistant from Africa and Asia. Politically it is administered from the United Kingdom, while historically it is part of Mauritius. It may be grouped into either Africa or Asia.Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands are geographically located in the Indian Ocean, much closer to Asia than to Australia. Politically they are administered from Australia. They may be grouped into Asia or Oceania.Clipperton Island is geographically located in the Pacific Ocean, much closer to North America than to other Pacific Islands. Politically they are administered from France, previously from French Polynesia. They may be grouped into North America or Oceania.The French Southern Territories, which exclude the Antarctic territorial claim of Adélie Land, are geographically located in the Indian Ocean; the Îles Éparses are close to Madagascar, while other islands are approximately equidistant from Africa, Antarctica and Australia. Politically they are administered from Réunion. They may be grouped into Africa or Antarctica.South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands is geographically in the Atlantic Ocean, about equidistant from South America and Antarctica. Politically it is administered from the Falkland Islands. It may be grouped into South America or Antarctica.See alsoList of sovereign states and dependent territories by continent (data file) — this data in a plain text format suitable for automated processingList of countries and capitals in native languagesList of national capitalsGallery of sovereign state flagsGallery of dependent territory flagsReferences External linksUN List of TerritoriesCIA – The World FactbookU.S. Department of State: Background notesEuropean Commission: List of countries, territories and currenciesAdministrative Divisions of Countries ("Statoids")  DEFAULTSORT

Gold halide<====>68258<====>Gold halideGold halides are compounds of gold with the halogens. MonohalidesAuCl, AuBr, and AuI are all crystalline solids with a structure containing alternating linear chains: . . -X-Au-X-Au-X-Au-X-. . .  The X-Au-X angle is less than 180°.  The monomeric AuF molecule has been detected in the gas phase.  TrihalidesGold triiodide does not exist or is unstable.   AuCl 3  readily forms out of the elements at temperatures below 254 °C.  It is a volatile red solid.  The volatile species is the dimer Au 2 Cl 6 .  .  Likewise, AuBr 3  can be formed from the elements and exists primarily as the dimer Au 2 Br 6 . 

Communications in Argentina<====>68259<====>Communications in Argentina Communications in Argentina gives an overview of the postal, telephone, Internet, radio, television, and newspaper services available in Argentina. PostalThe national postal service, Correo Argentino, was established in 1854, privatized in 1997, and partly re-nationalized in 2003.  There are no standard abbreviations for provinces' names; but the province name is optional and usually not needed if the postal code is correct.  The format of the postal code was expanded in 1998 to include more specific information on location within cities; it now uses a letter that identifies the province, a four-digit number, and then three more letters (and slightly different numbers are used for different parts of a city, which was formerly done only in the case of Buenos Aires). 

Stock market downturn of 2002<====>68260<====>Stock market downturn of 2002 In 2001, stock prices took a sharp downturn (some say "stock market crash" or "the Internet bubble bursting") in stock markets across the United States, Canada, Asia, and Europe.  After recovering from lows reached following the September 11 attacks, indices slid steadily starting in March 2002, with dramatic declines in July and September leading to lows last reached in 1997 and 1998.  The U. S.  dollar declined steadily against the euro, reaching a 1-to-1 valuation not seen since the euro's introduction. ContextThis downturn can be viewed as part of a larger bear market or correction that began in 2000, according to a report by the Cleveland Federal Reserve. 

Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures<====>68264<====>Sexuality and gender identity-based culturesSexuality and gender identity-based cultures are subcultures and communities composed of people who have shared experiences, backgrounds, or interests due to common sexual or gender identities.  Among the first to argue that members of sexual minorities can also constitute cultural minorities were Adolf Brand, Magnus Hirschfeld, and Leontine Sagan in Germany.  These pioneers were later followed by the Mattachine Society and the Daughters of Bilitis in the United States. Not all persons of various gender and sexual orientations identify or affiliate with a particular subculture.  Reasons include geographic distance, unawareness of the subculture's existence, fear of social stigma, or personal preference to remain unidentified with sexuality- or gender-based subcultures or communities. 

Fag hag<====>68265<====>Fag hag Fag hag is a gay slang phrase referring to a woman who either associates mostly or exclusively with gay and bisexual men.  The phrase originated in gay male culture in the United States and was historically an insult.    Some women who associate with gay men object to being called fag hags while others embrace the term.   The male counterpart, for men who have similar interpersonal relationships with gay and bisexual men is fag stag. UsageFag hags are frequently stereotyped as outgoing women who are seeking a substitute for heterosexual relationships, or who are secretly (or openly) sexually attracted to gay men. 

Frombork<====>68271<====>Frombork Frombork ( ;  ) is a town in northern Poland, on the Vistula Lagoon, in Braniewo County, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship.  It had a population of 2,528  . The town was first mentioned in the 13th century.  In the early 16th century it was the residence of the   astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, who used it as a site for several of his observations. The town and its 700-year-old cathedral were badly damaged in World War II.  After the war the cathedral was meticulously reconstructed and is again a popular tourist destination. Frombork is known as “The Jewel of Warmia” because of its many historical sites. 

Trill (music)<====>68272<====>Trill (music)The trill (or shake, as it was known from the 16th until the 19th century) is a musical ornament consisting of a rapid alternation between two adjacent notes, usually a semitone or tone apart, which can be identified with the context of the trill.  Taylor, Eric.  "The AB Guide to Music Theory: Part I" pg.  92  (compare mordent and tremolo).  It is sometimes referred to by the German Triller, the Italian trillo, the French trille or the Spanish trino.  A cadential trill is a trill associated with a cadence. A trill provides rhythmic interest, melodic interest, and—through dissonance—harmonic interest. 

Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam<====>68273<====>Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South VietnamThe Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam, or PRG, was formed on June 8, 1969, as an underground government opposed to the government of the Republic of Vietnam under President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu.  Delegates of the National Liberation Front (the Viet Cong), as well as several smaller groups, participated in its creation. The PRG was recognized as the government of South Vietnam by most communist states.  It signed the 1973 Paris Peace Treaty as a separate party.  It became the provisional government of South Vietnam following the military defeat of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam on April 30, 1975. 

Hero of Alexandria<====>68274<====>Hero of Alexandria Hero of Alexandria ( ;  , Heron ho Alexandreus; also known as Heron of Alexandria  ; c.  10 AD – c.  70 AD) was a mathematician and engineer who was active in his native city of Alexandria, Roman Egypt.  He is considered the greatest experimenter of antiquity    and his work is representative of the Hellenistic scientific tradition.  Hero published a well recognized description of a steam-powered device called an aeolipile (sometimes called a "Hero engine").  Among his most famous inventions was a windwheel, constituting the earliest instance of wind harnessing on land. 

Microtonal music<====>68276<====>Microtonal music  Microtonal music or microtonality is the use in music of microtones—intervals smaller than a semitone, which are also called "microintervals".  It may also be extended to include any music using intervals not found in the customary Western tuning of twelve equal intervals per octave. TerminologyMicrotoneMicrotonal music can refer to any music containing microtones, therefore it is important to comprehend what a "microtone" is.  The words "microtone" and "microtonal" were coined before 1912 by Maud MacCarthy Mann in order to avoid the misnomer "quarter tone" when speaking of the srutis of Indian music  .  Prior to this time the term "quarter tone" was used, confusingly, not only for an interval actually half the size of a semitone, but also for all intervals (considerably) smaller than a semitone ( ;  ). 

Venera<====>68281<====>Venera  The Venera ( ,  ) series space probes were developed by the Soviet Union between 1961 and 1984 to gather data from Venus, Venera being the Russian name for Venus.  As with some of the Soviet Union's other planetary probes, the later versions were launched in pairs with a second vehicle being launched soon after the first of the pair. Ten probes from the Venera series successfully landed on Venus and transmitted data from the surface of Venus, including the two Vega program and Venera-Halley probes.  In addition, thirteen Venera probes successfully transmitted data from the atmosphere of Venus. 

Peasant<====>68282<====>Peasant A peasant is a pre-industrial agricultural laborer or farmer, especially one living in the Middle Ages under feudalism and paying rent, tax, fees or services to a landlord.In Europe, peasants were divided into three classes according to their personal status: slave, serf, and free tenant.  Peasants either hold title to land in fee simple, or hold land by any of several forms of land tenure, among them socage, quit-rent, leasehold, and copyhold.    The word "peasant" is—and long has been—often used pejoratively to refer to poor or landless farmers and agricultural workers, especially in the poorer countries of the world in which the agricultural labor force makes up a large percentage of the population.

Dominance (genetics)<====>68300<====>Dominance (genetics) Dominance in genetics is a relationship between alleles of one gene, in which the effect on phenotype of one allele masks the contribution of a second allele at the same locus.    The first allele is dominant and the second allele is recessive.   For genes on an autosome (any chromosome other than a sex chromosome), the alleles and their associated traits are autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive.  Dominance is a key concept in Mendelian inheritance and classical genetics.  Often the dominant allele codes for a functional protein whereas the recessive allele does not. 

Hijab<====>68301<====>Hijab A hijab ( ,  ,   or  ;   ,   or   (dialectal)) is a veil worn by some Muslim women in the presence of adult males outside of their immediate family, which usually covers the head and chest.  The word ḥijāb in the Quran refers not to women's clothing, but rather a spatial partition or curtain.   The term can refer to any head, face, or body covering worn by Muslim women that conforms to a certain standard of modesty.  Hijab can also be used to refer to the seclusion of women from men in the public sphere, or it may denote a metaphysical dimension, for example referring to "the veil which separates man or the world from God".

Eurovision Song Contest 1956<====>68311<====>Eurovision Song Contest 1956    The Eurovision Song Contest 1956 was the first edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest, held at the Teatro Kursaal in Lugano, Switzerland on Thursday 24 May. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union, the pan-European music competition was inspired by the Italian Sanremo Music Festival.   Lohengrin Filipello hosted the first contest which lasted approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes.   Seven countries participated, with each of them performing two songs.  Two jury members from all participating countries cast their votes in secret, based on which song was their favourite. 

Temple name<====>68314<====>Temple name  Temple names are commonly used when naming most Chinese, Korean (Goryeo and Joseon periods), and Vietnamese (such dynasties as Trần, Lý, and Lê) royalty.  They should not be confused with era names.  Compared to posthumous names, the use of temple names is more exclusive.   Both titles were given after death to an emperor or king, but unlike the often elaborate posthumous name, a temple name almost always consists of only two characters:an adjective: chosen to reflect the circumstances of the emperor's reign (such as "Martial" or "Lamentable").   The vocabulary overlaps with that of posthumous titles' adjectives, but for one emperor, the temple name's adjective character usually does not repeat as one of the many adjective characters in his posthumous name. 

Protagonist<====>68315<====>Protagonist  A protagonist (  is the main character in any story, such as a literary work or drama.   The protagonist is at the center of the story,  makes the key decisions, and experiences the consequences of those decisions.  The protagonist affects the main characters' circumstances as well, as they are often the primary actor propelling the story forward.  If a story contains a subplot, or is a narrative made up of several stories, then the character who is interpreted as the protagonist of each subplot or individual story.  The word protagonist is used notably in stories and forms of literature and culture that contain stories, which would include dramas, novels, operas and films. 

Heat pump<====>68316<====>Heat pump A heat pump is a device that transfers heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a "heat sink".  Heat pumps are designed to move thermal energy in the opposite direction of spontaneous heat transfer by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one.  A heat pump uses a small amount of external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat sink.  While air conditioners and freezers are familiar examples of heat pumps, the term "heat pump" is more general and applies to many HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) devices used for space heating or space cooling. 

Battle of the Boyne<====>68318<====>Battle of the Boyne The Battle of the Boyne (   ) was a battle in 1690 between the forces of the deposed King James II of England, and those of Dutch Prince William of Orange who, with his wife Mary II (his cousin and James's daughter), had acceded to the Crowns of England and Scotland  in 1688.  The battle took place across the River Boyne near the town of Drogheda in the east of Ireland, and resulted in a victory for William.  This turned the tide in James's failed attempt to regain the British crown and ultimately aided in ensuring the continued Protestant ascendancy in Ireland. 

Cesar Chavez<====>68319<====>Cesar Chavez    Cesar Chavez (born César Estrada Chávez,; March 31, 1927 – April 23, 1993)  was an American labor leader and civil rights activist who, with Dolores Huerta, co-founded the National Farm Workers Association (later the United Farm Workers union, UFW) in 1962.Originally a Mexican American farm worker, Chavez became the best known Latino American civil rights activist, and was strongly promoted by the American labor movement, which was eager to enroll Hispanic members.  His public-relations approach to unionism and aggressive but nonviolent tactics made the farm workers' struggle a moral cause with nationwide support.

Eurovision Song Contest 1957<====>68325<====>Eurovision Song Contest 1957    The Eurovision Song Contest 1957 was the second edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest.  It was held on Sunday 3 March 1957 in Frankfurt-am-Main, West Germany.  It was won by the Netherlands with "Net als toen", performed by Corry Brokken.Like the first 1956 edition, this one was still mainly a radio programme, but there was a noticeable increase in the number of people with televisions. For some time, a rumour had existed that the privilege of hosting the 1957 contest was given to Germany because they had come in second place in 1956 with "Im Wartesaal zum großen Glück" by Walter Andreas Schwarz. 

Extended periodic table<====>68326<====>Extended periodic table  An extended periodic table theorizes about elements beyond oganesson (beyond period 7, or row 7).  Currently seven periods in the periodic table of chemical elements are known and proven, culminating with atomic number (Z) 118, which completes the seventh row. If further elements with higher atomic numbers than this are discovered, they will be placed in additional periods, laid out (as with the existing periods) to illustrate periodically recurring trends in the properties of the elements concerned.  Any additional periods are expected to contain a larger number of elements than the seventh period, as they are calculated to have an additional so-called g-block, containing at least 18 elements with partially filled g-orbitals in each period. 

Basil Rathbone<====>68328<====>Basil Rathbone  Philip St.  John Basil Rathbone MC (13 June 1892 – 21 July 1967) was a South African-born English actor.  He rose to prominence in the United Kingdom as a Shakespearean stage actor and went on to appear in more than 70 films, primarily costume dramas, swashbucklers and, occasionally, horror films. Rathbone frequently portrayed suave villains or morally ambiguous characters, such as Mr.  Murdstone in David Copperfield (1935) and Sir Guy of Gisbourne in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938).  His most famous role, however, was heroic—that of Sherlock Holmes in fourteen Hollywood films made between 1939 and 1946 and in a radio series. 

Frank Jarvis<====>68332<====>Frank Jarvis   Frank Washington Jarvis (August 31, 1878 – June 2, 1933) was an American athlete, and the Olympic 100 m champion of 1900. Jarvis, an AAU champion in the 100 y, was among the pre-race favourites for the 100 m at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, but the hot favourite was American Arthur Duffey, who won the British Championships just prior to the Games. In the heats, however, Jarvis and another American, Walter Tewksbury, posted times of 10. 8, equalling the World Record.  All three Americans qualified for the final, complemented by Stan Rowley of Australia. 

Desktop environment<====>68334<====>Desktop environment In computing, a desktop environment (DE) is an implementation of the desktop metaphor made of a bundle of programs running on top of a computer operating system, which share a common graphical user interface (GUI), sometimes described as a graphical shell.   The desktop environment was seen mostly on personal computers until the rise of mobile computing. Desktop GUIs help the user to easily access and edit files, while they usually do not provide access to all of the features found in the underlying operating system.  Instead, the traditional command-line interface (CLI) is still used when full control over the operating system is required. 

Anna Nicole Smith<====>68335<====>Anna Nicole Smith   Vickie Lynn Hogan, professionally known as Anna Nicole Smith, (November 28, 1967 – February 8, 2007) was an American model, actress and television personality.

Bilirubin<====>68344<====>Bilirubin Bilirubin is a yellow compound that occurs in the normal catabolic pathway that breaks down heme in vertebrates.  This catabolism is a necessary process in the body's clearance of waste products that arise from the destruction of aged red blood cells.  First the hemoglobin gets stripped of the heme molecule which thereafter passes through various processes of porphyrin catabolism, depending on the part of the body in which the breakdown occurs.  For example, the molecules excreted in the urine differ from those in the faeces.   The production of biliverdin from heme is the first major step in the catabolic pathway, after which the enzyme biliverdin reductase performs the second step, producing bilirubin from biliverdin. 

X window manager<====>68345<====>X window manager An X window manager is a window manager which runs on top of the X Window System, a windowing system mainly used on Unix-like systems. Unlike the classic Mac OS, macOS (Apple Macintosh) and Microsoft Windows platforms (excepting Microsoft Windows explorer. exe shell replacements) which have historically provided a vendor-controlled, fixed set of ways to control how windows and panes display on a screen, and how the user may interact with them, window management for the X Window System was deliberately kept separate from the software providing the graphical display.  The user can choose between various third-party window managers, which differ from one another in several ways, including:customizability of appearance and functionality:textual menus used to start programs and/or change optionsdocks and other graphical ways to start programsmultiple desktops and virtual desktops (desktops larger than the physical monitor size), and pagers  to switch between themconsumption of memory and other system resourcesdegree of integration with a desktop environment, which provides a more complete interface to the operating system, and provides a range of integrated utilities and applications. 

The Big Sleep<====>68348<====>The Big Sleep    The Big Sleep (1939) is a hardboiled crime novel by Raymond Chandler, the first to feature the detective Philip Marlowe.  It has been adapted for film twice, in 1946 and again in 1978.  The story is set in Los Angeles. The story is noted for its complexity, with characters double-crossing one another and secrets being exposed throughout the narrative.  The title is a euphemism for death; it refers to a rumination about "sleeping the big sleep" in the final pages of the book. In 1999, the book was voted 96th of Le Monde s "100 Books of the Century". 

HFE hereditary haemochromatosis<====>68349<====>HFE hereditary haemochromatosis  Haemochromatosis (or hemochromatosis) type 1is a hereditary disease characterized by excessive intestinal absorption of dietary iron resulting in a pathological increase in total body iron stores.Humans, like most animals, have no means to excrete excess iron. Excess iron accumulates in tissues and organs disrupting their normal function.  The most susceptible organs include the liver, adrenal glands, heart, skin, gonads, joints, and the pancreas; patients can present with cirrhosis, polyarthropathy, adrenal insufficiency, heart failure or diabetes.  Iron Overload and Hemochromatosis Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  The hereditary form of the disease is most common among those of Northern European ancestry, in particular those of Celtic descent. 

Pattern<====>68351<====>Pattern A pattern is a discernible regularity in the world or in a manmade design.  As such, the elements of a pattern repeat in a predictable manner.  A geometric pattern is a kind of pattern formed of geometric shapes and typically repeated like a wallpaper design. Any of the senses may directly observe patterns.  Conversely, abstract patterns in science, mathematics, or language may be observable only by analysis.  Direct observation in practice means seeing visual patterns, which are widespread in nature and in art.  Visual patterns in nature are often chaotic, never exactly repeating, and often involve fractals. 

Solar furnace<====>68353<====>Solar furnace A solar furnace is a structure that uses concentrated solar power to produce high temperatures, usually for industry.  Parabolic mirrors or heliostats concentrate light (Insolation) onto a focal point.   The temperature at the focal point may reach  , and this heat can be used to generate electricity, melt steel, make hydrogen fuel or nanomaterials. The largest solar furnace is at Odeillo in the Pyrénées-Orientales in France, opened in 1970.   It employs an array of plane mirrors to gather sunlight, reflecting it onto a larger curved mirror. HistoryThe ancient Greek / Latin term heliocaminus literally means "solar furnace" and refers to a glass-enclosed sunroom intentionally designed to become hotter than the outside air temperature. 

René Lalique<====>68360<====>René Lalique René Jules Lalique (6 April 1860, Ay, Marne – 1 May 1945, Paris) was a French glass designer known for his creations of glass art, perfume bottles, vases, jewellery, chandeliers, clocks and automobile hood ornaments. LifeLalique's early life was spent learning the methods of design and art he would use in his later life.   At the age of two, his family moved to the suburbs of Paris, but traveled to Ay for summer holidays.  These trips influenced Lalique' later on in his naturalistic glasswork.  With the death of his father two years later, Lalique began working as an apprentice to goldsmith Louis Aucoc in Paris. 

Chick Hearn<====>68363<====>Chick Hearn Francis Dayle "Chick" Hearn (November 27, 1916 – August 5, 2002) was an American sportscaster.   Known primarily as the play-by-play announcer for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association, Hearn was remembered for his rapid fire, staccato broadcasting style, associated with colorful phrases such as slam dunk, air ball, and no harm, no foul that have become common basketball vernacular, and for broadcasting 3,338 consecutive Lakers games starting on November 21, 1965.  Lakers broadcaster Chick Hearn dies at 85.  Associated Press, August 16, 2002.    Additionally, Hearn started the now common tradition of estimating the distance of shots taken. 

Christian Pineau<====>68364<====>Christian Pineau  Christian Pineau ( ; 14 October 1904, in Chaumont-en-Bassigny, Haute-Marne, France – 5 April 1995, in Paris) was a noted French Resistance fighter, who later served an important term as Minister of Foreign Affairs in the late 1950s. Pineau was born in 1904 in Chaumont-en-Bassigny, Haute-Marne, France.  His stepfather was the writer Jean Giraudoux, who was married to Pineau's mother.  Later, Christian Pineau would say that it was Giraudoux who gave him his love of writing. A World War II French Resistance leader and a close ally of Charles de Gaulle, Pineau was arrested by the Gestapo in 1943 and survived Buchenwald concentration camp. 

Computer chess<====>68367<====>Computer chess Computer chess is  a game of computer architecture encompassing hardware and software capable of playing chess autonomously without human guidance.  Computer chess acts as solo entertainment (allowing players to practice and to better themselves when no sufficiently strong human opponents are available), as aids to chess analysis, for computer chess competitions, and as research to provide insights into human cognition. Current chess engines are able to defeat even the strongest human players under normal conditions.  Whether computation could ever solve chess remains an open question. In December 2017, DeepMind's AlphaZero beats AlphaGo Zero and other top chess and Shōgi programs after only 24 hours of play.

Chess puzzle<====>68385<====>Chess puzzle A chess puzzle is a puzzle in which knowledge of the pieces and rules of chess is used to solve logically a chess-related problem.  The history of chess puzzles reaches back to the Middle Ages and has evolved since then.  Usually the goal is to find the single best, ideally aesthetic move or a series of single best moves in a chess position, which was created by a composer or is from a real game.  But puzzles can also set different objectives.  Examples include deducing the last move played, the location of a missing piece, or whether a player has lost the right to castle.

United States Strategic Bombing Survey<====>68399<====>United States Strategic Bombing Survey The United States Strategic Bombing Survey was a written report created by a board of experts assembled to produce an impartial assessment of the effects of Anglo-American strategic bombing of Nazi Germany during the European theatre of World War II.  After publishing its report, the Survey members then turned their attention to the efforts against Imperial Japan during the Pacific War, including a separate section on the recent use of the atomic bombs. In total, the reports contained 208 volumes for Europe and another 108 for the Pacific, comprising thousands of pages.  The reports' conclusions were generally favourable about the contributions of Allied strategic bombing towards victory, calling it "decisive". 

Chess opening<====>68402<====>Chess opening  A chess opening or simply an opening refers to the initial moves of a chess game.  The term can refer to the initial moves by either side, White or Black, but an opening by Black may also be known as a defense.  There are dozens of different openings, and hundreds of variants.  The Oxford Companion to Chess lists 1,327 named openings and variants.   These vary widely in character fromto wild tactical play.  In addition to referring to specific move sequences, the opening is the first phase of a chess game, the other phases being the middlegame and the endgame.

Yeoman<====>68442<====>Yeoman  A yeoman   was a member of a social class in late medieval to early modern England.   In early recorded uses, a yeoman was an attendant in a noble household;  hence titles such as "Yeoman of the Chamber", "Yeoman of the Crown", "Yeoman Usher", "King's Yeoman", Yeomen Warders, Yeomen of the Guard.  The later sense of yeoman as "a commoner who cultivates his own land" is recorded from the 15th century; in military context, yeoman was the rank of the third order of "fighting men", below knights and squires, but above knaves. A specialized meaning in naval terminology,  "petty officer in charge of supplies", arose in the 1660s.

Abetalipoproteinemia<====>68451<====>Abetalipoproteinemia  Abetalipoproteinemia is a disorder that interferes with the normal absorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins from food.  It is caused by a mutation in microsomal triglyceride transfer protein resulting in deficiencies in the apolipoproteins B-48 and B-100, which are used in the synthesis and exportation of chylomicrons and VLDL respectively.  It is not to be confused with familial dysbetalipoproteinemia. It is a rare autosomal recessive disorder.    PresentationSymptomsOften symptoms will arise that indicate the body is not absorbing or making the lipoproteins that it needs.  These symptoms usually appear en masse, meaning that they happen all together, all the time. 

Basset Hound<====>68453<====>Basset Hound  The Basset Hound is a short-legged breed of dog of the hound family.  The Basset is a scent hound that was originally bred for the purpose of hunting hare.

The Japanese later called this event Night of the Black Snow.  The US first mounted a seaborne, small-scale air raid on Tokyo in April 1942. 

Storyboard<====>68459<====>Storyboard   A storyboard is a graphic organizer in the form of illustrations or images displayed in sequence for the purpose of pre-visualizing a motion picture, animation, motion graphic or interactive media sequence.  The storyboarding process, in the form it is known today, was developed at Walt Disney Productions during the early 1930s, after several years of similar processes being in use at Walt Disney and other animation studios. OriginsMany large budget silent films were storyboarded, but most of this material has been lost during the reduction of the studio archives during the 1970s and 1980s.   Special effects pioneer Georges Méliès is known to have been among the first filmmakers to use storyboards and pre-production art to visualize planned effects. 

LADA 4x4<====>68460<====>LADA 4x4 The LADA 4x4, formerly called the Lada Niva ( ; Niva (нива) is the Russian word for "field"), is an off-road vehicle designed and produced by the Russian (former Soviet) manufacturer AvtoVAZ specifically for the rural market.  It was the first mass production off-road vehicle to feature a unibody architecture, independent front suspension with coil springs, and is a predecessor to current crossover SUVs which nearly all follow this format; it inspired the Suzuki Vitara.  Thompson, p. 238.   Like the Vitara, the Lada 4x4 uses a recirculating ball truck steering box for off-road reliability. 

Cervera<====>68462<====>Cervera  Cervera ( ,  ) is the capital of the comarca of Segarra, in the province of Lleida, Catalonia.

The city is also the birthplace of 4 time MotoGP world champion, Marc Marquez. HistoryThe town and its medieval originsIn the year 1026, three peasant families built the first settlement in the comarca of Segarra, as in those days it was uninhabited.  Later on, the Barcelona counts committed ownership of those lands to those people. 

Ripoll<====>68465<====>Ripoll    Ripoll ( ) is the capital of the comarca of Ripollès, in the province of Girona, Catalonia, Spain.  It is located on confluence of the Ter River and its tributary Freser, next to the Pyrenees near the French border.  The population was 11,057 in 2009. The first traces of humans inhabiting the area date from the Bronze Age and can be seen in form of dolmens such as those found in El Sot de Dones Mortes or in Pardinella.  This area was later used by peoples from the Atlantic culture to store bronze weapons and as a passway from the Catalan Central Depression to the Pyrenees. 

Gamma correction<====>68466<====>Gamma correctionGamma correction, or often simply gamma, is the name of a nonlinear operation used to encode and decode luminance or tristimulus values in video or still image systems.Gamma correction is, in the simplest cases, defined by the following power-law expression: V_{\text{out}} = A {V_{\text{in}}}^{\gamma} where the non-negative real input value  V_{\text{in}}  is raised to the power  \gamma  and multiplied by the constant A, to get the output value  V_{\text{out}} .  In the common case of  , inputs and outputs are typically in the range 0–1. A gamma value   is sometimes called an encoding gamma, and the process of encoding with this compressive power-law nonlinearity is called gamma compression; conversely a gamma value   is called a decoding gamma and the application of the expansive power-law nonlinearity is called gamma expansion. 

Dune buggy<====>68468<====>Dune buggy  A dune buggy or beach buggy is a recreational motor vehicle with large wheels, and wide tires, designed for use on sand dunes, beaches, or desert recreation.  It is called a "Beach Buggy" in the United Kingdom, Ireland and many other English speaking countries. The design is usually a modified vehicle and engine mounted on an open chassis.  The modifications usually attempt to increase the power-to-weight ratio by either lightening the vehicle or increasing engine power or both.  Dune buggies designed specifically for operation on open sand are called sandrails. A similar, more recent generation of off-road vehicle, often similar in appearance to a sandrail but designed for different use, is the "off road go-kart". 

Laparoscopy<====>68469<====>Laparoscopy Laparoscopy ( ) is an operation performed in the abdomen or pelvis through small incisions (usually 0. 5–1. 5 cm) with the aid of a camera.  The laparoscope aids diagnosis or therapeutic interventions with a few small cuts in the abdomen.  MedlinePlus > Laparoscopy Update Date: 8/21/2009.  Updated by: James Lee, MD // No longer valid   There are a number of advantages to the patient with laparoscopic surgery versus an open procedure.  These include reduced pain due to smaller incisions and hemorrhaging, and shorter recovery time.

He studied Oriental, Germanic and Slavic languages, and then served in the army before resuming his studies.  He travelled to Russia in December 1871, spending nearly a year learning the language.  His first scientific paper was Nogle Raskiana (1874). At the same time he began to study the accent of Danish and the Slavic languages. 

Jurassic Park (film)<====>68485<====>Jurassic Park (film)  Jurassic Park is a 1993 American science-fiction adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg and produced by Kathleen Kennedy and Gerald R.  Molen.  The first installment in the Jurassic Park franchise, it is based on the 1990 novel of the same name by Michael Crichton and a screenplay written by Crichton and David Koepp.  The film is set on the fictional island of Isla Nublar, located off Central America's Pacific Coast near Costa Rica, where a billionaire philanthropist and a small team of genetic scientists have created a wildlife park of cloned dinosaurs. Before Crichton's novel was published, four studios put in bids for its film rights. 

Durham, England<====>68489<====>Durham, England   Durham ( , locally  ) is a historic city and the county town of County Durham in North East England.   The city lies on the River Wear, to the west of Sunderland, south of Newcastle upon Tyne and to the north of Darlington.  Founded over the final resting place of St Cuthbert, its Norman cathedral became a centre of pilgrimage in medieval England.

Roe v. Wade<====>68493<====>Roe v.  Wade    Roe v.  Wade,  , is a landmark decision issued in 1973 by the United States Supreme Court on the issue of the constitutionality of laws that criminalized or restricted access to abortions.   The Court ruled 7–2 that a right to privacy under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment extended to a woman's decision to have an abortion, but that this right must be balanced against the state's interests in regulating abortions: protecting women's health and protecting the potentiality of human life.   Arguing that these state interests became stronger over the course of a pregnancy, the Court resolved this balancing test by tying state regulation of abortion to the third trimester of pregnancy. 

Ocean thermal energy conversion<====>68498<====>Ocean thermal energy conversion Ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) uses the temperature difference between cooler deep and warmer shallow or surface seawaters to run a heat engine and produce useful work, usually in the form of electricity.   OTEC can operate with a very high capacity factor and so can operate in base load mode. Among ocean energy sources, OTEC is one of the continuously available renewable energy resources that could contribute to base-load power supply.  Lewis, Anthony, et al.  IPCC: Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation, 2011  The resource potential for OTEC is considered to be much larger than for other ocean energy forms [World Energy Council, 2000]. 

McCabe & Mrs. Miller<====>68501<====>McCabe & Mrs.  Miller McCabe & Mrs.  Miller is a 1971 American Revisionist Western film starring Warren Beatty and Julie Christie, and directed by Robert Altman.  The screenplay is based on the 1959 novel McCabe by Edmund Naughton.    Many editions of the novel in several languages were published subsequent to the release of the film; see    Altman referred to it as an "anti-western film" because the film ignores or subverts a number of Western conventions.   In 2010, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant". 

Fox hunting<====>68502<====>Fox hunting  Fox hunting is an activity involving the tracking, chase and, if caught, the killing of a fox, traditionally a red fox, by trained foxhounds or other scent hounds, and a group of unarmed followers led by a "master of foxhounds" ("master of hounds"), who follow the hounds on foot or on horseback.    Fox hunting with hounds, as a formalised activity, originated in England in the sixteenth century, in a form very similar to that practised until February 2005, when a law banning the activity in England and Wales came into force.A ban on hunting in Scotland had been passed in 2002, but it continues to be within the law in Northern Ireland and several other countries, including Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, Italy, and the United States. 

Pseudometric space<====>68503<====>Pseudometric spaceIn mathematics, a pseudometric space is a generalized metric space in which the distance between two distinct points can be zero.  In the same way as every normed space is a metric space, every seminormed space is a pseudometric space.  Because of this analogy the term semimetric space (which has a different meaning in topology) is sometimes used as a synonym, especially in functional analysis. When a topology is generated using a family of pseudometrics, the space is called a gauge space. DefinitionA pseudometric space  (X,d)  is a set  X  together with a non-negative real-valued function  d\colon X \times X \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}  (called a pseudometric) such that, for every  x,y,z \in X , d(x,x)=0 . 

Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949<====>68510<====>Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949  The Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949  are two  Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, which form part of the constitution of the United Kingdom.  Section 2(2) of the Parliament Act 1949 provides that the two Acts are to be construed as one. The Parliament Act 1911 (1 & 2 Geo.  5.  c.  13) asserted the supremacy of the House of Commons by limiting the legislation-blocking powers of the House of Lords (the suspensory veto).  Provided the provisions of the Act are met, legislation can be passed without the approval of the House of Lords. 

Surface science<====>68513<====>Surface scienceSurface science is the study of physical and chemical phenomena that occur at the interface of two phases, including solid–liquid interfaces, solid–gas interfaces, solid–vacuum interfaces, and liquid–gas interfaces.  It includes the fields of surface chemistry and surface physics.   Some related practical applications are classed as surface engineering.  The science encompasses concepts such as heterogeneous catalysis, semiconductor device fabrication, fuel cells, self-assembled monolayers, and adhesives.  Surface science is closely related to interface and colloid science.   Interfacial chemistry and physics are common subjects for both.  The methods are different.  In addition, interface and colloid science studies macroscopic phenomena that occur in heterogeneous systems due to peculiarities of interfaces. 

Pedro de Valdivia<====>68517<====>Pedro de Valdivia Pedro Gutiérrez de Valdivia or Valdiva (April 17, 1497 – December 25, 1553 ) was a Spanish conquistador and the first royal governor of Chile.  After serving with the Spanish army in Italy and Flanders, he was sent to South America in 1534, where he served as lieutenant under Francisco Pizarro in Peru, acting as his second in command.  In 1540 he led an expedition of 150 Spaniards into Chile, where he defeated a large force of indigenous natives and founded Santiago in 1541.  He extended Spanish rule south to the Bío-Bío River in 1546, fought again in Peru (1546 – 48), and returned to Chile as governor in 1549. 

Chemisorption<====>68518<====>ChemisorptionChemisorption is a kind of adsorption which involves a chemical reaction between the surface and the adsorbate.   New chemical bonds are generated at the adsorbant surface.   Examples include macroscopic phenomena that can be very obvious, like corrosion, and subtler effects associated with heterogeneous catalysis.  The strong interaction between the adsorbate and the substrate surface creates new types of electronic bonds.    In contrast with chemisorption is physisorption, which leaves the chemical species of the adsorbate and surface intact.  It is conventionally accepted that the energetic threshold separating the binding energy of "physisorption" from that of "chemisorption" is about 0.

Physisorption<====>68520<====>PhysisorptionPhysisorption, also called physical adsorption, is a process in which the electronic structure of the atom or molecule is barely perturbed upon adsorption. IntroductionThe fundamental interacting force of physisorption is caused by van der Waals force.  Even though the interaction energy is very weak (~10–100 meV), physisorption plays an important role in nature.   For instance, the van der Waals attraction between surfaces and foot-hairs of geckos provides the remarkable ability to climb up vertical walls.    Van der Waals forces originate from the interactions between induced, permanent or transient electric dipoles.

Raman spectroscopy<====>68686<====>Raman spectroscopyRaman spectroscopy ( ; named after Indian physicist Sir C.  V.  Raman) is a spectroscopic technique used to observe vibrational, rotational, and other low-frequency modes in a system. Raman spectroscopy is commonly used in chemistry to provide a structural fingerprint by which molecules can be identified. It relies on inelastic scattering, or Raman scattering, of monochromatic light, usually from a laser in the visible, near infrared, or near ultraviolet range.  The laser light interacts with molecular vibrations, phonons or other excitations in the system, resulting in the energy of the laser photons being shifted up or down. 

1926 United Kingdom general strike<====>68688<====>1926 United Kingdom general strike   The 1926 general strike in the United Kingdom was a general strike that lasted 9 days, from 3 May 1926 to 12 May 1926.

Attention<====>68753<====>Attention  Attention is the behavioral and cognitive process of selectively concentrating on a discrete aspect of information, whether deemed subjective or objective, while ignoring other perceivable information.  It is the taking possession by the mind in clear and vivid form of one out of what seem several simultaneous objects or trains of thought.  Focalization, concentration of consciousness are of its essence.  Attention has also been referred to as the allocation of limited processing resources.  Attention remains a major area of investigation within education, psychology, neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, and neuropsychology.  Areas of active investigation involve determining the source of the sensory cues and signals that generate attention, the effects of these sensory cues and signals on the tuning properties of sensory neurons, and the relationship between attention and other behavioral and cognitive processes like working memory and vigilance. 

Market failure<====>68754<====>Market failureIn economics, market failure is a situation in which the allocation of goods and services is not efficient.  That is, there exists another conceivable outcome where at least one individual may be made better-off without making someone else worse-off.  Market failures can be viewed as scenarios where individuals' pursuit of pure self-interest leads to results that are not efficient – that can be improved upon from the societal point of view.   Paul Krugman and Robin Wells (2006).  Economics, New York, Worth Publishers.   The first known use of the term by economists was in 1958, Francis M. 

Human tooth<====>68756<====>Human tooth  The human teeth function to mechanically break down items of food by cutting and crushing them in preparation for swallowing and digesting.  Humans have four types of teeth: incisors, canines, premolars, and molars, each with a specific function.  The incisors cut the food, the canines tear the food and the molars and premolars crush the food.   The roots of teeth are embedded in the maxilla (upper jaw) or the mandible (lower jaw) and are covered by gums.  Teeth are made of multiple tissues of varying density and hardness. Teeth are among the most distinctive (and long-lasting) features of mammal species. 

Eurovision Song Contest 1969<====>68757<====>Eurovision Song Contest 1969 The Eurovision Song Contest 1969 was the 14th in the series. Four countries (the United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands and France) won the contest, the first time ever a tie-break situation had occurred.   However, there was no rule at the time to cover such an eventuality, so all four countries were declared joint winners.    France's win was their fourth.  France became the first country to win the contest four times.  The Netherlands' win was their third.  Spain and the United Kingdom each won for the second time.  And it was the first time that any country (Spain, in this case) had a winning ESC entry two years in a row. 

Kaldor–Hicks efficiency<====>68759<====>Kaldor–Hicks efficiency  A Kaldor–Hicks improvement, named for Nicholas Kaldor and John Hicks, is an economic re-allocation of resources among people that captures some of the intuitive appeal of a Pareto improvement, but has less stringent criteria and is hence applicable to more circumstances.  A re-allocation is a Kaldor–Hicks improvement if those that are made better off could hypothetically compensate those that are made worse off and lead to a Pareto-improving outcome.  The compensation does not actually have to occur (there is no presumption in favor of status-quo) and thus, a Kaldor–Hicks improvement can in fact leave some people worse off. 

Connection Machine<====>68760<====>Connection MachineA Connection Machine (CM) is a member of a series of massively parallel supercomputers that grew out of doctoral research on alternatives to the traditional von Neumann architecture of computers by Danny Hillis at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the early 1980s.  Starting with CM-1, the machines were intended originally for applications in artificial intelligence and symbolic processing, but later versions found greater success in the field of computational science. Origin of idea Danny Hillis and Sheryl Handler founded Thinking Machines Corporation (TMC) in Waltham, Massachusetts in 1983, moving in 1984 to Cambridge, MA.   At TMC, Hillis assembled a team to develop what would become the CM-1 Connection Machine, a design for a massively parallel hypercube-based arrangement of thousands of microprocessors, springing from this PhD thesis work at MIT in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (1985).

Colloquialism<====>68765<====>Colloquialism Everyday language, everyday speech, common parlance, informal language, colloquial language, general parlance, or vernacular (but this has other meanings too), is the most used variety of a language, which is usually employed in conversation or other communication in informal situations. An example of such language is called a colloquialism, or casualism.  The most common term used by dictionaries to label such an expression is colloquial.  Many people however misunderstand this label and confuse it with the word local because it sounds somewhat similar  and because informal expressions are often only used in certain regions.  (But a regionalism is not the same thing as a colloquialism, and a regionalism can be local formal speech). 

Kingdom of Strathclyde<====>68767<====>Kingdom of Strathclyde  Strathclyde (lit.  "Strath of the River Clyde"), originally   or Alclud (and Strath-Clota in Anglo-Saxon), was one of the early medieval kingdoms of the Britons in Hen Ogledd ("the Old North"), the Brythonic-speaking parts of what is now southern Scotland and northern England.  The kingdom developed during the post-Roman period.  It is also known as Alt Clut, a Brittonic term for Dumbarton Castle, the medieval capital of the region.  It may have had its origins with the Brythonic Damnonii people of Ptolemy's Geography. The language of Strathclyde, and that of the Britons in surrounding areas under non-native rulership, is known as Cumbric, a dialect or language closely related to Old Welsh, and in modern terms to Welsh, Cornish and Breton.

Equity (finance)<====>68804<====>Equity (finance)   In accounting, equity (or owner's equity) is the difference between the value of the assets and the value of the liabilities of something owned.  It is governed by the following equation:  \text{Equity} = \text{Assets} - \text{Liabilities}  For example, if someone owns a car worth $15,000 (an asset), but owes $5,000 on a loan against that car (a liability), the car represents $10,000 of equity.  Equity can be negative if liabilities exceed assets.  Shareholders' equity (or stockholders' equity, shareholders' funds, shareholders' capital or similar terms) represents the equity of a company as divided among shareholders of common or preferred stock.

Ziklag has other popular name; Haluza (slightly clearer in the underlying Hebrew script than in English), meaning fortress; Khirbet Zuheiliqah was identified by Conder and Kitchener as the location on the basis of Ziklag being a corruption of Zahaliku.

Moral Politics (book)<====>68818<====>Moral Politics (book) Moral Politics: How Liberals and Conservatives Think is a 1996 book by cognitive linguist George Lakoff.  It argues that conservatives and liberals hold two different conceptual models of morality.  Conservatives have a strict father model in which people are made good through self-discipline and hard work, everyone is taken care of by taking care of themselves.    Liberals have a nurturant parent model in which everyone is taken care of by helping each other. The first edition of the book was published with the subtitle What Conservatives Know That Liberals Don't. The bookMoral Politics has two different purposes. 

Naturopathy<====>68819<====>Naturopathy   Naturopathy or naturopathic medicine is a form of alternative medicine that employs an array of pseudoscientific practices branded as "natural", "non-invasive", and as promoting "self-healing".  The ideology and methods of naturopathy are based on vitalism and folk medicine, rather than evidence-based medicine.   Naturopathic practitioners generally recommend against modern medical practices, including but not limited to medical testing, drugs, vaccinations, and surgery.Instead, naturopathic study and practice rely on unscientific notions, often leading naturopathic doctors to diagnoses and treatments that have no factual merit.Naturopathic medicine is considered by the medical profession to be ineffective and possibly harmful, raising ethical issues about its practice. 

Daughters of Zelophehad<====>68821<====>Daughters of Zelophehad The Daughters of Zelophehad ( ) were five sisters - Mahlah, Noa, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah - mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, (Numbers 27) who lived at the end of the Israelites' Exodus from Egypt as they prepared to enter the Promised Land and who raised before the Israelite community the case of a woman's right and obligation to inherit property in the absence of a male heir in the family.  Zelophehad (meaning "dark shadow"), a man of the Tribe of Manasseh, had five daughters but no sons, and therefore no male heirs.  Biblical accountThe biblical text tells little of Zelophehad himself, save that he died during the 40 years when the Israelites were wandering in the wilderness, and explicitly that he played no part in Korah's rebellion.

It was selected by and named to honour Joshua Pritchard Hughes, Bishop of Llandaff, in 1924 and won the RHS Award of Garden Merit in 1928.   The plant is about 1 m tall and flowers from June until September.  As with all dahlias, frost blackens its foliage, and its tubers need to be overwintered in a dry, frost-free place.

Economy of Barbados<====>68939<====>Economy of Barbados  Since achieving independence in 1966, the island nation of Barbados has transformed itself from a High-income economy dependent upon "sugar" production, into an upper-middle-income economy based on tourism and the offshore sector.  Barbados went into a deep recession in the 1990s after 3 years of steady decline brought on by fundamental macroeconomic imbalances.  After a painful re-adjustment process, the economy began to grow again in 1993.  Growth rates have averaged between 3%–5% since then.  The country's three main economic drivers are: tourism, the international business sector, and foreign direct-investment.  These are supported in part by Barbados operating as a service-driven economy and an international business centre. 

Telecommunications in Barbados<====>68940<====>Telecommunications in BarbadosCommunications in Barbados refers to the telephony, Internet, postal, radio, and television systems of Barbados.   Barbados has long been an informational and communications centre in the Caribbean region.   Electricity coverage throughout Barbados is good and reliable.  Usage is high and provided by a service monopoly, Barbados Light & Power Company Ltd.  (a division of Canada-based Emera). The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) call sign prefix allocated for all radio and television broadcasts in Barbados is 8P, and this replaced the former ZN as a British territory.

Barbados has   of public paved roads,  two active marine ports in (Bridgetown Port and Port Saint Charles), remnants of a railway system, and one airport; the Sir Grantley Adams International Airport, located in Christ Church. RoadwaysAs a former British colony, Barbados was heavily influenced by the English culture and customs which carried over into the infrastructure of Barbados. 

Military history of Barbados<====>68943<====>Military history of Barbados Throughout the colonial history of Barbados, Britain routinely stationed large segments of its West India regimental troops on the island of Barbados.   The troops acted principally as a force to secure the island against any invasion by other European powers as well as to help protect other neighbouring British territories in the Eastern Caribbean from invasion.  Militia numbers were substantially increased after a series of slave revolts in the West Indies—including Barbados—during the first quarter of the 19th century.  So successful were British colonial troop deployments to Barbados, it has been said that Barbados is the only country in the Caribbean region never to have changed hands since the British first landed and established the city of Jamestown (around the first quarter century of the 17th century) until independence. 

Tribe of Naphtali<====>68944<====>Tribe of Naphtali The Tribe of Naphtali ( ) was one of the twelve tribes of Israel.  It was one of the northernmost of the tribes.  Biblical NarrativeIn the biblical account, following the completion of the conquest of Canaan by the Israelite Joshua allocated the land among the twelve tribes.  Kenneth Kitchen, a well-known conservative biblical scholar, dates this event to slightly after 1200 BCE.  Kitchen, Kenneth A.

It then resumed its long-term growth, rising to 10 million in 1999.   After that the population began a steady decline, dropping to 9. 7 million in 2006–2007. 

Born–Oppenheimer approximation<====>68946<====>Born–Oppenheimer approximation  In quantum chemistry and molecular physics, the Born–Oppenheimer (BO) approximation is the assumption that the motion of atomic nuclei and electrons in a molecule can be separated.  The approach is named after Max Born and J.  Robert Oppenheimer.  In mathematical terms, it allows the wavefunction of a molecule to be broken into its electronic and nuclear (vibrational, rotational) components.   \Psi_\mathrm{total} = \psi_\mathrm{electronic} \times \psi_\mathrm{nuclear}  Computation of the energy and the wavefunction of an average-size molecule is simplified by the approximation.   For example, the benzene molecule consists of 12 nuclei and 42 electrons.

Biblical accountThe Tribe of Judah, its conquests, and the centrality of its capital in Jerusalem for the worship of the god Yahweh figure prominently in the Deuteronomistic history, encompassing the books of Deuteronomy through II Kings, which most scholars agree was reduced to written form, although subject to exilic and post-exilic alterations and emendations, during the reign of the Judahist reformer Josiah from 641–609 BCE.    According to the account in the Book of Joshua, following a partial conquest of Canaan by the Israelite tribes (the Jebusites still held Jerusalem), Kitchen, Kenneth A. 

Foreign relations of Belgium<====>68953<====>Foreign relations of BelgiumBelgium is a country in Europe and member of major international organizations like the European Union and NATO which are both headquartered in Brussels, Belgium. As a federal state, the Communities and Regions have their own foreign relations and are able to conclude treaties themselves. Initial neutralityBecause of its location at the crossroads of Western Europe, Belgium has historically been the route of invading armies from its larger neighbours.  With virtually defenceless borders, Belgium has traditionally sought to avoid domination by the more powerful nations which surround it through a policy of mediation.  The Concert of Europe sanctioned the creation of Belgium in 1831 on the condition that the country remain strictly neutral. 

Nostril<====>68954<====>Nostril  A nostril (or naris  , plural nares  ) is one of the two channels of the nose, from the point where they bifurcate to the external opening.   In birds and mammals, they contain branched bones or cartilages called turbinates, whose function is to warm air on inhalation and remove moisture on exhalation.  Fish do not breathe through their noses, but they do have two small holes used for smelling, which may, indeed, be called nostrils. The Procellariiformes are distinguished from other birds by having tubular extensions of their nostrils. In humans, the nasal cycle is the normal ultradian cycle of each nostril's blood vessels becoming engorged in swelling, then shrinking. 

Tribe of Ephraim<====>68957<====>Tribe of Ephraim According to the  Hebrew Bible, the Tribe of Ephraim ( ) was one of the Tribes of Israel.

The descendants of Joseph formed two of the tribes of Israel, whereas the other sons of Jacob were the founders of one tribe each. 

Object-relational database<====>68960<====>Object-relational database An object-relational database (ORD), or object-relational database management system (ORDBMS), is a database management system (DBMS) similar to a relational database, but with an object-oriented database model: objects, classes and inheritance are directly supported in database schemas and in the query language.   In addition, just as with pure relational systems, it supports extension of the data model with custom data-types and methods. An object-relational database can be said to provide a middle ground between relational databases and object-oriented databases (object database).  In object-relational databases, the approach is essentially that of relational databases: the data resides in the database and is manipulated collectively with queries in a query language; at the other extreme are OODBMSes in which the database is essentially a persistent object store for software written in an object-oriented programming language, with a programming API for storing and retrieving objects, and little or no specific support for querying.

There are also two marine ports (Hamilton and St.  George's), and an airport, the L. F.  Wade International Airport, located at the former U. S.  Naval Air Station.  A causeway links Hamilton Parish, Bermuda to St.  George's and the airport. As in the United Kingdom, traffic drives on the left, meaning that visitors from countries with right-hand traffic must take special care on Bermuda's roads. 

Military of Bermuda<====>68990<====>Military of Bermuda The defence of Bermuda remains the responsibility of the United Kingdom Government, rather than of the Bermudian Government.  Despite this, the Bermuda Government was historically responsible for maintaining Militia for the defence of the Colony. HistoryBermuda became the primary Royal Navy headquarters and dockyard in the Western Atlantic, following American independence, there was a parallel build-up of military defences to protect the naval base.  Seeing the militia as having become superfluous, with the large number of regular soldiers then present, the Colonial Government allowed it to lapse after the American War of 1812, however, it did raise volunteer units at the end of the century to form a reserve for the military garrison. 

Tomb<====>68993<====>Tomb   A tomb (from   tumbos) τύμβος,Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library  is a repository for the remains of the dead. It is generally any structurally enclosed interment space or burial chamber, of varying sizes.OverviewThe word is used in a broad sense to encompass a number of such types of places of interment or, occasionally, burial, including:Architectural shrines – in Christianity, an architectural shrine above a saint's first place of burial, as opposed to a similar   on which stands a reliquary or feretory into which the saint's remains have been transferredBurial vault – a stone or brick-lined underground space for multiple burials, originally vaulted, often privately owned for specific family groups; usually beneath a religious building such as a church or in a churchyard or cemeteryChurch monument – within a church (or a tomb-style chest in a churchyard) may be a place of interment, but this is unusual; it may more commonly stand over the grave or burial vault rather than containing the actual body and therefore is not a tomb.Crypts – often, though not always, for interment; similar to burial vaults but usually for more general public intermentHypogeum tomb - stone-built underground structure for interment, such as the tombs of ancient EgyptKokh (tomb) – a rectangular rock-cut sloping space, running inward, like tunnels into rock, sufficiently high and wide to permit the admission of a corpseMartyrium – Mausoleum for the remains of martyrs, such as San Pietro in MontorioMausoleum (including ancient pyramid in some countries) – external free-standing structure, above ground, acting as both monument and place of interment, usually for individuals or a family groupMegalithic tomb (including Chamber tomb) – prehistoric place of interment, often for large communities, constructed of large stones and originally covered with an earthen moundPillar tomb – a monumental grave. Its central feature is a single, prominent pillar or column, often made of stone.Rock-cut tomb – a form widespread in the ancient world, in which the tomb is not built but carved out of the rock and can be a free-standing building but is more commonly a cave, which may be extensive and may or may not have an elaborate facade.Sarcophagus – a stone container for a body or coffin, often decorated and perhaps part of a monument; it may stand within a religious building or greater tomb or mausoleum.Sepulchre – a cavernous rock-cut space for interment, generally in the Jewish or Christian faiths (cf. Holy Sepulchre).   Samadhi – in India a tomb for a deceased saint that often has a larger building over it as a shrineOther forms of archaeological "tombs", such as ship burialsTumulus – (plural: tumuli) A mound of earth and stones raised over a grave or graves. Tumuli are also known as barrows, burial mounds, Hügelgräber or kurgans, and can be found throughout much of the world. A cairn (a mound of stones built for various purposes), might also be originally a tumulus. A long barrow is a long tumulus, usually for numbers of burials.As indicated, tombs are generally located in or under religious buildings, such as churches, or in cemeteries or churchyards. However, they may also be found in catacombs, on private land or, in the case of early or pre-historic tombs, in what is today open landscape.The Daisen Kofun, the tomb of Emperor Nintoku (the 16th Emperor of Japan), is the largest in the world by area.  However, the Pyramid of Khufu in Egypt is the largest by volume.See alsoCadaver tombCatacombs of RomeChurch monumentDartmoor kistvaensDeath in Norse paganismEnglish church monumentsFunerary artGraveOssuaryList of extant papal tombsList of mausoleaList of non-extant papal tombsList of tombs and mausoleumsSamadhi (shrine)TürbeReferences    

Tishbite<====>68994<====>Tishbite Tishbite is a demonym predicated of the Prophet Elijah in the Hebrew Bible ( ,  ,   and  ).  Scholars dispute the precise denotation of the word.  The words of 1 Kings 17:1 are usually rendered as "Elijah the Tishbite of Tishbe in Gilead".  As translated into English, Tishbite is the demonym for Tishbe: the demonym is predicated of the prophet to denote that his residence or possibly his birthplace was Tishbe. Alternatively, the words of 1 Kings 17:1 could be rendered as "Elijah the dweller from among the inhabitants in Gilead", because in that verse "Tishbite" and the word denoting inhabitants are very similar. 

Fernando Collor de Mello<====>68997<====>Fernando Collor de MelloFernando Affonso Collor de Mello ( ; born August 12, 1949) is a Brazilian politician who served as the 32nd President of Brazil from 1990 to 1992, when he resigned in a failed attempt to stop his trial of impeachment by the Brazilian Senate.  Collor was the first President directly elected by the people after the end of the Brazilian military government.  He became the youngest President in Brazilian history, taking office at the age of 40. After his resignation from the presidency, the impeachment trial on charges of corruption continued, and Collor was found guilty by the Senate and sentenced to disqualification from holding elected office for eight years (1992–2000).

It is fairly evenly sandwiched between the sovereign territory of two nations: first, the People's Republic of China on the north and northwest. There are approximately 477 kilometres of border with that nation's Tibet Autonomous Region. The second nation is the Republic of India on the south, southwest, and east; there are approximately 659 kilometres with the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, West Bengal, and Sikkim, in clockwise order from the kingdom. Bhutan's total borders amount to 1,139 kilometres. The Republic of Nepal to the west, the People's Republic of Bangladesh to the south, and the Union of Myanmar to the southeast are other close neighbours; the former two are separated by only very small stretches of Indian territory.Bhutan is a very compact nation, but with just a small bit more length than width. The nation's territory totals an approximate 46,500 square kilometres. Because of its inland, landlocked status, it controls no territorial waters. Bhutan's territory used to extend south into present-day Assam, including the protectorate of Cooch Behar, but, starting from 1772, the British East India Company began to push back the borders through a number of wars and treaties, severely reducing Bhutan's size until the Treaty of Sinchula of 1865, when some border land was ceded back. Later, many of these territories were permanently lost to British India under the Treaty of Punakha.Political geographyBhutan is divided into 20 dzongkhags (districts), and further into 205 gewogs (village blocks). Gewogs are in turn divided into numerous thromdes (municipalities) for administration.Natural geographyThe Himalaya mountains of Bhutan dominate the north of the country, where peaks can easily reach  ; the highest point in Bhutan is Gangkhar Puensum, which has the distinction of being the highest unclimbed mountain in the world, at  .  Weather is extreme in the mountains: the high peaks have perpetual snow, and the lesser mountains and hewn gorges have high winds all year round, making them barren brown wind tunnels in summer, and frozen wastelands in winter. The blizzards generated in the north each winter often drift southward into the central highlands.Below the rock and ice of the highest peaks lies an extensive arc of Eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows, which contain, in additions to grasslands, a wide variety of rhododendrons and herbaceous plants.The highlands are the most populous part of the nation; the capital Thimphu lies in the western region. The region is characterised by its many rivers (flowing into India's Brahmaputra), its isolated valleys that house most of the population, and the expansive forests that cover seventy percent of the nation. The highlands have Eastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests at higher elevations and Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests at lower elevations. Winters are cold, summer are hot; the rainy season is accompanied with frequented landslides.The valleys of Bhutan are linked by a series of passes ("La" in Dzongkha). Between the Haa valley and Paro Valley is the Chele La ( ). The Chele La is the highest pass crossed by a Bhutanese highway. The Lateral Road from Thimphu to Punakha crosses the Dochu La ( ), which features 108 chortens built to commemorate the expulsion of Assamese guerrillas. East of Wangdue Phodrang is the Pele La ( ). Continuing to the east along the main highway, other major passes include the Yotang La, Shertang La, Wangthang La, Thrumshing La and Kori La ( ).The extreme southern strip of the nation consists mostly of Himalayan subtropical broadleaf forests that grade into the tropical plains of the Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands, more typical of India. It is largely agricultural land, producing mostly rice. Only two percent of Bhutan is arable land, with most of it focused here.Centuries of isolationism, a small population, and topographical extremes have led to Bhutan maintaining one of the most intact ecosystems in the world. The country ranks amongst the top ten countries in the world in terms of species density (species richness per unit area). Over fifty-five hundred varieties of plant life exist, including around three-hundred medicinal ones. More than 770 species of avifauna and more than 165 species of mammals are known to exist, including many rare and endangered species like the red panda, snow leopard, and golden langur.Strategic locationBhutan, situated between India and China, is a potential Sino-Indian battleground; India currently has more political influence in the nation. This stems from two things: the fact that after the British granted sovereignty to their South Asian possessions, Bhutan, a protectorate, was never put under the administration of India, except for its Foreign Relation Policies under the Indo-Bhutan Treaty of 1949.  The Indian Army patrols Bhutan's frontiers and has played a major role in the development of the country's road infrastructure. Additionally, the Government of India continues to provide approximately 60% of Bhutan's government finances.The second reason comes from the aggression against Tibet by China from 1949 to 1959; the Tibetans have strong cultural, historical, and religious connections to Bhutan.Bhutan controls several strategic mountain passes through the Himalayas, allowing travel between Tibet and Assam. These passes are also the only way into the kingdom, and, coupled with its centuries-old policies of isolationism, it has been called the "Mountain Fortress of the Gods." The heartland of Bhutan has never been successfully invaded; the British, while establishing a protectorate over the nation, did so with threats to the low-lying territories below the highlands.ClimateBhutan's climate is as varied as its altitudes and, like India's, is affected by monsoons. Western Bhutan is particularly affected by monsoons that bring between 60 and 90 percent of the region's rainfall. The climate is humid and subtropical in the southern plains and foothills, temperate in the inner Himalayan valleys of the southern and central regions, and cold in the north, with year-round snow on the main Himalayan summits.   Temperatures vary according to elevation. Temperatures in Thimphu, located at   above sea level in west-central Bhutan, range from approximately   during the monsoon season of June through September but drop to between about   in January. Most of the central portion of the country experiences a cool, temperate climate year-round. In the south, a hot, humid climate helps maintain a fairly even temperature range of between   year-round, although temperatures sometimes reach   in the valleys during the summer. Annual precipitation ranges widely in various parts of the country. In the severe climate of the north, there is only about   of annual precipitation—primarily snow. In the temperate central regions, a yearly average of around   is more common, and   per year has been registered at some locations in the humid, subtropical south, ensuring the thick tropical forest, or savanna. Thimphu experiences dry winter months (December through February) and almost no precipitation until March, when rainfall averages   a month and increases steadily thereafter to a high of   in August for a total annual rainfall of nearly  . Bhutan's generally dry spring starts in early March and lasts until mid-April. Summer weather commences in mid-April with occasional showers and continues through the premonsoon rains of late June. The summer monsoon lasts from late June through late September with heavy rains from the southwest. The monsoon weather, blocked from its northward progress by the Himalayas, brings heavy rains, high humidity, flash floods and landslides, and numerous misty, overcast days. Autumn, from late September or early October to late November, follows the rainy season. It is characterised by bright, sunny days and some early snowfalls at higher elevations. From late November until March, winter sets in, with frost throughout much of the country and snowfall common above elevations of  . The winter northeast monsoon brings gale-force winds down through high mountain passes. Glaciers Glaciers in northern Bhutan, which covered about 10 percent of the total surface area in the 1980s, are an important renewable source of water for Bhutan's rivers. Fed by fresh snow each winter and slow melting in the summer, the glaciers bring millions of litres of fresh water to Bhutan and downriver areas each year. Glacial melt adds to monsoon-swollen rivers, however, also contributes to flooding. Where glacial movement temporary blocks riverflows, downstream areas may be threatened by glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), also called jökulhlaups.   Bhutan's glaciers are melting. A 2008 United Nations report suggested that due to rising temperatures, glaciers in Bhutan were retreating at a rate of 30–40 meters per year, poised to make many lakes burst their banks and send millions of gallons of floodwater downstream. This among many other climate-related issues identified in the report prompted the regional association of government ministers to establish the Southeast Asia Regional Health Emergency Fund in Thimphu in September 2007.  Similarly, the member nations of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) adopted bilateral agreements including measures on climate change and glaciers at its summit in April 2010. The 2008 UN report also indicated Himalayan glaciers would melt within 25 years,    however Prime Minister Jigme Thinley expressed a more dim outlook in a press conference in late March 2010, stating, "Our glaciers are withdrawing very fast and we have reasons to worry that they may in fact disappear not in 2035, but even earlier."   Lakes Bhutan is home to at least 59 natural mountain lakes as well as some 2,674 glacial lakes; about 25 of these glacial lakes are potential GLOF hazards. Non-glacial lakes in Bhutan cover a total of about  . Most are located above an altitude of  , and most have no permanent human settlements nearby, though many are used for grazing yaks and may have scattered temporary settlements. River systems Bhutan has four major river systems: the Drangme Chhu; the Puna Tsang Chhu, also called the Sankosh; the Wang Chhu; and the Amo Chhu. Each flows swiftly out of the Himalayas, southerly through the Dooars to join the Brahmaputra River in India, and thence through Bangladesh where the Brahmaputra (or Jamuna in Bangladesh) joins the mighty Ganges (or Padma in Bangladesh) to flow into the Bay of Bengal. The largest river system, the Drangme Chhu, flows southwesterly from India's state of Arunachal Pradesh and has three major branches: the Drangme Chhu, Mangde Chhu, and Bumthang Chhu. These branches form the Drangme Chhu basin, which spreads over most of eastern Bhutan and drains the Tongsa and Bumthang valleys. In the Duars, where eight tributaries join it, the Drangme Chhu is called the Manas Chhu. The 320-kilometer-long Puna Tsang Chhu rises in northwestern Bhutan as the Mo Chhu and Pho Chhu, which are fed by the snows from the Great Himalayan Range. They flow southerly to Punakha, where they join to form the Puna Tsang Chhu, which flows southerly into India's state of West Bengal. The tributaries of the 370-kilometer-long Wang Chhu rise in Tibet. The Wang Chhu itself flows southeasterly through west-central Bhutan, drains the Ha, Paro, and Thimphu valleys, and continues into the Duars, where it enters West Bengal as the Raigye Chhu. The smallest river system, the Torsa Chhu, known as the Amo Chhu in its northern reaches, also flows out of Tibet into the Chumbi Valley and swiftly through western Bhutan before broadening near Phuntsholing and then flowing into India.   Valleys Bhutan's valleys are carved into the Himalaya by its rivers, fed by glacial melt and monsoon rains. Much of the Bhutanese population is concentrated in valleys and lowlands, separated by rugged southward spurs of the Inner Himalaya. Despite modernization and development of transport in Bhutan, including a national highway system, travel from one valley to the next remains difficult.    Western valleys are bound to the east by the Black Mountains in central Bhutan, which form a watershed between two major river systems, the Mo Chhu (Sankosh River) and the Drangme Chhu. Central valleys are separated from the east by the Donga Range. The more isolated mountain valleys protect several tiny, distinct cultural and linguistic groups.   References

Bhutan's bimodal population estimatesThe Royal Government of Bhutan listed the country's population as 752,700 in 2003.  One explanation for this discrepancy is that the higher CIA numbers ultimately trace back to an inflated population number the Bhutanese government supplied to the United Nations in the early 1970s in order to gain entry into that body  (the UN reportedly had a cutoff population of one million at that time). 

Politics of Bhutan<====>69004<====>Politics of Bhutan  The Government of Bhutan has been a constitutional monarchy since 18 July 2008.   The King of Bhutan is the head of state.

Paro Airport is the only airport which accommodates international flights.  As part of Bhutan's infrastructure modernization programs, its road system has been under development since the 1960s.  There are no railways (although one is planned) and, since Bhutan is a landlocked country without major waterways, there are no ports. RoadBhutan had a total of   of roads in 2003,   of which were paved and   unpaved.Because of the lack of paved roads, travel in Bhutan was by foot or on mule- or horseback until 1961; the   trip from the Indian border to Thimphu took six days.

The legitimate heir of Thomas I of Savoy and Margaret of Geneva, he had however to fight with his brothers for the inheritance of Savoy lands after their father's death.  His brothers Pietro and Aimone spurred a revolt in Aosta Valley against Amadeus, but he was able to crush it with the help of Manfred III of Saluzzo and Boniface II of Montferrat, who were his sons-in-law.  Together with his brother, Thomas, he fought against the communes of Turin and Pinerolo, but with uncertain results. 

Geography of Bolivia<====>69011<====>Geography of BoliviaThe geography of Bolivia is unique among the nations of South America.  Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries on the continent (the other being Paraguay), and Bolivia is more urban (67%) than rural (23%).  The main features of  Bolivia's geography include the Altiplano, a highland plateau of the Andes, and Lake Titicaca, the highest navigable lake on Earth, which is shared with Peru.  The most prominent feature of the Altiplano is the large lake at its northern end, Lake Titicaca.  At   above sea level, it is the highest commercially navigable body of water in the world. 

Demographics of Bolivia<====>69012<====>Demographics of Bolivia  The demographic characteristics of the population of Bolivia are known through censuses, with the first in 1826 and the most recent being in 2012.  The National Institute of Statistics of Bolivia (INE) has performed this task since 1950.  The population of Bolivia in 2012 had reached 10 million for the first time in history.  The population density is 9. 13 inhabitants per square kilometer, and the overall life expectancy in Bolivia at birth is 68. 2 years.  The population has steadily risen from the late 1800s to the present time.  The natural growth rate of the population is positive, which has been a continuing trend since the 1950s; in 2012, Bolivia's birth rate continued to be higher than the death rate. 

Politics of Bolivia<====>69013<====>Politics of Bolivia The politics of Bolivia takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the president is head of state, head of government and head of a diverse multi-party system.  Executive power is exercised by the government.  Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of parliament.  Both the Judiciary and the electoral branch are independent of the executive and the legislature.  After the 2014 election, 53. 1% of the seats in national parliament were held by women, a higher proportion of women than that of the population. 

Economy of Bolivia<====>69014<====>Economy of Bolivia  The economy of Bolivia is the 95th largest economy in the world in nominal terms and the 87th economy in terms of purchasing power parity.  It is classified by the World Bank to be a lower middle income country.With a Human Development Index of 0. 675, it is ranked 119th (medium human development).    The Bolivian economy has had a historic pattern of a single-commodity focus.  From silver to tin to coca, Bolivia has enjoyed only occasional periods of economic diversification.  Political instability and difficult topography have constrained efforts to modernize the agricultural sector.

Radio and television Radio broadcast stations: AM 171, FM 73, shortwave 77 (1999).  Television broadcast stations: 48 (1997).   Bolivia has a large number of radio and TV stations broadcasting with private media outlets dominating.    There has been a recent, rapid growth of state-owned media, including a network of community radios.   State-owned and private radio and TV stations generally operate freely, although both pro-government and anti-government groups have attacked media outlets in response to their reporting (2010).

Foreign relations of Bolivia<====>69018<====>Foreign relations of Bolivia Bolivia traditionally has maintained normal diplomatic relations with all hemispheric states except Chile.  Foreign relations are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, headed by the Chancellor of Bolivia, since January 2017 Fernando Huanacuni, successor of David Choquehuanca Céspedes. OverviewRelations with Chile, strained since Bolivia's defeat in the War of the Pacific (1879–83) and its loss of the coastal province of Atacama, were severed from 1962 to 1975 in a dispute over the use of the waters of the Lauca River.  Relations were resumed in 1975 but broken again in 1978 over the inability of the two countries to reach an agreement that solved the Atacama border dispute, that might have granted Bolivia a sovereign access to the sea. 

Boniface, Count of Savoy<====>69019<====>Boniface, Count of Savoy Boniface (1245–1263) was Count of Savoy from 1253 to 1263, succeeding his father Amadeus IV.  He never married and thus left no heir.   CareerBoniface was born in Chambéry.   Since he became Count of Savoy at the age of nine, he required a regency.  Throughout the decade before his death, Savoy was governed through a joint regency resembling that devised for his grandfather Tomasso I in 1189, in which authority was shared between his mother, Cécile of Baux, and one of his uncles, Thomas II of Piedmont.    Boniface's other uncles, Peter II and Philip I disputed this, seeking to divide the County's many properties, but Thomas took it to arbitration per the family treaty of 1234 which had been negotiated by his brother William and won out. 

Kálmán Kalocsay<====>69022<====>Kálmán Kalocsay  Kálmán Kalocsay ( ; 6 October 1891 in Abaújszántó – 27 February 1976) was a Hungarian Esperantist poet, translator and editor who considerably influenced Esperanto culture, both in its literature and in the language itself, through his original poetry and his translations of literary works from his native Hungarian and other languages of Europe.

Moskvitch<====>69152<====>Moskvitch   Moskvitch ( ) (also written as Moskvich, Moskvič or Moskwitsch) was a Soviet/Russian automobile brand produced by AZLK from 1946 to 1991 and by OAO Moskvitch from 1991 to 2001.  The current article incorporates information about both the brand and the joint-stock successor of AZLK for the sake of simplicity. OAO Moskvitch was a privatized venture name given to the former factory in order to avoid legal issues after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.  Since the factory had no assembly branches outside Russia after 1991, its name is largely used today to refer to the building located in the lower eastern part of Moscow and abandoned since 2006. 

Teil tree<====>69154<====>Teil treeThe Oxford English Dictionary gives the etymology of teil as Latin tilia and Old French (13th to 15th centuries) til.  In Modern French it is tilleul.  The French and Latin word cognates appeared amongst the English literate classes starting in the 14th century.  Most names of trees, however, kept their Germanic origins, hence linden and lime (a deformation of lind according to the OED).  The linden or til tree is native to northern Europe and Asia.  In various versions of Protestant Bibles the til is sometimes confused with the terebinth, which is a tree native to southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.

Tartessos<====>69174<====>Tartessos Tartessos ( ) or Tartessus was a semi-mythical harbor city and the surrounding culture on the south coast of the Iberian Peninsula (in modern Andalusia, Spain), at the mouth of the Guadalquivir River.  It appears in sources from Greece and the Near East starting during the first millennium BC.  Herodotus, for example, describes it as beyond the Pillars of Heracles (Strait of Gibraltar).   Roman authors tend to echo the earlier Greek sources but from around the end of the millennium there are indications that the name Tartessos had fallen out of use and the city may have been lost to flooding, though several authors attempt to identify it with cities of other names in the area.

Lemmings (video game)<====>69179<====>Lemmings (video game)    Lemmings is a puzzle-platformer video game originally developed by DMA Design and first published by Psygnosis for the Amiga in 1991 and later ported for numerous other platforms.  The game was programmed by Mike Dailly and David Jones, and was inspired by a simple animation that Dailly created while experimenting with Deluxe Paint. The objective of the game is to guide a group of anthropomorphised lemmings through a number of obstacles to a designated exit.  To save the required number of lemmings to win, one must determine how to assign a limited number of eight different skills to specific lemmings that allow the selected lemming to alter the landscape, to affect the behaviour of other lemmings, or to clear obstacles to create a safe passage for the rest of the lemmings. 

Sycamine<====>69181<====>Sycamine The sycamine tree ( , sykaminō) is mentioned only in Luke 17:6 of the Bible. It is rendered by Luther as "mulberry tree", which is most probably the correct rendering. It is found in two species, the black mulberry (Morus nigra) and the white mulberry (Morus alba), which are common in Palestine.  It is in the same family as the fig-tree. Some contend, however, that this name denotes the sycamore fig (συκομορέαν, sykomorean) of Luke 19:4.References    

Suph<====>69182<====>SuphSuph is a place name that appears in Deuteronomy 1:1 (R. V.  marg.  "some ancient versions have the Red Sea," as in the A. V. ). Some scholars (Patrick, Rosenmüller, and others)   identify it with Suphah (Numbers 21:14, quoting the lost Book of the Wars of the Lord) as probably the name of a place.  Others identify it with es-Sufah i. e.  Maaleh-acrabbim (Joshua 15:3), and yet others with Zuph (1 Samuel 9:5).  It is most probable, however, that, in accordance with the ancient versions, this word is to be regarded as simply an abbreviation of Yam Suph i. 

Acetophenone<====>69185<====>Acetophenone Acetophenone is the organic compound with the formula C 6 H 5 C(O)CH 3  (also represented by the pseudoelement symbols PhAc or BzMe).  It is the simplest aromatic ketone.  This colorless, viscous liquid is a precursor to useful resins and fragrances.    ProductionAcetophenone is recovered as a by-product of the oxidation of ethylbenzene to ethylbenzene hydroperoxide.   Ethylbenzene hydroperoxide is an intermediate in the commercial production of propylene oxide via the propylene oxide - styrene co-product process.    Ethylbenzene hydroperoxide is primarily converted to 1-phenylethanol (α-methylbenzyl alcohol) in the process with a small amount of by-product acetophenone. 

Warren Commission<====>69186<====>Warren Commission The President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, known unofficially as the Warren Commission, was established by President Lyndon B.  Johnson through   on November 29, 1963  to investigate the assassination of United States President John F.  Kennedy that had taken place on November 22, 1963.   The U. S.  Congress passed Senate Joint Resolution 137 authorizing the Presidential appointed Commission to report on the assassination of President John F.  Kennedy, mandating the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence.   Its 888-page final report was presented to President Johnson on September 24, 1964  and made public three days later. 

547 BC<====>69187<====>547 BC  The year 547 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.  In the Roman Empire, it was known as year 207 Ab urbe condita.  The denomination 547 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

The Battles of Thymbra and Pteria are fought between Croesus of Lydia and Cyrus the Great. Cyrus besieges and captures Sardis. 

Boxing ring<====>69190<====>Boxing ringA boxing ring is the space in which a boxing match occurs.  A modern ring, which is set on a raised platform, is square with a post at each corner to which four parallel rows of ropes are attached with a turnbuckle.  Unlike its cousin the wrestling ring, the ropes in a boxing ring are generally connected together between the posts. ConstructionAs there are a number of professional boxing organizations, the standards of construction vary.  A standard ring is between   to a side between the ropes with another   outside.  The platform of the ring is generally   from the ground and is covered by about   of padding topped by stretched canvas. 

Labiodental consonant<====>69192<====>Labiodental consonant  In phonetics, labiodentals are consonants articulated with the lower lip and the upper teeth.Labiodental consonant in IPAThe labiodental consonants identified by the International Phonetic Alphabet are:IPA Description Example Language Orthography IPA Meaning   voiceless labiodental stop Greek σάπφειρος   'sapphire'   voiced labiodental stop Sikavoiceless labiodental affricate Tsonga timpfuvu   'hippos'   voiced labiodental affricate Tsonga shilebvu   'chin'   labiodental nasal English symphony voiceless labiodental fricative English fan voiced labiodental fricative English van labiodental approximant Dutch wang   'cheek'   labiodental flap Mono vwa   'send'   labiodental click Nǁng ʘoe   'meat' The IPA chart shades out labiodental lateral consonants. This is sometimes read as indicating that such sounds are not possible. In fact, the fricatives   and   often have lateral airflow, but no language makes a distinction for centrality, and the allophony is not noticeable.The IPA symbol   refers to a sound occurring in Swedish, officially described as similar to the velar fricative [x], but one dialectal variant is a rounded, velarized labiodental, less ambiguously rendered as  . The labiodental click is an allophonic variant of the (bi)labial click.OccurrenceThe only common labiodental sounds to occur phonemically are the fricatives and the approximant. The labiodental flap occurs phonemically in over a dozen languages, but it is restricted geographically to central and southeastern Africa (Olson & Hajek 2003). With most other manners of articulation, the norm are bilabial consonants (which together with labiodentals, form the class of labial consonants).  is quite common, but in all or nearly all languages in which it occurs, it occurs only as an allophone of   before labiodental consonants such as   and  . It has been reported to occur phonemically in a dialect of Teke, but similar claims in the past have proven spurious.The XiNkuna dialect of Tsonga features a pair of affricates as phonemes. In some other languages, such as Xhosa, affricates may occur as allophones of the fricatives. These differ from the German bilabial-labiodental affricate  , which commences with a bilabial p. All these affricates are rare sounds.The stops are not confirmed to exist as separate phonemes in any language. They are sometimes written as ȹ ȸ (qp and db ligatures). They may also be found in children's speech or as speech impediments .  consonantsDentolabial consonants are the articulatory opposite of labiodentals: They are pronounced by contacting lower teeth against the upper lip. They are rare cross-linguistically, likely due to the prevalence of dental malocclusions (especially retrognathism) that make them difficult to produce,  though one allophone of Swedish   has been described as a velarized dentolabial fricative,  and the voiceless dentolabial fricative is apparently used in some of the southwestern dialects of Greenlandic (Vebæk 2006).The diacritic for dentolabial in the extensions of the IPA for disordered speech is a superscript bridge,  , by analogy with the subscript bridge used for labiodentals:  . Complex consonants such as affricates, prenasalized stops and the like are also possible.See alsoPlace of articulationList of phonetics topicsReferences Olson, Kenneth S. & John Hajek. 2003.

Dental consonant<====>69193<====>Dental consonant  A dental consonant is a consonant articulated with the tongue against the upper teeth, such as  ,  ,  , and   in some languages.  Dentals are usually distinguished from sounds in which contact is made with the tongue and the gum ridge, as in English (see alveolar consonant) because of the acoustic similarity of the sounds and the fact that in the Roman alphabet, they are generally written using the same symbols (like t, d, n). In the International Phonetic Alphabet, the diacritic for dental consonant is  . Cross-linguisticallyFor many languages, such as Albanian, Irish and Russian, velarization is generally associated with more dental articulations of coronal consonants. 

Cenovis<====>69197<====>Cenovis Cenovis is a product based on yeast extract that is similar to Marmite and Vegemite, rich in vitamin B 1 .  In the form of a dark brown food paste, it is used to flavour soups, sausages and salads.  The most popular way to consume Cenovis, however, is to spread it on a slice of buttered bread, as stated on the product's packaging. Cenovis is popular in Switzerland (particularly Romandy).   It was developed in Rheinfelden in 1931, on the initiative of a master brewer called Alex Villinger,  and was subsequently produced  by the company Cenovis SA.

Semivowel<====>69209<====>Semivowel In phonetics and phonology, a semivowel or glide, also known as a non-syllabic vocoid, is a sound that is phonetically similar to a vowel sound but functions as the syllable boundary, rather than as the nucleus of a syllable.   Examples of semivowels in English are the consonants y and w, in yes and west.  Written   in IPA, y and w are near to the vowels ee and oo in seen and moon, written   in IPA. ClassificationSemivowels form a subclass of approximants.   Although "semivowel" and "approximant" are sometimes treated as synonymous,  most authors agree that not all approximants are semivowels although the exact details may vary from author to author.

Angioplasty<====>69279<====>Angioplasty  Angioplasty, also known as balloon angioplasty and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), is a minimally invasive, endovascular procedure to widen narrowed or obstructed arteries or veins, typically to treat arterial atherosclerosis.  A deflated balloon attached to a catheter (a balloon catheter) is passed over a guide-wire into the narrowed vessel and then inflated to a fixed size.  The balloon forces expansion of the blood vessel and the surrounding muscular wall, allowing an improved blood flow.  A stent may be inserted at the time of ballooning to ensure the vessel remains open, and the balloon is then deflated and withdrawn. 

Sergius Paulus<====>69284<====>Sergius PaulusLucius Sergius Paulus or Paullus was a Proconsul of Cyprus under Claudius (1st century AD).  He appears in Acts 13:6-12, where in Paphos Paul, accompanied by Barnabas and John Mark, overcame the attempts of Bar-Jesus (Elymas) "to turn the proconsul away from the faith" and converted Sergius to Christianity. A boundary stone of Claudius mentioning Sergius was discovered at Rome in 1887.   It records the appointment (AD 47) of the Curators of the banks and the channel of the river Tiber, one of whom was Sergius.  Since Paul's journey to Cyprus is usually dated to the first half of the 40s (and some scholars date his visit even earlier), it is thought Sergius may have first served three years as Proconsul at Cyprus, then returned to Rome, where he was appointed curator.

Rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel<====>69295<====>Rock-cut tombs in ancient IsraelHundreds of rock-cut tombs were constructed in Israel in ancient times.  They were cut into the rock, sometimes with elaborate facades and multiple burial chambers.  Some are free-standing, but most are caves.  Each tomb typically belonged to a single, wealthy family.

Rechabite<====>69374<====>Rechabite Rechabites   are a biblical clan, the descendants of Rechab through Jehonadab.  They belonged to the Kenites, who accompanied the Israelites into the Holy Land and dwelt among them.  The main body of the Kenites dwelt in cities and adopted settled habits of life  but Jehonadab forbade his descendants to drink wine or to live in cities.   They were commanded to always lead a nomadic life. The Rechabites adhered to the law laid down by Jonadab, and were noted for their fidelity to the old-established custom of their family in the days of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 35); and this feature of their character is referred to by God for the purpose of giving point to his message to the King of Judah.

Ranges<====>69378<====>Ranges In the Hebrew Bible and in the Old Testament, the word ranges has two very different meanings. LeviticusIn Leviticus 11:35, ranges probably means a cooking furnace for two or more pots, as the Hebrew word here is in the dual number; or perhaps a fireplace fitted to receive a pair of ovens. 2 KingsIn 2 Kings 11:8, the Hebrew word is here used different from the preceding, meaning "ranks of soldiers. " The Levites were appointed to guard the king's person within the temple (2 Chronicles 23:7), while the soldiers were his guard in the court, and in going from the temple to the palace. 

Ramoth-Gilead<====>69382<====>Ramoth-GileadRamoth-Gilead ( , meaning "Heights of Gilead"), was a Levitical city and city of refuge east of the Jordan river in the Hebrew Bible, also called "Ramoth in Gilead" (Deuteronomy  ; Joshua  ;  ) or "Ramoth Galaad" in the Douay-Rheims Bible.  It was located in the tribal territorial allotment of the tribe of Gad. Biblical eventsAccording to 1 Kings  , Ramoth-Gilead was the base of Ben-Geber, one of King Solomon's regional governors.

Burgh Island<====>69383<====>Burgh Island  Burgh Island is a small tidal island on the coast of South Devon in England near the small seaside village of Bigbury-on-Sea.  There are several buildings on the island, the largest being the Art Deco Burgh Island Hotel.  The other buildings are three private houses, and a public house, the Pilchard Inn, run by the hotel. HistoryArchaeological discovery of tin ingots at the River Erme estuary wreck  such that the local area was a significant tin trading port in ancient times ; it is unclear whether the ingots date from the Iron Age or Sub-Roman periods, however this discovery so close to Burgh Island has drawn comparisons with Diodorus Siculus 1C BCE text, more often associated with St Michaels Mount in Cornwall: The island has been known by various names over the years. 

Rahab<====>69385<====>Rahab Rahab, ( ;   ) was, according to the Book of Joshua, a prostitute who lived in Jericho in the Promised Land and assisted the Israelites in capturing the city.  In the New Testament she was lauded as an example of living by faith, The Epistle to the Hebrews, 11:31  while being considered righteous by her works.  The Book of James, 2:25 Although Matthew 1:5 in the King James Translation uses the name Rachab, Biblical literature commonly refer to Rachab and Rahab as two names of the same person such as the Strong's Concordance of the Bible and the Young's Analytical Concordance to the Bible. 

Groote Eylandt<====>69386<====>Groote Eylandt Groote Eylandt is the largest island in the Gulf of Carpentaria and the fourth largest island in Australia.

Rabshakeh<====>69387<====>RabshakehRabshakeh, also Rab-shakeh and Rabsaces, (Akkadian language Rabshaqe;  ;   Rapsakēs;  ;  ) is a title meaning "chief of the princes" in the Semitic Akkadian and Aramaic languages.  The title was given to the chief cup-bearer or the vizier of the Akkadian, Assyrian and Babylonian royal courts in ancient Mesopotamia,  and revived by the Assyrians as a military rank during World War I.  The Hebrew Bible mentions it for one of Sennacherib's messengers to Hezekiah, who were sent to Jerusalem along with the Tartan and the Rabsaris.   The speech he delivered, in the Hebrew language, in the hearing of all the people, as he stood near the wall on the north side of the city, is quoted in 2 Kings 18:27–37 and Isaiah 36:12–20: He and the other envoys returned to their master and reported that Hezekiah and his people were obdurate, and would not submit.

Like the nearby rocky islets of Chicken Rock and Kitterland, it is part of the parish of Rushen.  It has only two seasonal inhabitants.  The word 'calf' derives from the Old Norse word kalfr which means a small island lying near a larger one.  It is possible to reach the Calf of Man by boat from both Port Erin and Port St Mary. 

Quarries (biblical)<====>69395<====>Quarries (biblical)Quarries - (1. ) The "Royal Quarries" (see Zedekiah's Cave)  — not found in Scripture — is the namegiven to the vast caverns stretching far underneath the northern hill, Bezetha, on which Jerusalem is built.  Out of these mammoth caverns stones, a hard limestone, were quarried in the past for buildings in the city, and for the temples of Solomon, Zerubbabel, and Herod.  Huge blocks of stone are still found in these caves bearing the marks of pick and chisel.  The general appearance of the whole suggests the idea that the Phoenician quarrymen have just suspended their work. 

Delta Works<====>69398<====>Delta Works    The Delta Works ( ) is a series of construction projects in the southwest of the Netherlands to protect a large area of land around the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta from the sea.

List of botanical gardens<====>69412<====>List of botanical gardensA botanical garden is a place where plants, especially ferns, conifers and flowering plants, are grown and displayed for the purposes of research, conservation, and education.  This distinguishes them from parks and pleasure gardens where plants, usually with showy flowers, are grown for public amenity only.  Botanical gardens that specialize in trees are sometimes referred to as arboretums.   They are occasionally associated with zoos. The earliest botanical gardens were founded in the late Renaissance at the University of Pisa (1543) and the University of Padua (1545) in Italy, for the study and teaching of medical botany. 

Eastern Scheldt<====>69413<====>Eastern Scheldt  The Eastern Scheldt ( ) is a former estuary in the province of Zeeland, Netherlands, between Schouwen-Duiveland and Tholen on the north and Noord-Beveland and Zuid-Beveland on the south.  It is also the largest national park in the Netherlands, founded in 2002. Landscape and historyDuring the Roman Era it was the major mouth of the Scheldt River.  Before the St.  Felix's Flood of 1530, it flowed north as a river from the east end of the Westerschelde, turned west a little west of Bergen op Zoom, and then west along the north edge of what is now the Verdronken Land van Reimerswaal, and after that widened into an estuary. 

Castration<====>69414<====>Castration  Castration (also known as gonadectomy) is any action, surgical, chemical, or otherwise, by which an individual loses use of the testicles.  Surgical castration is bilateral orchiectomy (excision of both testes), and chemical castration uses pharmaceutical drugs to deactivate the testes.  Castration causes sterilization (preventing them from reproducing); it also greatly reduces the production of certain hormones, such as testosterone.  Surgical castration in animals is often called neutering. The term "castration" is sometimes also used to refer to the removal of the ovaries in the female, otherwise known as an oophorectomy or, in animals, spaying.  Estrogen levels drop precipitously following oophorectomy, and long-term effects of the reduction of sex hormones are significant throughout the body. 

Economic growth<====>69415<====>Economic growthEconomic growth is the increase in the inflation-adjusted market value of the goods and services produced by an economy over time.  It is conventionally measured as the percent rate of increase in real gross domestic product, or real GDP.  Overview   Growth is usually calculated in real terms - i. e. , inflation-adjusted terms – to eliminate the distorting effect of inflation on the price of goods produced.  Measurement of economic growth uses national income accounting.Since economic growth is measured as the annual percent change of gross domestic product (GDP), it has all the advantages and drawbacks of that measure. 

Tiberius Gracchus<====>69418<====>Tiberius Gracchus   Tiberius Gracchus (Latin:  TI·SEMPRONIVS·TI·F·P·N·GRACCVS ; born c.  169–164 – 133 BC)    Life of Caius Gracchus by Plutarch: Plutarch says Tiberius "was not yet thirty when he was slain. "  was a Roman populist and reformist politician of the 2nd century BC.  He was a son of Tiberius Gracchus the Elder and Cornelia Africana.  As a plebeian tribune, Tiberius Gracchus caused political turmoil in the Republic with his reforms of agrarian legislation that sought to transfer land from wealthy, predominantly patrician landowners to poorer citizens.  He was murdered, along with many of his supporters, by members of the Roman Senate and supporters of the conservative Optimate faction. 

Botanical garden<====>69427<====>Botanical garden  A botanical garden or botanic garden The terms botanic and botanical and garden or gardens are used more-or-less interchangeably, although the word botanic is generally reserved for the earlier, more traditional gardens.   is a garden dedicated to the collection, cultivation and display of a wide range of plants labelled with their botanical names.  It may contain specialist plant collections such as cacti and other succulent plants, herb gardens, plants from particular parts of the world, and so on; there may be greenhouses, shadehouses, again with special collections such as tropical plants, alpine plants, or other exotic plants. 

Johnny Hodges<====>69430<====>Johnny Hodges John Cornelius Hodges (July 25, 1907 – May 11, 1970) was an American alto saxophonist, best known for solo work with Duke Ellington's big band.  He played lead alto in the saxophone section for many years, except the period between 1932 and 1946 when Otto Hardwick generally played first chair.  Hodges was also featured on soprano saxophone, but refused to play soprano after 1946, when he was given the lead chair.   He is considered one of the definitive alto saxophone players of the big band era (alongside Benny Carter).    Hodges started playing with Lloyd Scott, Sidney Bechet, Luckey Roberts and Chick Webb. 

Southeastern League<====>69435<====>Southeastern League The Southeastern League was the name of three baseball circuits in minor league baseball which operated in the Southeastern and South Central United States.   Two of these leagues were associated with organized baseball; the third and most recent incarnation was an independent league that operated for two seasons in 2002–03. HistoryClass D league (1910–12)The first Southeastern League lasted for three years, from   through  .  At Class D, it was considered on the lowest rung of the minor league ladder, and had six clubs located in the American states of Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee. 

Crewe Alexandra F.C.<====>69438<====>Crewe Alexandra F. C.Crewe Alexandra Football Club is a professional association football club based in the town of Crewe, Cheshire, England.

Scatman Crothers<====>69439<====>Scatman Crothers   Benjamin Sherman Crothers (January 23, 1910 – November 22, 1986),    known as Scatman Crothers, was an American actor, singer, dancer and musician known for his work as Louie the Garbage Man on the TV show Chico and the Man and as Dick Hallorann in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining (1980), the latter of which earned him the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor. He was also a prolific voiceover artist, and provided the voices of Meadowlark Lemon in the Harlem Globetrotters' animated TV series, Jazz the Autobot in The Transformers and The Transformers: The Movie (1986), the title character in Hong Kong Phooey and Scat Cat in the animated Disney film The Aristocats (1970). 

Edge effects<====>69440<====>Edge effects In ecology, edge effects are changes in population or community structures that occur at the boundary of five or more habitats.   Areas with small habitat fragments exhibit especially pronounced edge effects that may extend throughout the range.  As the edge effects increase, the boundary habitat allows for greater biodiversity. TypesInherent – Natural features stabilize the border location. Induced – Transient natural disturbances (e. g. , fire or flood) or human related activities, subject borders to successional changes over time. Narrow – One habitat abruptly ends and another begins (e. g. , an agricultural field. )Wide (ecotone) – A large distance separates the borders of two clearly and purely definable habitats based upon their physical conditions and vegetation, and in between there exists a large transition region. 

Waterfall<====>69442<====>Waterfall  A waterfall is a place where water flows over a vertical drop or a series of steep drops in the course of a stream or river.  Waterfalls also occur where meltwater drops over the edge of a tabular iceberg or ice shelf. FormationWaterfalls are commonly formed in the upper course of a river in steep mountains.Because of their landscape position, many waterfalls occur over bedrock fed by little contributing area, so may be ephemeral and flow only during rainstorms or significant snowmelt.  The further downstream, the more perennial a waterfall can be. 

Mutiny<====>69443<====>Mutiny Mutiny is a criminal conspiracy among a group of people (typically members of the military or the crew of any ship, even if they are civilians) to openly oppose, change, or overthrow a lawful authority to which they are subject.  The term is commonly used for a rebellion among members of the military against their superior officers, but it can also occasionally refer to any type of rebellion against an authority figure. During the Age of Discovery, mutiny particularly meant open rebellion against a ship's captain.  This occurred, for example, during Ferdinand Magellan's journeys around the world resulting in the killing of one mutineer, the execution of another, and the marooning of others; on Henry Hudson's Discovery resulting in Hudson and others being set adrift in a boat; and the notorious mutiny on the Bounty. 

Jules Maigret<====>69445<====>Jules Maigret  , simply   or   to most people, is a fictional French police detective, actually a   or commissioner of the Paris   ( ), created by writer  . Seventy-six novels and twenty-eight short stories about Maigret were published between 1931 and 1972, starting with   (Peter the Lett) and concluding with   (Maigret and Monsieur Charles).  The Maigret stories were also adapted for television and radio. An ambitious project by Penguin Books will see the publication of new translations of 75 books in  ’s Maigret series over as many months beginning in November 2013, by translators David Bellos, Anthea Bell, and Ros Schwartz. 

Mucous membrane<====>69447<====>Mucous membrane  A mucous membrane or mucosa is a membrane that lines various cavities in the body and covers the surface of internal organs.  It consists of one or more layers of epithelial cells overlying a layer of loose connective tissue.  It is mostly of endodermal origin and is continuous with the skin at various body openings such as the eyes, ears, inside the nose, inside the mouth, lip, the urethral opening and the anus.  Some mucous membranes secrete mucus, a thick protective fluid.  The function of the membrane is to stop pathogens and dirt from entering the body and to prevent bodily tissues from becoming dehydrated. 

University of Brighton<====>69451<====>University of BrightonThe University of Brighton is a public university based on five campuses in Brighton, Eastbourne and Hastings on the south coast of England.  Its roots can be traced back to 1858 when the Brighton School of Art was opened in the Royal Pavilion and it achieved university status in 1992. The university focuses on professional education, with the majority of degrees awarded also recognised by professional organisations or leading to professional qualifications.  Subjects include pharmacy, engineering, ecology, computing, mathematics, architecture, geology, nursing, teaching, sport science, journalism, criminology and business.

AdministrationThe Leader of the Council and Labour minority administration since May 2015 is Councillor Warren Morgan (Lab Co-op). The mayor of Brighton and Hove for 2017-2018 is Councillor Mo Marsh.  Geoff Raw is the current chief executive. DVLA database banIn 2012 it was revealed that the Brighton and Hove unitary authority has been permanently banned from accessing information from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. This information is normally made available to local authorities for purposes such as enforcing parking fines, but access can be withdrawn if they are found to be misusing the service. The Big Brother Watch organisation, which obtained the information about the ban under a Freedom of Information request, claimed that "the public are right to be worried that their privacy is at risk across a range of government services."

The country is less than 48 km wide at its greatest width.  The country's present boundaries were defined in 1889 after an agreement between the United Kingdom and France.  It is often claimed by Gambians that the distance of the borders from the Gambia River corresponds to the area that British naval cannon of the time could reach from the river's channel.  However, there is no historical evidence to support the story, and the border was actually delineated using careful surveying methods by the Franco-British boundary commission.

The more widespread was a set of computer communication packet-based protocols intended to connect the then-recently developed and very popular (within MIT) Lisp machines; the second was one of the earliest local area network (LAN) hardware implementations. OriginThe Chaosnet protocol originally used an implementation over CATV coaxial cable modeled on the early Xerox PARC   Ethernet,  the early ARPANET, and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).  It was a contention-based system intended to work over a   range,  that included a pseudo-slotted feature intended to reduce collisions, which worked by passing a virtual token of permission from host to host; successful packet transmissions updated each host's knowledge of which host had the token at that time.

Terminate and stay resident program<====>69741<====>Terminate and stay resident program Regarding computers, a terminate and stay resident program (commonly referred to by the initialism TSR) is a computer program that uses a system call in DOS operating systems to return control of the computer to the operating system, as though the program has quit, but stays resident in computer memory so it can be reactivated by a hardware or software interrupt.   This technique partially overcame DOS operating systems' limitation of executing only one program, or task, at a time.  TSR is unique to DOS and not used in Windows. Some terminate and stay resident programs were utility programs that a computer user might call up several times a day, while working in another program, using a hotkey.

William Friese-Greene<====>69838<====>William Friese-Greene   William Friese-Greene (born William Edward Green, 7 September 1855 – 5 May 1921) was a prolific English inventor and professional photographer.  He is principally known as a pioneer in the field of motion pictures, creating a series of cameras in the period 1888–91 with which he shot moving pictures in London.  He went on to patent an early two-colour filming process in 1905.  His inventions in the field of printing – including photo-typesetting and a method of printing without ink – brought him wealth, as did his chain of photographic studios.  However, he spent everything he earned on inventing, going bankrupt three times and to jail once, before dying in poverty.

Science museum<====>69870<====>Science museum  A science museum is a museum devoted primarily to science.  Older science museums tended to concentrate on static displays of objects related to natural history, paleontology, geology, industry and industrial machinery, etc.  Modern trends in museology have broadened the range of subject matter and introduced many interactive exhibits.   Many if not most modern science museums — which increasingly refer to themselves as science centers or "discovery centers" — also emphasize technology, and are therefore also technology museums. The mission statements of science centers and modern museums vary, but they are united in being places that make science accessible and encourage the excitement of discovery.

Interpolation search<====>69895<====>Interpolation search Interpolation search is an algorithm for searching for a given key in an indexed array that has been ordered by numerical values assigned to the keys (key values).  It parallels how humans search through a telephone book for a particular name, the key value by which the book's entries are ordered.  In each search step it calculates where in the remaining search space the sought item might be, based on the key values at the bounds of the search space and the value of the sought key, usually via a linear interpolation.  The key value actually found at this estimated position is then compared to the key value being sought.

Nuclear pulse propulsion<====>69937<====>Nuclear pulse propulsion Nuclear pulse propulsion or external pulsed plasma propulsion, is a hypothetical method of spacecraft propulsion that uses nuclear explosions for thrust.   It was first developed as Project Orion by DARPA, after a suggestion by Stanislaw Ulam in 1947.   Newer designs using inertial confinement fusion have been the baseline for most post-Orion designs, including Project Daedalus and Project Longshot. Project Orion Project Orion was the first serious attempt to design a nuclear pulse rocket.  The design effort was carried out at General Atomics in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  The idea of Orion was to react small directional nuclear explosives utilizing a variant of the Teller-Ulam two-stage bomb design against a large steel pusher plate attached to the spacecraft with shock absorbers. 

Elliptic function<====>69939<====>Elliptic functionIn complex analysis, an elliptic function is a meromorphic function that is periodic in two directions.  Just as a periodic function of a real variable is defined by its values on an interval, an elliptic function is determined by its values on a fundamental parallelogram, which then repeat in a lattice.  Such a doubly periodic function cannot be holomorphic, as it would then be a bounded entire function, and by Liouville's theorem every such function must be constant.  In fact, an elliptic function must have at least two poles (counting multiplicity) in a fundamental parallelogram, as it is easy to show using the periodicity that a contour integral around its boundary must vanish, implying that the residues of all simple poles must cancel.

Hypergolic propellant<====>69957<====>Hypergolic propellantA hypergolic propellant combination used in a rocket engine is one whose components spontaneously ignite when they come into contact with each other. The two propellant components usually consist of a fuel and an oxidizer.  Although commonly used hypergolic propellants are difficult to handle because of their extreme toxicity and/or corrosiveness, they can be stored as liquids at room temperature and hypergolic engines are easy to ignite reliably and repeatedly. In contemporary usage, the terms "hypergol" or "hypergolic propellant" usually mean the most common such propellant combination, dinitrogen tetroxide plus hydrazine and/or its relatives monomethylhydrazine and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine. 

Hornbill<====>69971<====>Hornbill  The hornbills (Bucerotidae) are a family of bird found in tropical and subtropical Africa, Asia and Melanesia.  They are characterized by a long, down-curved bill which is frequently brightly colored and sometimes has a casque on the upper mandible.  Both the common English and the scientific name of the family refer to the shape of the bill, "buceros" being "cow horn" in Greek.  Hornbills have a two-lobed kidney.  They are the only birds in which the first and second neck vertebrae (the atlas and axis respectively) are fused together; this probably provides a more stable platform for carrying the bill.

Maine Coon<====>70024<====>Maine Coon {{Infobox cat breed  }}The Maine Coon is one of the largest domesticated breeds of cat.  It has a distinctive physical appearance and valuable hunting skills.  It is one of the oldest natural breeds in North America, specifically "native" to the state of Maine (though the feline was simply introduced there),    where it is the official state cat. No records of the Maine Coon's exact origins and date of introduction to the United States exist, so several competing hypotheses have been suggested.  The breed was popular in cat shows in the late 19th century, but its existence became threatened when long-haired breeds from overseas were introduced in the early 20th century.

Recursive descent parser<====>70089<====>Recursive descent parser In computer science, a recursive descent parser is a kind of top-down parser built from a set of mutually recursive procedures (or a non-recursive equivalent) where each such procedure usually implements one of the productions of the grammar.  Thus the structure of the resulting program closely mirrors that of the grammar it recognizes.  A predictive parser is a recursive descent parser that does not require backtracking.   Predictive parsing is possible only for the class of LL(k) grammars, which are the context-free grammars for which there exists some positive integer k that allows a recursive descent parser to decide which production to use by examining only the next k tokens of input.

The input may be a text file containing the grammar written in BNF or EBNF that defines the syntax of a programming language, and whose generated output is some source code of the parser for the programming language, although other definitions exist.  "A SYNTAX DIRECTED COMPILER FOR ALGOL 60" Edgar T.  Irons, Communications of the ACM Volume 4 Issue 1, Jan.  1961. " Usually, the resulting source code will have to be extended upon before a complete compiler emerges.

Founded to advance rifle marksmanship, the modern NRA continues to teach firearm competency and safety.  It instructs civilians and law enforcement, youths and adults, in various programs. 

Simple LR parser<====>70104<====>Simple LR parser In computer science, a Simple LR or SLR parser is a type of LR parser with small parse tables and a relatively simple parser generator algorithm.   As with other types of LR(1) parser, an SLR parser is quite efficient at finding the single correct bottom-up parse in a single left-to-right scan over the input stream, without guesswork or backtracking.   The parser is mechanically generated from a formal grammar for the language. SLR and the more-general methods LALR parser and Canonical LR parser have identical methods and similar tables at parse time; they differ only in the mathematical grammar analysis algorithms used by the parser generator tool.

A separate species, Viscum cruciatum, occurs in Southwest Spain and Southern Portugal, as well as North Africa, Australia and Asia. 

Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution<====>70131<====>Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution The Twenty-first Amendment (Amendment XXI) to the United States Constitution repealed the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which had mandated nationwide Prohibition on alcohol on January 16, 1919.  The Twenty-first Amendment was ratified on December 5, 1933 .  It is unique among the 27 amendments of the U. S.  Constitution for being the only one to repeal a prior amendment and to have been ratified by state ratifying conventions. Text Background The Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution had ushered in a period known as Prohibition, during which the manufacture, distribution, and sale of alcoholic beverages was illegal. 

Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution<====>70132<====>Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution   The Twenty-second Amendment (Amendment XXII) of the United States Constitution limits the number of times one can be elected to the office of President of the United States.  Congress proposed the amendment by two-thirds of both the House and Senate on March 21, 1947.  Ratification by the requisite 36 of the then-48 states was completed on February 27, 1951. Text HistoryAlthough the Twenty-second Amendment was clearly a reaction to Franklin D.  Roosevelt's service as President for an unprecedented four terms, the notion of presidential term limits has long-standing roots in American politics. 

Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution<====>70133<====>Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution The Twenty-third Amendment (Amendment XXIII) to the United States Constitution extends the right to vote in the presidential election to citizens residing in the District of Columbia by granting the District electors in the Electoral College, as if it were a state.

Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution<====>70134<====>Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution  The Twenty-fourth Amendment (Amendment XXIV) of the United States Constitution prohibits both Congress and the states from conditioning the right to vote in federal elections on payment of a poll tax or other types of tax.  The amendment was proposed by Congress to the states on August 27, 1962, and was ratified by the states on January 23, 1964. Southern states of the former Confederate States of America adopted poll taxes in laws of the late 19th century and new constitutions from 1890 to 1908, after the Democratic Party had generally regained control of state legislatures decades after the end of Reconstruction, as a measure to prevent African Americans and often poor whites from voting. 

Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution<====>70135<====>Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution  The Twenty-fifth Amendment (Amendment XXV) to the United States Constitution deals with succession to the Presidency and establishes procedures both for filling a vacancy in the office of the Vice President as well as responding to Presidential disabilities.

The drive to lower the voting age from 21 to 18 grew across the country during the 1960s, driven in large part by the broader student activism movement protesting the Vietnam War.  The impetus for drafting an amendment to lower the voting age arose following the Supreme Court's decision in Oregon v. 

Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution<====>70138<====>Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution The Twenty-seventh Amendment (Amendment XXVII) to the United States Constitution prohibits any law that increases or decreases the salary of members of Congress from taking effect until the start of the next set of terms of office for Representatives.  It is the most recent amendment to be adopted, but one of the first proposed. It was submitted by Congress to the states for ratification on September 25, 1789, along with eleven other proposed amendments.  While ten of these twelve proposals were ratified in 1791 to become the Bill of Rights, what would become the Twenty-seventh Amendment and the proposed Congressional Apportionment Amendment did not get ratified by enough states for them to also come into force with the first ten amendments. 

Click-to-donate site<====>70140<====>Click-to-donate siteA click-to-donate site is a website where users can click a button to generate a donation for a charity or cause.  These websites are otherwise known as fundraising platforms or crowdfunding platforms.  The money for the donation comes from advertisers whose banners are displayed each time a user clicks the button.  While not directly contributing (though many sites offer additional ways of support), visitors are making a difference in the sense that, had they not visited, no donation would have been given.

Recycling<====>70157<====>Recycling    Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects.  It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions (compared to plastic production,   for example).  Recycling can prevent the waste of potentially useful materials and reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, thereby reducing: energy usage, air pollution (from incineration), and water pollution (from landfilling). Recycling is a key component of modern waste reduction and is the third component of the "Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle" waste hierarchy.  There are some ISO standards related to recycling such as ISO 15270:2008 for plastics waste and ISO 14001:2004 for environmental management control of recycling practice.

Since the 1970s, there has been a resurgence in the study of Cyrano, demonstrated in the abundance of theses, essays, articles and biographies published in France and elsewhere in recent decades. 

Linus's Law<====>70370<====>Linus's LawLinus's Law is a claim about software development, named in honor of Linus Torvalds and formulated by Eric S.  Raymond in his essay and book The Cathedral and the Bazaar (1999).    The law states that "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"; or more formally: "Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone. " Presenting the code to multiple developers with the purpose of reaching consensus about its acceptance is a simple form of software reviewing.  Researchers and practitioners have repeatedly shown  the effectiveness of various types of reviewing process in finding bugs and security issues,  and also that  .

Thinks ...<====>70375<====>Thinks . . .Thinks . . .  is a 2001 novel by British author David Lodge. Place and timeThe novel is exclusively set at the (entirely fictitious [cf.  "Author's Note"]) University of Gloucester, based loosely on the University of York thanks to the author's brief residence there.  (Its Cognitive Science and Creative Writing departments also bear uncanny resemblances to those of the universities of Sussex and East Anglia respectively. )  Its action takes place in the spring term of 1997 (during the time of Tony Blair's landslide victory). Main charactersHelen ReedHelen Reed, an English novelist in her early forties with two children old enough to look after themselves, arrives on campus to spend the term there as "writer-in-residence" and to teach a creative writing class – actually sitting in for a professor who is spending the term abroad to write a novel. 

Intel 80486DX2<====>70379<====>Intel 80486DX2 The Intel i486DX2, rumored as 80486DX2 (later renamed IntelDX2) is a CPU produced by Intel that was introduced in 1992.  The i486DX2 was nearly identical to the i486DX, but it had additional clock multiplier circuitry.  It was the first chip to use clock doubling, whereby the processor runs two internal logic clock cycles per external bus cycle.  An i486 DX2 was thus significantly faster than an i486 DX at the same bus speed thanks to the 8K on-chip cache shadowing the slower clocked external bus. For many players of video games during the early and mid 1990s, towards the end of the MS-DOS gaming era, the i486DX2-66 was a very popular processor. 

Tehran Conference<====>70381<====>Tehran Conference  The Tehran Conference (codenamed Eureka   ) was a strategy meeting of Joseph Stalin, Franklin D.  Roosevelt, and Winston Churchill from 28 November to 1 December 1943, after the Anglo-Soviet Invasion of Iran.  It was held in the Soviet Union's embassy in Tehran, Iran.  It was the first of the World War II conferences of the "Big Three" Allied leaders (the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom).  It closely followed the Cairo Conference which had taken place on 22–26 November 1943, and preceded the 1945 Yalta and Potsdam conferences. 

Blossom<====>70382<====>Blossom In botany, blossoms are the flowers of stone fruit trees (genus Prunus) and of some other plants with a similar appearance that flower profusely for a period of time in spring. Colloquially flowers of orange are referred to as such as well.  Peach blossoms (including nectarine), most cherry blossoms, and some almond blossoms are usually pink.  Plum blossoms, apple blossoms, orange blossoms, some cherry blossoms, and most almond blossoms are white.  Blossoms provide pollen to pollinators such as bees, and initiate cross-pollination necessary for the trees to reproduce by producing fruit.  Blossom trees have a tendency to lose their flower petals in wind-blown cascades, often covering the surrounding ground in petals.

Dagobert I<====>70390<====>Dagobert I  Dagobert I ( ;   603 – 19 January 639 AD) was the king of Austrasia (623–634), king of all the Franks (629–634), and king of Neustria and Burgundy (629–639).  He was the last king of the Merovingian dynasty to wield any real royal power.   Dagobert was the first of the Frankish kings to be buried in the royal tombs at Saint Denis Basilica.  Rule in AustrasiaDagobert was the eldest son of Chlothar II and Haldetrude (575–604).  Chlothar had reigned alone over all the Franks since 613.  In 623, Chlothar was forced to make Dagobert king of Austrasia by the nobility of that region, who wanted a king of their own. 

Johann Joachim Quantz<====>70391<====>Johann Joachim Quantz Johann Joachim Quantz ( ; 30 January 1697 – 12 July 1773) was a German flautist, flute maker and Baroque music composer.  He composed hundreds of flute sonatas and concertos, and wrote On Playing the Flute, a treatise on flute performance. BiographyQuantz was born as Hanß Jochim Quantz  in Oberscheden, near Göttingen, in the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg.  His father, Andreas Quantz, was a blacksmith who died when Hans was not yet 11; on his deathbed, he begged his son to follow in his footsteps.   Nevertheless, from 1708 to 1713 he began his musical studies as a child with his uncle Justus Quantz, a town musician in Merseburg; he also studied for a time with a cousin's husband, the organist Johann Friedrich Kiesewetter. 

Countertenor<====>70393<====>Countertenor A countertenor (also contra tenor) is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range is equivalent to that of the female contralto or mezzo-soprano voice types, generally extending from around G 3  to D 5  or E 5 ,  although a sopranist (a specific kind of countertenor) may match the soprano's range of around C 4  to C 6 .  A sopranist is a term used to describe a countertenor whose voice range is so high it is equivalent to that of a soprano; however, this term is widely used falsely.    Countertenors often are baritones or tenors at core, but rarely use this vocal range in performance. 

Chlothar II<====>70394<====>Chlothar II Chlothar II (or Chlotar, Clothar, Clotaire, Chlotochar, or Hlothar; 584–629), called the Great or the Young, was King of Neustria and King of the Franks, and the son of Chilperic I and his third wife, Fredegund.  He started his reign as an infant under the regency of his mother, who was in an uneasy alliance with Clothar's uncle Guntram, King of Burgundy (d.  592).   Clothar assumed full power over Neustria upon her death in 597; though rich this was one of the smallest portions of Francia.  He continued his mother's feud with Queen Brunhilda of Austrasia with equal viciousness and bloodshed, finally achieving her execution in an especially brutal manner in 613, after winning the battle that enabled Chlothar to unite Francia under his rule. 

Bounded rationality<====>70400<====>Bounded rationalityBounded rationality is the idea that when individuals make decisions, their rationality is limited by the tractability of the decision problem, the cognitive limitations of their minds, and the time available to make the decision.  Decision-makers in this view act as satisficers, seeking a satisfactory solution rather than an optimal one.  Herbert A.  Simon proposed bounded rationality as an alternative basis for the mathematical modeling of decision-making, as used in economics, political science and related disciplines.  It complements "rationality as optimization", which views decision-making as a fully rational process of finding an optimal choice given the information available. 

Satisficing<====>70401<====>SatisficingSatisficing is a decision-making strategy or cognitive heuristic that entails searching through the available alternatives until an acceptability threshold is met.   The term satisficing, a combination of satisfy and suffice,  was introduced by Herbert A.  Simon in 1956,  although the concept was first posited in his 1947 book Administrative Behavior.   Simon used satisficing to explain the behavior of decision makers under circumstances in which an optimal solution cannot be determined.  He maintained that many natural problems are characterized by computational intractability or a lack of information, both of which preclude the use of mathematical optimization procedures. 

Gestalt psychology<====>70402<====>Gestalt psychology  Gestalt psychology or gestaltism  (    "shape, form") is a philosophy of mind of the Berlin School of experimental psychology.  Gestalt psychology is an attempt to understand the laws behind the ability to acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions in an apparently chaotic world.  The central principle of gestalt psychology is that the mind forms a global whole with self-organizing tendencies.  The assumed physiological mechanisms on which Gestalt theory rests are poorly defined and support for their existence is lacking.    The Gestalt theory of perception has been criticized as being descriptive of the end products of perception without providing much insight into the processes that lead to perception.

Elo rating system<====>70421<====>Elo rating systemThe Elo  rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in zero-sum games such as chess.  It is named after its creator Arpad Elo, a Hungarian-born American physics professor. The Elo system was originally invented as an improved chess rating system, but is also used as a rating system for multiplayer competition in a number of video games,  association football, American football, basketball,  Major League Baseball, Scrabble, board games such as Diplomacy and other games. The difference in the ratings between two players serves as a predictor of the outcome of a match. 

Esker<====>70423<====>Esker  An esker, eskar, eschar, or os, sometimes called an asar, osar, or serpent kame,   is a long, winding ridge of stratified sand and gravel, examples of which occur in glaciated and formerly glaciated regions of Europe and North America.  Eskers are frequently several kilometres long and, because of their peculiar uniform shape, are somewhat like railway embankments.  EtymologyThe term esker is derived from the Irish word eiscir (Old Irish: escir), which means "ridge or elevation, especially one separating two plains or depressed surfaces".  The Irish word was and is used particularly to describe long sinuous ridges, which are now known to be deposits of fluvio-glacial material. 

Inflammation<====>70425<====>Inflammation Inflammation (from Latin  ) is part of the complex biological response of body tissues to harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants,    and is a protective response involving immune cells, blood vessels, and molecular mediators.  The function of inflammation is to eliminate the initial cause of cell injury, clear out necrotic cells and tissues damaged from the original insult and the inflammatory process, and initiate tissue repair. The classical signs of inflammation are heat, pain, redness, swelling, and loss of function.  Inflammation is a generic response, and therefore it is considered as a mechanism of innate immunity, as compared to adaptive immunity, which is specific for each pathogen. 

Edema<====>70426<====>Edema    Edema, also spelled oedema or œdema, is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the interstitium, located beneath the skin and in the cavities of the body, which can cause severe pain.  Clinically, edema manifests as swelling.  The amount of interstitial fluid is determined by the balance of fluid homeostasis; and the increased secretion of fluid into the interstitium, or the impaired removal of the fluid, can cause the condition.  The word is from Greek   oídēma meaning "swelling".   ClassificationsCutaneous edema is referred to as "pitting" when, after pressure is applied to a small area, the indentation persists after the release of the pressure. 

The Quiet Man<====>70428<====>The Quiet Man  The Quiet Man is a 1952 Technicolor American romantic comedy-drama film directed by John Ford.

Nugent was based on a 1933 Saturday Evening Post short story of the same name by Maurice Walsh, later published as part of a collection The Green Rushes.  The film is notable for Winton Hoch's lush photography of the Irish countryside and a long, climactic, semi-comic fist fight.  It was an official selection of the 1952 Venice Film Festival. 

Emic and etic<====>70432<====>Emic and etic  In anthropology, folkloristics, and the social and behavioral sciences, emic and etic refer to two kinds of field research done and viewpoints obtained:  emic, from within the social group (from the perspective of the subject) and etic, from outside (from the perspective of the observer). Definitions"The emic approach investigates how local people think" (Kottak, 2006): How they perceive and categorize the world, their rules for behavior, what has meaning for them, and how they imagine and explain things.  "The etic (scientist-oriented) approach shifts the focus from local observations, categories, explanations, and interpretations to those of the anthropologist. 

Battle of Vimy Ridge<====>70435<====>Battle of Vimy Ridge   The Battle of Vimy Ridge was a military engagement fought primarily as part of the Battle of Arras, in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region of France, during the First World War.  The main combatants were the four divisions of the Canadian Corps in the First Army, against three divisions of the German 6th Army.  The battle, which took place from 9 to 12 April 1917, was part of the opening phase of the Battle of Arras, the first attack of the Nivelle Offensive, intended to attract German reserves from the French front. The objective of the Canadian Corps was to take control of the German-held high ground along an escarpment at the northernmost end of the Arras Offensive.

Fisher was also an academic, and eventually served as Chancellor of the University of Cambridge. Fisher was executed by order of Henry VIII during the English Reformation for refusing to accept the King as Supreme Head of the Church of England and for upholding the Catholic Church's doctrine of papal primacy.  He was named a cardinal shortly before his death.  He is honoured as a martyr and saint by the Catholic Church.

Tritone<====>70443<====>Tritone  In music theory, the tritone is defined as a musical interval composed of three adjacent whole tones.   For instance, the interval from F up to the B above it (in short, F–B) is a tritone as it can be decomposed into the three adjacent whole tones F–G, G–A, and A–B.  According to this definition, within a diatonic scale there is only one tritone for each octave.  For instance, the above-mentioned interval F–B is the only tritone formed from the notes of the C major scale.  A tritone is also commonly defined as an interval spanning six semitones.

Geordie<====>70489<====>Geordie Geordie   is both a regional nickname for a person from the larger Tyneside    region of North East England and the name of the Northern English dialect spoken by its inhabitants.  The term is associated with Tyneside, south Northumberland and northern parts of County Durham.  Geordie has been used and still is used by people to refer to anyone from North East England.  In many respects, Geordie speech represents a direct continuation and development of the language spoken by the Anglo-Saxon settlers of this region – initially mercenaries employed by the ancient Brythons to fight the Pictish invaders after the end of Roman rule in Britannia in the 5th century. 

A Short History of the Confederate States of America<====>70492<====>A Short History of the Confederate States of America A Short History of the Confederate States of America is a memoir written by Jefferson Davis, completed shortly before his death in 1889.   Davis wrote most of this book while staying at Beauvoir along the Mississippi Gulf Coast near Biloxi, Mississippi. The book is much less a Davis memoir than an articulation of the secession argument.   In Davis' earlier work, The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, he had written what is probably the most thorough exegesis of the compact theory of the United States Constitution in existence, devoting the first fifteen chapters of the book to that topic.

One of the languages of Arda in Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium, it was spoken by the Men of Númenor during the Second Age. Fictional history Adûnaic derived from the closely related Bëorian and Hadorian dialects of Taliska, the language spoken by the first and third houses of the Edain when they first entered Beleriand during the First Age (the language(s) of the second house, the Haladin, seems to have had little or no influence on Adûnaic whatsoever, despite the apparent presence of both the Haladin and the Drúedain in Númenor prior to its downfall).

When designating instruments, "alto" likewise can refer either to the corresponding vocal range (alto flute and alto trombone) or to musical role (alto recorder and alto clarinet). EtymologyIn choral music for mixed voices, "alto" describes the lowest part commonly sung by women.  The explanation for the anomaly of this name is to be found not in the use of adult falsettists in choirs of men and boys but further back in innovations in composition during the mid-15th century.

Baritone<====>70502<====>Baritone  A baritone  is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range lies between the bass and the tenor voice types.  It is the most common male voice.    Originally from the Greek  , meaning heavy sounding, music for this voice is typically written in the range from the second F below middle C to the F above middle C (i. e.  F 2 –F 4 ) in choral music, and from the second A below middle C to the A above middle C (A 2  to A 4 ) in operatic music, but can be extended at either end.

Nosology<====>70533<====>Nosology Nosology ( ) is a classification scheme within medicine delineating classification of diseases. Types of classificationDiseases may be classified by cause, pathogenesis (mechanism by which the disease is caused), or by symptom(s). Alternatively, diseases may be classified according to the organ system involved, though this is often complicated since many diseases affect more than one organ. A chief difficulty in nosology is that diseases often cannot be defined and classified clearly, especially when cause or pathogenesis are unknown.  Thus diagnostic terms often only reflect a symptom or set of symptoms (syndrome). Traditionally diseases were defined as syndromes by their symptoms.

Hemolysis<====>70585<====>Hemolysis    Hemolysis or haemolysis, also known by several other names, is the rupturing (lysis) of red blood cells (erythrocytes) and the release of their contents (cytoplasm) into surrounding fluid (e. g.  blood plasma).  Hemolysis may occur in vivo or in vitro (inside or outside the body). Hemolysins damage the host cytoplasmic membrane, causing cell lysis and death.  The activity of these toxins is most easily observed with assays involving the lysis of red blood cells (erythrocytes).  Some hemolysins attack the phospholipid of the host cytoplasmic membrane.  Because the phospholipid lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) is often used as a substrate, these enzymes are called lecithinases or phospholipases.

Van der Waals force<====>70657<====>Van der Waals forceIn physical chemistry, the van der Waals forces, named after Dutch scientist Johannes Diderik van der Waals, are distance-dependent interactions between atoms or molecules.  Unlike ionic or covalent bonds, these attractions are not a result of any chemical electronic bond, and they are comparatively weak and more susceptible to being perturbed.  Van der Waals forces quickly vanish at longer distances between interacting molecules. Van der Waals forces play a fundamental role in fields as diverse as supramolecular chemistry, structural biology, polymer science, nanotechnology, surface science, and condensed matter physics.  Van der Waals forces also define many properties of organic compounds and molecular solids, including their solubility in polar and non-polar media.

Chaffing and winnowing<====>70662<====>Chaffing and winnowing Chaffing and winnowing is a cryptographic technique to achieve confidentiality without using encryption when sending data over an insecure channel.  The name is derived from agriculture: after grain has been harvested and threshed, it remains mixed together with inedible fibrous chaff.   The chaff and grain are then separated by winnowing, and the chaff is discarded.  The technique was conceived by Ron Rivest and published in an on-line article on 18 March 1998.  Rivest's article on chaffing and winnowing  Although it bears similarities to both traditional encryption and steganography, it cannot be classified under either category. 

Brine<====>70663<====>Brine  Brine is a high-concentration solution of salt (usually sodium chloride) in water.   In different contexts, brine may refer to salt solutions ranging from about 3. 5% (a typical concentration of seawater, on the lower end of solutions used for brining foods) up to about 26% (a typical saturated solution, depending on temperature).  Lower levels of concentration are called by different names: fresh water, brackish water and saline water. Brine naturally occurs on Earth's surface (salt lakes), crust, and within brine pools on ocean bottom.  High-concentration brine lakes typically emerge due to evaporation of ground saline water on high ambient temperatures.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy<====>70847<====>X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a surface-sensitive quantitative spectroscopic technique that measures the elemental composition at the parts per thousand range, empirical formula, chemical state and electronic state of the elements that exist within a material.  XPS spectra are obtained by irradiating a material with a beam of X-rays while simultaneously measuring the kinetic energy and number of electrons that escape from the top 0 to 10 nm of the material being analyzed.  XPS requires high vacuum (P ~ 10 −8  millibar) or ultra-high vacuum (UHV; P  −9  millibar) conditions, although a current area of development is ambient-pressure XPS, in which samples are analyzed at pressures of a few tens of millibar.

Jackson structured programming<====>70973<====>Jackson structured programmingJackson structured programming (JSP) is a method for structured programming based on correspondences between data stream structure and program structure.   JSP structures programs and data in terms of sequences, iterations and selections, and as a consequence it is applied when designing a program's detailed control structure.  The method applies to processing of any data structure or data stream that is describable as a hierarchical structure of sequential, optional and iterated elements.  This could be a stream of messages that a process reads to invoke and coordinate other modules or objects, or it could be a string of characters in parameters passed to a single operation on an "object" coded in an object-oriented programming language.

Molar volume<====>70989<====>Molar volumeThe molar volume, symbol V m ,    is the volume occupied by one mole of a substance (chemical element or chemical compound) at a given temperature and pressure.  It is equal to the molar mass (M) divided by the mass density (ρ).  It has the SI unit cubic metres per mole (m 3 /mol),  although it is more practical to use the units cubic decimetres per mole (dm 3 /mol) for gases and cubic centimetres per mole (cm 3 /mol) for liquids and solids. CalculationThe molar volume of a substance can be found by measuring its molar mass and density then applying the relation V_{\rm m} = {M\over\rho} .

Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy<====>71020<====>Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopyUltraviolet–visible spectroscopy or ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry (UV-Vis or UV/Vis) refers to absorption spectroscopy or reflectance spectroscopy in the ultraviolet-visible spectral region.  This means it uses light in the visible and adjacent ranges.  The absorption or reflectance in the visible range directly affects the perceived color of the chemicals involved.  In this region of the electromagnetic spectrum, atoms and molecules undergo electronic transitions.  Absorption spectroscopy is complementary to fluorescence spectroscopy, in that fluorescence deals with transitions from the excited state to the ground state, while absorption measures transitions from the ground state to the excited state.    Principle of ultraviolet-visible absorptionMolecules containing π-electrons or non-bonding electrons (n-electrons) can absorb the energy in the form of ultraviolet or visible light to excite these electrons to higher anti-bonding molecular orbitals.

Shannon–Hartley theorem<====>71085<====>Shannon–Hartley theoremIn information theory, the Shannon–Hartley theorem tells the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over a communications channel of a specified bandwidth in the presence of noise.   It is an application of the noisy-channel coding theorem to the archetypal case of a continuous-time analog communications channel subject to Gaussian noise.  The theorem establishes Shannon's channel capacity for such a communication link, a bound on the maximum amount of error-free information per time unit that can be transmitted with a specified bandwidth in the presence of the noise interference, assuming that the signal power is bounded, and that the Gaussian noise process is characterized by a known power or power spectral density. 

Hibernation<====>71088<====>Hibernation  Hibernation is a state of inactivity and metabolic depression in endotherms.  Hibernation refers to a season of heterothermy characterized by low body temperature, slow breathing and heart rate, and low metabolic rate.  Although traditionally reserved for "deep" hibernators such as rodents, the term has been redefined to include animals such as bears and is now applied based on active metabolic suppression rather than absolute body temperature decline.  Many experts believe that the processes of daily torpor and hibernation form a continuum and utilize similar mechanisms.   The equivalent during the summer months is aestivation.

Laws of science<====>71110<====>Laws of science  The laws of science, scientific laws, or scientific principles are statements that describe or predict a range of phenomena as they appear in nature.   The term "law" has diverse usage in many cases: approximate, accurate, broad or narrow theories, in all natural scientific disciplines (physics, chemistry, biology, geology, astronomy etc. ).  Scientific laws summarize and explain a large collection of facts determined by experiment, and are tested based on their ability to predict the results of future experiments.  They are developed either from facts or through mathematics, and are strongly supported by empirical evidence. 

Wigner's friend<====>71119<====>Wigner's friend Wigner's friend is a thought experiment proposed by the physicist Eugene Wigner; it is a variation of the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment in which, from the point of view of a human observer, a second observer is in a state of quantum superposition. The thought experimentThe thought experiment posits a friend of Wigner who performs the Schrödinger's cat experiment after Wigner leaves the laboratory.  Only when he returns does Wigner learn the result of the experiment from his friend, that is, whether the cat is alive or dead.   The question is raised: was the state of the system a superposition of "dead cat/sad friend" and "live cat/happy friend," only determined when Wigner learned the result of the experiment, or was it determined at some previous point?Wigner's original remarks about his friend appeared in his article "Remarks on the Mind-Body Question", published in the book The Scientist Speculates (1961), edited by I.

Pink triangle<====>71135<====>Pink triangle In Nazi Germany, pink triangles ( )  were used as one of the Nazi concentration camp badges, used to identify male prisoners who were sent there because of their homosexuality.    Every prisoner had to wear a downward-pointing triangle on their jacket, the colour of which was to categorise them by "kind".   Other colors identified Jewish people (two triangles superimposed as a yellow star), political prisoners, Jehovah's Witnesses, "anti-social" prisoners, and others the Nazis deemed undesirable.  Pink and yellow triangles could be combined if a prisoner was deemed to be gay and Jewish. 

Wave function collapse<====>71138<====>Wave function collapse In quantum mechanics, wave function collapse is said to occur when a wave function—initially in a superposition of several eigenstates—appears to reduce to a single eigenstate (by "observation").  It is the essence of measurement in quantum mechanics and connects the wave function with classical observables like position and momentum.  Collapse is one of two processes by which quantum systems evolve in time; the other is continuous evolution via the Schrödinger equation.  However, in this role, collapse is merely a black box for thermodynamically irreversible interaction with a classical environment. 

Star of India (ship)<====>71153<====>Star of India (ship)  }Star of India was built in 1863 at Ramsey in the Isle of Man as Euterpe, a full-rigged iron windjammer ship.

Euterpe<====>71156<====>Euterpe   In Greek mythology, Euterpe ( ;  ,  ,  ; "rejoicing well" or "delight" from Ancient Greek εὖ 'well' + τέρπειν terpein 'to please') was one of the Muses, the daughters of Mnemosyne, fathered by Zeus.   Called the "Giver of delight", when later poets assigned roles to each of the Muses, she was the muse of music.   In late Classical times she was named muse of lyric poetry  and depicted holding a flute.  A few say she invented the aulos or double-flute, though most mythographers credit Marsyas with its invention. 

Muses<====>71180<====>Muses The Muses (/ˈmjuːzɪz/; Ancient Greek: Μοῦσαι, Moũsai) are the inspirational goddesses of literature, science, and the arts in Greek mythology.  They were considered the source of the knowledge embodied in the poetry, lyric songs, and myths that were related orally for centuries in these ancient cultures.  They were later adopted by the Romans as a part of their pantheon. In current English usage, "muse" can refer in general to a person who inspires an artist, musician, or writer.  EtymologyThe word "Muses" ( ;  , Moũsai) perhaps came from the o-grade of the Proto-Indo-European root *men- ("to think")  or from root *men- ("to tower, mountain") since all the most important cult-centres of the Muses were on mountains or hills.

Before the speech the Armada had been driven from the Strait of Dover in the Battle of Gravelines eleven days earlier, and had by then rounded Scotland on its way home, but troops were still held at ready in case the Spanish army of Alexander Farnese, the Duke of Parma, might yet attempt to invade from Dunkirk; two days later they were discharged. 

Domenico Maria Novara da Ferrara<====>71204<====>Domenico Maria Novara da Ferrara  Domenico Maria Novara (1454–1504) was an Italian scientist. LifeBorn in Ferrara, for 21 years he was professor of astronomy at the University of Bologna, and in 1500 he also lectured in mathematics at Rome.  He was notable as a Platonist astronomer, and in 1496 he taught Nicholas Copernicus astronomy.  He was also an astrologer, perhaps for financial gain, as was common at the time. At Bologna, Novara was assisted by Copernicus, with whom he observed a lunar occultation of Aldebaran.  Copernicus later used this observation to disprove Ptolemy's model of lunar distance. 

Orange (colour)<====>71234<====>Orange (colour) Orange is the colour between yellow and red on the spectrum of visible light.  Human eyes perceive orange when observing light with a dominant wavelength between roughly 585 and 620 nanometres.   In painting and traditional colour theory, it is a secondary colour of pigments, created by mixing red and yellow.  It is named after the fruit of the same name. The orange colour of carrots, pumpkins, sweet potatoes, oranges,  and many other fruits and vegetables comes from carotenes, a type of photosynthetic pigment.  These pigments convert the light energy that the plants absorb from the sun into chemical energy for the plants' growth. 

Lewis chessmen<====>71246<====>Lewis chessmen  The Lewis chessmen ( ;  ;  ) or Uig chessmen, named after the bay where they were found,  are a group of distinctive 12th-century chess pieces, along with other gaming pieces, most of which are carved in walrus ivory.  Discovered in 1831 on Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland,  they may constitute some of the few complete, surviving medieval chess sets, although it is not clear if a set as originally made can be assembled from the pieces.  When found, the hoard contained 93 artifacts: 78 chess pieces, 14 tablemen and one belt buckle. 

Great Leap Forward<====>71262<====>Great Leap Forward   The Great Leap Forward ( ) of the People's Republic of China (PRC) was an economic and social campaign by the Communist Party of China (CPC) from 1958 to 1962.  The campaign was led by Chairman Mao Zedong and aimed to rapidly transform the country from an agrarian economy into a socialist society through rapid industrialization and collectivization.  However, it is widely considered to have caused the Great Chinese Famine. Chief changes in the lives of rural Chinese included the incremental introduction of mandatory agricultural collectivization.  Private farming was prohibited, and those engaged in it were persecuted and labeled counter-revolutionaries. 

Senecio<====>71265<====>Senecio  Senecio   is a genus of the daisy family (Asteraceae) that includes ragworts and groundsels.  The scientific Latin genus name,  , means "old man. " Variously circumscribed taxonomically, the genus Senecio is one of the largest genera of flowering plants.  The traditional circumscription of Senecio is artificial, being polyphyletic, even in its new circumscription which is based on genetic data.    Despite the separation of many species into other genera, the genus still contains   species and is one of the largest genera of flowering plants.As no morphological synapomorphies are known to determine which species belong to the genus or not, no exact species numbers are known. 

Jacobaea vulgaris<====>71267<====>Jacobaea vulgaris  Jacobaea vulgaris, syn.  Senecio jacobaea,  is a very common wild flower in the family Asteraceae that is native to northern Eurasia, usually in dry, open places, and has also been widely distributed as a weed elsewhere. Common names include ragwort, common ragwort,    stinking willie,  tansy ragwort, benweed, St.  James-wort, stinking nanny/ninny/willy, staggerwort, dog standard, cankerwort, stammerwort.  In the western United States it is generally known as tansy ragwort, or tansy, though its resemblance to the true tansy is superficial. Although the plant is often unwanted by landowners because it is considered a weed by many, it provides a great deal of nectar for pollinators. 

Astrochemistry<====>71268<====>AstrochemistryAstrochemistry is the study of the abundance and reactions of molecules in the Universe, and their interaction with radiation.   The discipline is an overlap of astronomy and chemistry.   The word "astrochemistry" may be applied to both the Solar System and the interstellar medium.  The study of the abundance of elements and isotope ratios in Solar System objects, such as meteorites, is also called cosmochemistry, while the study of interstellar atoms and molecules and their interaction with radiation is sometimes called molecular astrophysics.  The formation, atomic and chemical composition, evolution and fate of molecular gas clouds is of special interest, because it is from these clouds that solar systems form. 

Mary of Guise<====>71280<====>Mary of Guise  Mary of Guise ( ; 22 November 1515 – 11 June 1560) was Queen consort of Scotland from 1538 to 1542 as the second wife of King James V.  She was the mother of  Mary, Queen of Scots, and served as Regent of Scotland in her daughter's name from 1554 to 1560.  A native of Lorraine, she was a member of the powerful House of Guise, which played a prominent role in 16th-century French politics.  Her main goal was a close alliance between the powerful French Catholic nation and smaller Scotland, which she wanted to be Catholic and independent of England. 

Extended Backus–Naur form<====>71289<====>Extended Backus–Naur formIn computer science, extended Backus-Naur form (EBNF) is a family of metasyntax notations, any of which can be used to express a context-free grammar.   EBNF is used to make a formal description of a formal language which can be a computer programming language.  They are extensions of the basic Backus–Naur form (BNF) metasyntax notation. The earliest EBNF was originally developed by Niklaus Wirth incorporating some of the concepts (with a different syntax and notation) from Wirth syntax notation.  However, many variants of EBNF are in use.  The International Organization for Standardization has adopted an EBNF standard (ISO/IEC 14977). 

England, England<====>71290<====>England, England   England, England is a satirical postmodern novel by Julian Barnes, published and shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1998.  While researchers have also pointed out the novel's characteristic dystopian and farcical elements,  Barnes himself described the novel as a 'semi-farce'.  England, England broaches the idea of replicating England in a theme park on the Isle of Wight.  It calls into question ideas of national identity, invented traditions, the creations of myths and the authenticity of history and memory.   Plot summaryEngland, England is divided into three parts entitled "England", "England, England" and " ". 

Porfirio Díaz<====>71299<====>Porfirio Díaz    José de la Cruz Porfirio Díaz Mori ( ; 15 September 1830 – 2 July 1915) was a Mexican general and politician who served seven terms as President of Mexico, a total of three and a half decades from 1876 to 1880 and from 1884 to 1911.  A veteran of the War of the Reform (1858–60) and the French intervention in Mexico (1862–67), Díaz rose to the rank of General, leading republican troops against the French-imposed rule of Emperor Maximilian.  Seizing power in a coup in 1876, Díaz and his allies, a group of technocrats known as "Científicos",  ruled Mexico for the next thirty-five years, a period known as the Porfiriato.

Zyklon B<====>71305<====>Zyklon B  Zyklon B ( ;  ; translated Cyclone B) was the trade name of a cyanide-based pesticide invented in Germany in the early 1920s.  It consisted of hydrogen cyanide (prussic acid), as well as a cautionary eye irritant and one of several adsorbents such as diatomaceous earth.  The product is infamous for its use by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust to murder approximately one   million people in gas chambers installed at Auschwitz-Birkenau, Majdanek, and other extermination camps. Hydrogen cyanide, a poisonous gas that interferes with cellular respiration, was first used as a pesticide in California in the 1880s.

100-year flood<====>71318<====>100-year flood A one-hundred-year flood is a flood event that has a 1% probability of occurring in any given year. The 100-year flood is also referred to as the 1% flood, since its annual exceedance probability is 1%.  Holmes, R. R. , Jr. , and Dinicola, K.  (2010) 100-Year flood–it's all about chance  U. S.  Geological Survey General Information Product 106   For river systems, the 100-year flood is generally expressed as a flowrate.    Based on the expected 100-year flood flow rate, the flood water level can be mapped as an area of inundation.

Lindisfarne Gospels<====>71325<====>Lindisfarne GospelsThe Lindisfarne Gospels (London, British Library Cotton MS Nero D. IV) is an illuminated manuscript gospel book produced around the year 700 in a monastery off the coast of Northumberland at Lindisfarne and which is now on display in the British Library in London.  The manuscript is one of the finest works in the unique style of Hiberno-Saxon or Insular art,  combining Mediterranean, Anglo-Saxon and Celtic elements.    The Lindisfarne Gospels is a religious and creative book.    The Lindisfarne Gospels are presumed to be the work of a monk named Eadfrith, who became Bishop of Lindisfarne in 698 and died in 721. 

John Backus<====>71331<====>John Backus   John Warner Backus (December 3, 1924 – March 17, 2007) was an American computer scientist.  He directed the team that invented and implemented FORTRAN, the first widely used  high-level programming language, and was the inventor of the Backus–Naur form (BNF), a widely used notation to define formal language syntax.  He later did research into the function-level programming paradigm, presenting his findings in his influential 1977 Turing Award lecture "Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style?"The IEEE awarded Backus the W.  W.  McDowell Award in 1967 for the development of FORTRAN. 

Grenadier<====>71349<====>Grenadier A grenadier (from French, derived from the word grenade ) was originally a specialized soldier, first established as a distinct role in the mid-to-late 17th century, for the throwing of grenades and sometimes assault operations.  At that time grenadiers were chosen from the strongest and largest soldiers.  By the 18th century, dedicated grenade throwing of this sort was no longer relevant, but grenadiers were still chosen for being the most physically powerful soldiers and would lead assaults in the field of battle.  Grenadiers would also often lead the storming of fortification breaches in siege warfare, although this role was more usually fulfilled by all-arm units of volunteers called forlorn hopes, and might also be fulfilled by sappers or pioneers. 

Anne of Bohemia<====>71370<====>Anne of Bohemia   Anne of Bohemia (11 May 1366 – 7 June 1394) was Queen of England as the first wife of King Richard II.  A member of the House of Luxembourg, she was the eldest daughter of  Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Bohemia, and Elizabeth of Pomerania.    She died at 28 after 12 years of marriage; she was childless, and greatly mourned by her husband.  The marriage was initially unpopular in England inasmuch as, even though Anne's father was perhaps the most powerful monarch in Europe, his relatively distant area of influence could give little trade or political advantage to England, and Anne brought no dowry; instead Richard had to pay her brother a sum. 

Ed Gein<====>71376<====>Ed Gein Edward Theodore Gein ( ; August 27, 1906 Vital Records, Pre-1907 Wisconsin.  "Birth Index Record: Gien, Edward".   – July 26, 1984), also known as The Butcher of Plainfield, was an American murderer and body snatcher.  His crimes, committed around his hometown of Plainfield, Wisconsin, gathered widespread notoriety after authorities discovered that Gein had exhumed corpses from local graveyards and fashioned trophies and keepsakes from their bones and skin.  Gein confessed to killing two women – tavern owner Mary Hogan in 1954, and a Plainfield hardware store owner, Bernice Worden in 1957. 

Rock crystal vase<====>71377<====>Rock crystal vaseA rock crystal vase is a vase made of rock crystal, a type of hardstone carving.  Such vases were rare, expensive, and decorated with gold and jewels, used by royalty in Europe. A rock crystal vase that probably originated in the seventh century was given to William IX of Aquitaine (the Troubadour) by a Muslim ally.  When Eleanor of Aquitaine, William IX's granddaughter, married King Louis VII of France in 1137, she gave him the rock crystal vase as a wedding present.   The inscription on it says he, in turn, gave it to the Abbey of St.

Early lifeRaised on a dairy farm, as the youngest of four children, and the only girl in the family Tyus was encouraged by her father to participate in sport.While a high school athlete Tyus participated in basketball and began her track endeavors as a high jumper before transitioning to the sprints after being invited to a summer track clinic at Tennessee State University in 1960. 

Jane Jacobs<====>71394<====>Jane Jacobs  Jane Jacobs   (born Jane Butzner; May 4, 1916 – April 25, 2006) was an American-Canadian journalist, author, and activist best known for her influence on urban studies, sociology, and economics.  Her influential book The Death and Life of Great American Cities (1961) argued that urban renewal did not respect the needs of most city-dwellers.  In the book she introduced sociological concepts such as "eyes on the street" and "social capital".Jacobs was well known for organizing grassroots efforts to protect existing neighborhoods from "slum clearance" – and particularly for her opposition to Robert Moses in his plans to overhaul her neighborhood, Greenwich Village. 

Cedilla<====>71396<====>Cedilla    A cedilla (   ; from Spanish), also known as cedilha (from Portuguese) or cédille (from French), is a hook or tail ( ¸ ) added under certain letters as a diacritical mark to modify their pronunciation.  In Catalan, French, and Portuguese, it is used only under the c, and the entire letter is called respectively c trencada (i. e.  "broken C"), c cédille, and c cedilhado (or c de cedilha, colloquially).  This symbol is also called snaked c. OriginThe tail originated in Spain as the bottom half of a miniature cursive z. 

Cadaver tomb<====>71397<====>Cadaver tombA cadaver tomb or transi (or memento mori tomb, Latin for "reminder of death") is a type of gisant (recumbent effigy tomb) featuring an effigy in the form of a decomposing corpse.  The topos was particularly characteristic of the later Middle Ages.  OverviewA depiction of a rotting cadaver in art (as opposed to a skeleton) is called a transi.  However, the term "cadaver tomb" can really be applied to other varieties of monuments, e. g.  with skeletons or with the deceased completely wrapped in a shroud.  In the "double-decker" tombs, in Erwin Panofsky's phrase,  a carved stone bier displays on the top level the recumbent effigy or gisant of a person as they were before death or soon after their death, where they may be life-sized and sometimes represented kneeling in prayer, and as a rotting cadaver on the bottom level, often shrouded and sometimes complete with worms and other flesh-eating wildlife.

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma<====>71418<====>Non-Hodgkin lymphoma  Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a group of blood cancers that includes all types of lymphoma except Hodgkin's lymphomas.   Symptoms include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and tiredness.   Other symptoms may include bone pain, chest pain, or itchiness.   Some forms are slow growing while others are fast growing.Lymphomas are types of cancer that develop from lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell.   Risk factors include poor immune function, autoimmune diseases, Helicobacter pylori infection, hepatitis C, obesity, and Epstein-Barr virus infection. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies lymphomas into five major groups, including one for Hodgkin's lymphoma. 

Manuel Noriega<====>71421<====>Manuel NoriegaManuel Antonio Noriega Moreno ( ; February 11, 1934 – May 29, 2017)   was a Panamanian politician and military officer who was the de facto ruler of Panama from 1983 to 1989.  He had longstanding ties to United States intelligence agencies: however, he was removed from power by the U. S.  invasion of Panama. Born in Panama City to a poor mestizo family, Noriega studied at the Chorrillos Military School in Lima and at the School of the Americas.  He became an officer in the Panamanian army, and rose through the ranks in alliance with Omar Torrijos. 

Lymphoma<====>71422<====>Lymphoma  Lymphoma is a group of blood cancers that develop from lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).   The name often refers to just the cancerous versions rather than all such tumors.Signs and symptoms may include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, drenching sweats, unintended weight loss, itching, and constantly feeling tired.    The enlarged lymph nodes are usually painless.   The sweats are most common at night.   There are dozens of subtypes of lymphomas.   The two main categories of lymphomas are Hodgkin's lymphomas (HL) and the non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). 

Lymphatic system<====>71425<====>Lymphatic system  The lymphatic system is part of the circulatory system and an important part of the immune system, comprising a network of lymphatic vessels that carry a clear fluid called  lymph (from Latin, lympha meaning "water" ) directionally towards the heart.  The lymphatic system was first described in the seventeenth century independently by Olaus Rudbeck and Thomas Bartholin.   Unlike the circulatory system, the lymphatic system is not a closed system.  The human circulatory system processes an average of 20 liters of blood per day through capillary filtration, which removes plasma while leaving the blood cells. 

2000 Summer Olympics<====>71432<====>2000 Summer Olympics The 2000 Summer Olympic Games, officially known as the Games of the XXVII Olympiad and commonly known as Sydney 2000 or the Millennium Olympic Games/Games of the New Millennium, were an international multi-sport event which was held between 15 September and 1 October 2000 in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.  It was the second time that the Summer Olympics were held in Australia, and also the Southern Hemisphere, the first being in Melbourne, Victoria, in 1956. Sydney was selected as the host city for the 2000 games in 1993.  Teams from 199 countries participated. 

Universal Turing machine<====>71435<====>Universal Turing machine  In computer science, a universal Turing machine (UTM) is a Turing machine that can simulate an arbitrary Turing machine on arbitrary input.  The universal machine essentially achieves this by reading both the description of the machine to be simulated as well as the input thereof from its own tape.  Alan Turing introduced the idea of such a machine in 1936–1937.  This principle is considered to be the origin of the idea of a stored-program computer used by John von Neumann in 1946 for the "Electronic Computing Instrument" that now bears von Neumann's name: the von Neumann architecture. 

Vafþrúðnir<====>71439<====>VafþrúðnirVafþrúðnir (Old Norse "mighty weaver" Orchard (1997:170).  ) is a wise jötunn in Norse mythology.  His name comes from Vaf, which means weave or entangle, and thrudnir, which means strong or mighty.  Some interpret it to mean “mighty in riddles”.  Du Chaillu, P.  B.  (1889).   It may be anglicized Vafthruthnir or Vafthrudnir.  In the Poetic Edda poem Vafþrúðnismál, Vafþrúðnir acts as (the disguised) Odin's host and opponent in a deadly battle of wits that results in Vafþrúðnir's defeat. CharacterizationA small portion of Poetic Edda provides some context and description of Vafthrudnir. 

Remake<====>71440<====>Remake   A remake is a film or television series that is based on an earlier work and tells the same, or a very similar, story.   A reimagining however, is a remake that is not directly identical to the original. FilmThe term "remake" is generally used in reference to a movie which uses an earlier movie as the main source material, rather than in reference to a second, later movie based on the same source.  For example, 2001's Ocean's Eleven is a remake of Ocean's 11, while 1989's Batman is a re-interpretation of the comic book source material which also inspired 1966's Batman. 

Moab<====>71454<====>Moab   Moab ( ; Moabite:   mʾb;   muʾāb;  ;   Mōáb; Assyrian Mu'aba, Ma'ba, Ma'ab; Egyptian Mu'ab) is the historical name for a mountainous tract of land in Jordan.  The land lies alongside much of the eastern shore of the Dead Sea.  The existence of the Kingdom of Moab is attested to by numerous archaeological findings, most notably the Mesha Stele, which describes the Moabite victory over an unnamed son of King Omri of Israel.   The Moabite capital was Dibon.  According to the Hebrew Bible, Moab was often in conflict with its Israelite neighbours to the west. 

Smith's Bible Dictionary<====>71457<====>Smith's Bible Dictionary Smith's Bible Dictionary, originally named A Dictionary of the Bible, is a 19th-century Bible dictionary containing upwards of four thousand entries that became named after its editor, William Smith.  Its popularity was such that condensed dictionaries appropriated the title, "Smith's Bible Dictionary". The original dictionary was published as a three-volume set in 1863, in London and Boston, USA.  This was followed by A Concise Dictionary of the Bible (1865), intended for the general reader and students, and A Smaller Dictionary of the Bible (1866), for use in schools.  A Comprehensive Dictionary of the Bible (1868), was published simultaneously in London and New York, and a four-volume Dictionary of the Bible (1871), was published in Boston, amongst other things incorporating the appendices of the first edition into the main body of the text. 

Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou<====>71464<====>Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou    Geoffrey V (24 August 1113 – 7 September 1151) — called the Handsome or the Fair ( ) and Plantagenet — was the Count of Anjou, Touraine, and Maine by inheritance from 1129 and then Duke of Normandy by conquest from 1144.  By his marriage to the Empress Matilda, daughter and heiress of Henry I of England, Geoffrey had a son, Henry Curtmantle, who succeeded to the English throne as King Henry II (1154-1189) and was the first of the Plantagenet dynasty to rule England; the name "Plantagenet" was taken from Geoffrey's epithet. 

Joule per mole<====>71468<====>Joule per mole The joule per mole (symbol: J·mole −1  or J/mol) is an SI derived unit of energy per amount of material.  Energy is measured in joules, and the amount of material is measured in moles.  For example, Gibbs free energy is quantified as joules per mole.  Since 1 mole = 6. 02214179×10 23  particles (atoms, molecules, ions etc. ), 1 Joule per mole is equal to 1 Joule divided by 6. 02214179×10 23  particles, or 1. 66054×10 −24  Joule per particle.  This very small amount of energy is often expressed in terms of a smaller unit such as the electronvolt (eV, see below). 

Barn (unit)<====>71469<====>Barn (unit)A barn (symbol: b) is a unit of area equal to 10 −28  m 2  (100 fm 2 ).  Originally used in nuclear physics for expressing the cross sectional area of nuclei and nuclear reactions, today it is also used in all fields of high-energy physics to express the cross sections of any scattering process, and is best understood as a measure of the probability of interaction between small particles.  A barn is  approximately the cross-sectional area of a uranium nucleus.  The barn is also the unit of area used in nuclear quadrupole resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance to quantify the interaction of a nucleus with an electric field gradient. 

Two-up<====>71470<====>Two-up   Two-up is a traditional Australian gambling game, involving a designated "spinner" throwing two coins or pennies into the air.  Players bet on whether the coins will fall with both heads (obverse) up, both tails (reverse) up, or with one coin a head and one a tail (known as "odds").  It is traditionally played on Anzac Day in pubs and clubs throughout Australia, in part to mark a shared experience with Diggers through the ages.

The technology is useful where the physical connections are impractical due to high costs or other considerations. HistoryOptical communications, in various forms, have been used for thousands of years.  The Ancient Greeks used a coded alphabetic system of signalling with torches developed by Cleoxenus, Democleitus and Polybius.   In the modern era, semaphores and wireless solar telegraphs called heliographs were developed, using coded signals to communicate with their recipients.

Infrared Data Association<====>71589<====>Infrared Data AssociationThe Infrared Data Association (IrDA) is an industry-driven interest group that was founded in 1993 by around 50 companies.   IrDA provides specifications for a complete set of protocols for wireless infrared communications, and the name "IrDA" also refers to that set of protocols.   The main reason for using IrDA had been wireless data transfer over the “last one meter” using point-and-shoot principles.   Thus, it has been implemented in portable devices such as mobile telephones, laptops, cameras, printers, and medical devices.   Main characteristics of this kind of wireless optical communication is physically secure data transfer, line-of-sight (LOS) and very low bit error rate (BER) that makes it very efficient.

JPEG File Interchange Format<====>71624<====>JPEG File Interchange FormatThe JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF) is an image file format standard.  It is a format for exchanging JPEG encoded files compliant with the JPEG Interchange Format (JIF) standard.  It solves some of JIF's limitations in regard to simple JPEG encoded file interchange.  As with all JIF compliant files, image data in JFIF files is compressed using the techniques in the JPEG standard, hence JFIF is sometimes referred to as "JPEG/JFIF". PurposeJFIF defines a number of details that are left unspecified by the JPEG Part 1 standard (ISO/IEC 10918-1, ITU-T Recommendation T. 81   ):Component sample registrationJPEG allows multiple components (such as Y, Cb, and Cr) to have different resolutions, but it does not define how those differing sample arrays should be aligned.

BiographyEarly yearsWilliam Ronald Reid Jr. , called Bill, was born in Victoria, British Columbia; his father was American William Ronald Reid Sr. , of Scottish-German descent  and his mother, Sophie Gladstone Reid, was from the Kaadaas gaah Kiiguwaay, Raven/Wolf Clan of T'anuu, more commonly known as the Haida, one of the First Nations of the Pacific coast. 

Integrated geography<====>71627<====>Integrated geographyIntegrated geography (also referred to as integrative geography,  environmental geography or human–environment geography) is the branch of geography that describes and explains the spatial aspects of interactions between human individuals or societies and their natural environment.   These interactions being called coupled human–environment systems. OriginsIt requires an understanding of the dynamics of physical geography, as well as the ways in which human societies conceptualize the environment (human geography).  Thus, to a certain degree, it may be seen as a successor of Physische Anthropogeographie (English: "physical anthropogeography")—a term coined by University of Vienna geographer Albrecht Penck in 1924 —and geographical cultural or human ecology (Harlan H. 

Unicity distance<====>71630<====>Unicity distance In cryptography, unicity distance is the length of an original ciphertext needed to break the cipher by reducing the number of possible spurious keys to zero in a brute force attack.  That is, after trying every possible key, there should be just one decipherment that makes sense, i. e.  expected amount of ciphertext needed to determine the key completely, assuming the underlying message has redundancy.    Claude Shannon defined the unicity distance in his 1949 paper "Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems. "Consider an attack on the ciphertext string "WNAIW" encrypted using a Vigenère cipher with a five letter key. 

Cytomegalovirus<====>71635<====>Cytomegalovirus   Cytomegalovirus (CMV) (from the Greek cyto-, "cell", and megalo-, "large") is a genus of viruses in the order Herpesvirales, in the family (150-200nm in diameter [hiv virus 120nm]) Herpesviridae, in the subfamily Betaherpesvirinae.  Humans and monkeys serve as natural hosts.  There are currently eight species in this genus including the type species, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV, human herpesvirus 5, HHV-5), which is the species that infects humans.  Diseases associated with HHV-5 include glandular fever, and pneumonia.   In the medical literature, most mentions of CMV without further specification refer implicitly to human CMV. 

Association of State Green Parties<====>71644<====>Association of State Green Parties The Association of State Green Parties was an organization of state Green Parties in the United States between 1996 and 2001.   In 2001, it evolved into the Green Party of the United States. FoundingIn the aftermath of the first Green presidential campaign in 1996, 62 Greens from 30 states gathered over the weekend of November 16–17, 1996 to found the Association of State Green Parties (ASGP).  The meeting was held at the historic Glen-Ora Farm in Middleburg, Virginia where John Kennedy had his weekend retreat in his administration's early days (rented to the president by the mother of ASGP meeting host and Nader supporter Elaine Broadhead. 

Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol<====>71649<====>Challenge-Handshake Authentication ProtocolIn computing, the Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) authenticates a user or network host to an authenticating entity.  That entity may be, for example, an Internet service provider.  CHAP is specified in  . CHAP provides protection against replay attacks by the peer through the use of an incrementally changing identifier and of a variable challenge-value.  CHAP requires that both the client and server know the plaintext of the secret, although it is never sent over the network.   Thus, CHAP provides better security as compared to Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) which is vulnerable for both these reasons. 

Password Authentication Protocol<====>71663<====>Password Authentication ProtocolPassword Authentication Protocol (PAP) is a password-based authentication protocol used by Point to Point Protocol (PPP) to validate users.   Almost all network operating system remote servers support PAP. PAP is considered a weak authentication scheme (weak schemes are simple and have lighter computational overhead but are much more vulnerable to attack; while weak schemes may have limited application in some constrained environments, they are avoided in general).  Among PAP's deficiencies is the fact that it transmits unencrypted passwords over the network.  PAP is therefore used only as a last resort when the remote server does not support a stronger scheme such as CHAP or EAP. 

Personal Computer Memory Card International Association<====>71668<====>Personal Computer Memory Card International AssociationThe Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) was a group of computer hardware manufacturers, operating under that name from 1989 to 2009/2010.  Starting with the eponymous PCMCIA card in 1990, it created various standards for peripheral interfaces designed for laptop computers. HistoryThe PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) industry organization was based on the original initiative of the British mathematician and computer scientist Ian Cullimore,    one of the founders of the Sunnyvale-based Poqet Computer Corporation,  who was seeking to integrate some kind of memory card technology as storage medium into their early DOS-based palmtop PCs,  when traditional floppy drives and harddisks were found to be too power-hungry and large to fit into their battery-powered handheld devices.

Dinner<====>71691<====>Dinner   Dinner usually refers to the most significant meal of the day, which can be at noon or in the evening.  However, the term "dinner" can have different meanings depending on culture, as it may mean a meal of any size eaten at any time of day.   Historically, it referred to the first meal of the day eaten around noon,    and is still sometimes used for a noon-time meal, particularly if it is a large or main meal.  In many parts of the Western world, dinner is taken as the evening meal. 

First Intifada<====>71712<====>First IntifadaThe First Intifada or First Palestinian Intifada  (also known simply as the intifada or intifadah ) was a Palestinian uprising against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.

Second Intifada<====>71717<====>Second Intifada  The Second Intifada, also  known as the Al-Aqsa Intifada (   ;   Intifādat El-Aqtzah), was the second Palestinian uprising against Israel – a period of intensified Israeli–Palestinian violence.  It started in September 2000, when Ariel Sharon made a visit to the Temple Mount, seen by Palestinians as highly provocative; and Palestinian demonstrators, throwing stones at police, were dispersed by the Israeli army, using tear gas and rubber bullets.  Both parties caused high numbers of casualties among civilians as well as combatants: the Palestinians by numerous suicide bombings and gunfire; the Israelis by tank and gunfire and air attacks, by numerous targeted killings, and by reactions to demonstrations. 

Polygraph<====>71734<====>Polygraph   A polygraph, popularly referred to as a lie detector, measures and records several physiological indices such as blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and skin conductivity while the subject is asked and answers a series of questions.   The belief underpinning the use of the polygraph is that deceptive answers will produce physiological responses that can be differentiated from those associated with non-deceptive answers. The polygraph was invented in 1921 by John Augustus Larson, a medical student at the University of California, Berkeley and a police officer of the Berkeley Police Department in Berkeley, California.   The polygraph was on the Encyclopædia Britannica 2003 list of greatest inventions, described as inventions that "have had profound effects on human life for better or worse. 

Hugo Steinhaus<====>71735<====>Hugo Steinhaus Władysław Hugo Dionizy Steinhaus   (January 14, 1887 – February 25, 1972) was a Polish mathematician and educator.  Steinhaus obtained his PhD under David Hilbert at Göttingen University in 1911 and later became a professor at the Jan Kazimierz University in Lwów (now Lviv, Ukraine), where he helped establish what later became known as the Lwów School of Mathematics.  He is credited with "discovering" mathematician Stefan Banach, with whom he gave a notable contribution to functional analysis through the Banach–Steinhaus theorem.  After World War II Steinhaus played an important part in the establishment of the mathematics department at Wrocław University and in the revival of Polish mathematics from the destruction of the war. 

Fruit machine (homosexuality test)<====>71750<====>Fruit machine (homosexuality test) "Fruit machine" is a term for a device developed in Canada by Frank Robert Wake   that was supposed to be able to identify gay men (derogatorily referred to as "fruits").  The subjects were made to view pornography; the device then measured the diameter of the pupils of the eyes (pupillary response test), perspiration, and pulse for a supposed erotic response. The "fruit machine" was employed in Canada in the 1950s and 1960s during a campaign to eliminate all gay men from the civil service, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), and the military. 

Tuskegee Airmen<====>71753<====>Tuskegee AirmenThe Tuskegee Airmen   is the popular name of a group of African-American military pilots (fighter and bomber) who fought in World War II.

Hollow-point bullet<====>71758<====>Hollow-point bullet A hollow-point bullet is an expanding bullet that has a pit or hollowed out shape in its tip often intended to cause the bullet to expand upon entering a target in order to decrease penetration and disrupt more tissue as it travels through the target.  It is also used for controlled penetration, where over-penetration could cause collateral damage (such as aboard an aircraft).  In target shooting, they are used for greater accuracy and reduction of smoke, fouling, and lead vapor exposure, as hollow point bullets have an enclosed base while traditional bullets have an exposed lead base.

He is best known for his work on quantum mechanics in the early 1920s, providing the foundation for Bose–Einstein statistics and the theory of the Bose–Einstein condensate.  A Fellow of the Royal Society, he was awarded India's second highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan in 1954 by the Government of India.    The class of particles that obey Bose–Einstein statistics, bosons, was named after Bose by Paul Dirac. 

Mara Jade<====>71789<====>Mara Jade  Mara Jade Skywalker is a fictional character in Star Wars expanded universe books, comic books, and computer games.  She is the wife of Luke Skywalker and mother of Ben Skywalker.  In the different video games, she is voiced by Heidi Shannon, Edie Mirman and Kath Soucie. Concept and developmentMara Jade was introduced in Timothy Zahn's Heir to the Empire (1991).  Zahn imagined Jade as a strong, complex female character, which he found was lacking in the Star Wars universe.  While competent, she is also flawed.   When the Thrawn Trilogy ended in 1993 with The Last Command, Zahn thought it was the last book for which he would develop the character. 

Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man<====>71791<====>Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man is a novel by Siegfried Sassoon, first published in 1928 by Faber and Faber.   It won both the Hawthornden Prize and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, being immediately recognised as a classic of English literature.   In the years since its first appearance, it has regularly been a set text for British schoolchildren.  BackgroundPrior to its publication, Siegfried Sassoon's reputation rested entirely on his poetry, mostly written during and about World War I.   Only ten years after the war ended, after some experience of journalism, did he feel ready to branch out into prose. 

Daniel Boone<====>71792<====>Daniel Boone  Daniel Boone (  September 26, 1820) was an American pioneer, explorer,  woodsman, and frontiersman, whose frontier exploits made him one of the first folk heroes of the United States.  Boone is most famous for his exploration and settlement of what is now Kentucky, which was then part of Virginia but on the other side of the mountains from the settled areas.   As a young adult, Boone supplemented his farm income by hunting and trapping game, and selling their pelts in the fur market.   Through this occupational interest, Boone first learned the easy routes to the area.

Most belong to the House of Grimaldi; exceptions, which consist primarily of the principality's administrators under periods of foreign occupation, are noted. History The House of Grimaldi, descended from Otto Canella, a Genoese statesman, and taking their name from his son Grimaldo, were an ancient and prominent Guelphic Genoese family.  Members of this family, in the course of the civil strife in Genoa between the Guelphs and Ghibellines, were banned from Genoa in 1271 and took refuge in Monaco. François Grimaldi seized the Rock of Monaco in 1297, starting the Grimaldi dynasty, under the sovereignty of the Republic of Genoa. 

Women's United Soccer Association<====>71808<====>Women's United Soccer Association The Women's United Soccer Association, often abbreviated to the WUSA, was the world's first women's soccer league in which all the players were paid as professionals.  Founded in February 2000, the league began its first season in April 2001 with eight teams in the United States.  The league suspended operations on September 15, 2003, shortly after the end of its third season, after making cumulative losses of around US $100 million.  HistoryEstablishmentAs a result of the US Women's National Team's (US WNT) first-place showing in the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup, a seemingly viable market for the sport germinated. 

Accrington F.C.<====>71812<====>Accrington F. C.Accrington Football Club was an English football club from Accrington, Lancashire, who were one of the founder members of The Football League. HistoryAccrington F. C.  was formed following a meeting at a local public house in 1876.  The Owd Reds played at Accrington Cricket Club's ground in Thorneyholme Road, still in use for that sport today.  The club was part of the revolt against the Football Association in 1884 over professionalism, after being expelled from the FA the previous year for paying a player.  They were one of the original twelve teams forming the Football League on 17 April 1888.

That gained them entry to the Football League Third Division South in time for 1921–22.  Aberdare spent six seasons in the League, with their best season being 1921–22, when they finished 8th. 

Corned beef<====>71831<====>Corned beef   Corned beef is a salt-cured beef product.  The term comes from the treatment of the meat with large grained rock salt, also called "corns" of salt.  It features as an ingredient in many cuisines.  Most recipes include nitrates or nitrites, which convert the natural myoglobin in beef to nitrosomyoglobin, giving a pink color.  Nitrates and nitrites reduce the risk of dangerous botulism during curing by inhibiting the growth of Clostridium botulinum spores.   Beef cured with salt only has a gray color and is sometimes called "New England corned beef".  Often, sugar and spices are also added to recipes for corned beef.

Alfred Dreyfus<====>71839<====>Alfred Dreyfus   Alfred Dreyfus ( ; 9 October 1859 – 12 July 1935) was a French Jewish artillery officer whose trial and conviction in 1894 on charges of treason became one of the most tense political dramas in modern French history with a wide echo in all Europe.  Known today as the Dreyfus affair, the incident eventually ended with Dreyfus's complete exoneration. Captain Alfred Dreyfus's grandchildren donated over three thousand documents to the Musée d'art et d'histoire du judaïsme (Museum of Jewish art and history), including personal letters, photographs of the trial, legal documents, writings by Dreyfus during his time in prison, personal family photographs, and his officer stripes that were ripped out as a symbol of treason. 

Oscar the Grouch<====>71849<====>Oscar the Grouch  Oscar the Grouch is a character on the television program Sesame Street.  He has a green body, no visible nose, and lives in a trash can.

Lady Eleanor Talbot<====>71859<====>Lady Eleanor TalbotLady Eleanor Talbot (  – 30 June 1468), also known by her married name Eleanor Butler, was a daughter of John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury.  After the death of Edward IV of England it was claimed by his brother Richard, the future Richard III, that she had had a legal precontract of marriage to Edward, which invalidated the king's later marriage to Elizabeth Woodville.  According to Richard, this meant that he, rather than Edward's sons, was the true heir to the throne.  Richard took the crown and imprisoned Edward's sons, who subsequently disappeared. 

Titulus Regius<====>71861<====>Titulus Regius    ("royal title" in Latin) is a statute of the Parliament of England, issued in 1484, by which the title of King of England was given to Richard III. The act ratifies the declaration of the lords and the members of the House of Commons, in the year before, that the marriage of Edward IV of England to Elizabeth Woodville had been invalid, and consequently their children, including Edward, Richard and Elizabeth, were illegitimate and, therefore, debarred from the throne.  Thus Richard III had been proclaimed the rightful king.  But as the Lords and Commons had not been officially convened as a parliament, doubts had arisen as to its validity, so when Parliament convened it enacted the declaration as a law. 

Liguria<====>71864<====>Liguria Liguria ( ,    ) is a coastal region of north-western Italy; its capital is Genoa.  The region is popular with tourists for its beaches, towns and cuisine. EtymologyThe name Liguria predates Latin and is of obscure origin, however the Latin adjectives Ligusticum (as in Mare Ligusticum) and Liguscus  reveal the original -sc- in the root ligusc-, which shortened to -s- and turned into -r- in the Latin name Liguria according to rhotacism.  The formant -sc- (-sk-) is present in the names Etruscan, Basque, Gascony and is believed by some researchers to relate to maritime people or sailors.

Butlerian Jihad<====>71873<====>Butlerian Jihad  The Butlerian Jihad is an event in the back-story of Frank Herbert's fictional Dune universe.   Occurring over 10,000 years before the events chronicled in his 1965 novel Dune, this jihad leads to the outlawing of certain technologies, primarily "thinking machines," a collective term for computers and artificial intelligence of any kind.   This prohibition is a key influence on the nature of Herbert's fictional setting.  Writing for The New Yorker, Jon Michaud praises Herbert's "clever authorial decision" to excise robots and computers ("two staples of the genre") from his fictional universe, but suggests that this may be one explanation why Dune lacks "true fandom among science-fiction fans" to the extent that it "has not penetrated popular culture in the way that The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars have".

Federal Information Processing Standard state code<====>71880<====>Federal Information Processing Standard state codeFIPS state codes were numeric and two-letter alphabetic codes defined in  U. S.  Federal Information Processing Standard Publication ("FIPS PUB") 5-2 to identify U. S.  states and certain other associated areas.  The standard superseded FIPS PUB 5-1 on May 28, 1987, and was superseded on September 2, 2008, by ANSI standard INCITS 38:2009.  The codes are used in Geographic Names Information System, overseen by the U. S.  Board on Geographic Names.  The codes were assigned by NIST and each uniquely identified a state, the District of Columbia, or an outlying area of the U. 

FIPS county code<====>71882<====>FIPS county codeThe Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 6-4 (FIPS 6-4) was a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards code which uniquely identified counties and county equivalents in the United States, certain U. S.  possessions, and certain freely associated states. On September 2, 2008, the US Department of Commerce, following three years of review and comments from "public, research communities, manufacturers, voluntary standards organizations, and Federal, State, and local government organizations", announced that FIPS 6-4 was one of ten FIPS standards withdrawn by the department`s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).Deemed "obsolete, or have not been updated to adopt current voluntary industry standards, federal specifications, federal data standards, or current good practices for information security",  the NIST replaced FIPS 6-4 with "INCITS 31 – 2009" codes for the "Identification of the States and Equivalent Areas within the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Insular Areas".

Israeli authorities have called Barghouti a terrorist, accusing him of directing numerous attacks, including suicide bombings, against civilian and military targets alike. 

Amazon Standard Identification Number<====>71898<====>Amazon Standard Identification Number  The Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN) is a 10-character alphanumeric unique identifier assigned by Amazon. com and its partners for product identification within the Amazon organization.  Usage and structureAlthough ASINs used to be unique worldwide, global expansion has changed things so that ASINs are only guaranteed unique within a marketplace.   The same product may be referred to by several ASINs though, and different national sites may use a different ASIN for the same product.   In general, ASINs are likely to be different between the country sites unless they are for a class of product where the ASIN is based on an externally defined and internationally consistent identifier, such as ISBN for books.

Natural Color System<====>71917<====>Natural Color System The Natural Color System (NCS) is a proprietary perceptual color model.  It is based on the color opponency hypothesis of color vision, first proposed by German physiologist Ewald Hering.   The current version of the NCS was developed by the Swedish Colour Centre Foundation, from 1964 onwards.  The research team consisted of Anders Hård, Lars Sivik and Gunnar Tonnquist, who in 1997 received the AIC Judd award for their work. The system is based entirely on the phenomenology of human perception and not on color mixing.  It is illustrated by a color atlas, marketed by NCS Colour AB in Stockholm.

The term is the nominalised plural of  , with Volksdeutsche denoting a singular female, and Volksdeutsche(r), a singular male.  The words Volk and völkisch conveyed the meanings of "folk" and "race" while adding the sense of superior civilisation and blood.

Jack Johnson (boxer)<====>71965<====>Jack Johnson (boxer)   John Arthur "Jack" Johnson (March 31, 1878 – June 10, 1946), nicknamed the Galveston Giant, was an American boxer who, at the height of the Jim Crow era, became the first African American world heavyweight boxing champion (1908–1915).  Among the period's most dominant champions, Johnson remains a boxing legend, with his 1910 fight against James J.  Jeffries dubbed the "fight of the century. " John L.  Sullivan, cited in: Christopher James Shelton, Historian for The Boxing Amusement Park, "'Fight of the Century' Johnson vs.  Jeffries, the 100th anniversary" In 1912, Johnson was arrested on fabricated charges of violating the Mann Act—forbidding one to transport a woman across state lines for "immoral purposes"—a racially motivated charge that embroiled him in controversy for his relationships, including marriages, with white women. 

Nine Inch Nails<====>71966<====>Nine Inch Nails   Nine Inch Nails, commonly abbreviated as NIN (stylized as NIИ), is an American industrial band founded in 1988 by Trent Reznor in Cleveland, Ohio.

Despite its success, the band has had several feuds with the corporate side of the recording industry.  The first was its notable conflict with TVT Records regarding the band's first album, Pretty Hate Machine, which led Reznor to record his follow-up album in secrecy to avoid the label's influence. 

École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne<====>71968<====>École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne{{Location map| Switzerland| caption    = Location: Lausanne, Switzerland| width = 250| label = EPFL| label-size = 90| background = #DDDD44| position   = top| lat_deg    = 46| lat_min    = 31  The roots of modern-day EPFL can be traced back to the foundation of a private school under the name École spéciale de Lausanne in 1853 at the initiative of Lois Rivier, a graduate of the École Centrale Paris and John Gay, the then professor and rector of the Académie de Lausanne. At its inception it had only 11 students and the offices was located at Rue du Valentin in Lausanne. In 1869, it became the technical department of the public Académie de Lausanne. When the Académie was reorganised and acquired the status of a university in 1890, the technical faculty changed its name to École d'ingénieurs de l'Université de Lausanne. In 1946, it was renamed the École polytechnique de l'Université de Lausanne (EPUL). In 1969, the EPUL was separated from the rest of the University of Lausanne and became a federal institute under its current name. EPFL, like ETH Zurich, is thus directly controlled by the Swiss federal government. In contrast, all other universities in Switzerland are controlled by their respective cantonal governments. Following the nomination of Patrick Aebischer as president in 2000, EPFL has started to develop into the field of life sciences. It absorbed the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research (ISREC) in 2008. In 1946, there were 360 students. In 1969, EPFL had 1,400 students and 55 professors. In the past two decades the university has grown rapidly and as of 2012 roughly 14,000 people study or work on campus, about 9,300 of these being Bachelor, Master or PhD students. As EPFL first became a federal institute under its current name in 1969, with a student body of then less than 1500, the university is included in the Times Higher Education list of top 100 universities under 50 years old. The environment at modern day EPFL is highly international with the school now attracting top students and researchers from all over the world. More than 125 countries are represented on the campus and the university has two official languages, French and English.Admission and educationLike every public university in Switzerland, EPFL is obliged to grant admission to every Swiss resident who took the maturité high-school certificate recognized by the Swiss Federation. However, international students are required to have a final grade average of 80% or above of the maximum grade of the upper secondary school national system. As such, for Swiss students, EPFL is not selective in its undergraduate admission procedures. The real selection process happens during the first year of study. This period is called the propaedeutic cycle and the students must pass a block examination of all the courses taken during the first year at the end of the cycle. If the weighted average is insufficient, a student is required to retake the entire first year of coursework if they wish to continue their studies at the school. Roughly 50% of students fail the first year of study, and many of them choose to drop out rather than repeat the first year.    The failure rate for the propaedeutic cycle differs between fields of study, it is highest for Mathematics, Physics and Electrical Engineering majors where only 30–40% of students pass the first year.For foreign students, the selection procedure towards the undergraduate program is rather strict, and since most undergraduate courses are taught in French, foreign students must provide documentation of having acquired a level B2 proficiency as measured on the CEF scale, though C1 proficiency is recommended.As at all universities in Switzerland, the academic year is divided into two semesters. Regular time to reach graduation is six semesters for the Bachelor of Science degree and four additional semesters for the Master of Science degree. Though only 58% of the student's who manage to graduate are able to graduate within this time-period.  The possibility to study abroad for one or two semesters is offered during the 3rd year of study under certain conditions as EPFL maintains several long-standing student exchange programs, such as the junior year engineering and science program with Carnegie Mellon University in the United States, as well as a graduate Aeronautics and Aerospace program with the ISAE in France. The final semester is dedicated to writing a thesis.Entrepreneurship is actively encouraged to foster a start-up culture among the student body as evident by the EPFL-Innovationpark being an integral part of campus. Since 1997, 12 start-ups have been created per year on average by EPFL students and faculty. In the year 2013, a total of 105 million CHF was raised by EPFL start-ups. Rankings The three most widely observed international university rankings, QS World University Rankings, Academic Ranking of World Universities and Times Higher Education World University Rankings ranks EPFL 5th, 2nd and 5th respectively in Europe in their 2017 rankings. In the rankings EPFL competes with Cambridge, Oxford, Imperial College London and its sister institution, ETH Zurich, for the European top five spots in Engineering and Technology.QS World University Ranking 2017/2018 ranks EPFL as the worlds 12th best university across all fields, and world 11th in the Natural Sciences subcategory.  Academic Ranking of World Universities 2016 ranks EPFL world 11th and Europe 2nd in the Engineering, Technology and Computer Sciences category.  THE World University Rankings 2016–2017 ranks EPFL world 11th in the Engineering and Technology subcategory. EPFL typically scores high on faculty to student ratio, international outlook and scientific impact. The specialized CWTS Leiden Ranking  that "aims to provide highly accurate measurements of the scientific impact of universities" ranks EPFL world 13th, and 1st in Europe in the 2013 rankings for all the sciences.  Although EPFL generally ranks among the worlds best universities on measures such as citation index, international outlook and scientific impact, due to the young age and small size of the school, it tends to rank comparatively low in name-brand surveys. A recent example of this being the Times 2017 reputation ranking where EPFL was ranked world 45th, comparatively low for EPFL.  In recent years, multiple EPFL faculty members have been selected as Young Global Leader or as Young Scientist by the World Economic Forum, increasing the visibility of EPFL outside tech-circles. The Times 100 Under 50 Rankings is a ranking of the top 100 universities in the world under 50 years old. Since EPFL in its current form was formed in 1969, EPFL is included in this ranking. EPFL was ranked 1st in the world for three years in a row in 2015,  2016    and 2017.  Times Higher Education also ranked EPFL as the most international university in the world two years in a row 2014  and 2015. Campus The École d'ingénieurs de l'Université de Lausanne, from which EPFL in its modern-day form originates, was located in the center of Lausanne. In 1974, five years after EPFL was separated from University of Lausanne and became a federal institute under its current name, the construction of a new campus at Dorigny in Écublens, a suburb south-west of Lausanne on the shores of Lake Geneva, began. The inauguration of the first EPFL buildings of the new campus took place in 1978.The EPFL campus has been evolving ever since. The first stage of the development plans, with a total budget of 462 million Swiss francs, was completed in 1984 and in 1990 the second stage was completed. The construction of the northern parts of campus began in 1995 with the construction of the Microtechnology building, completed in 1998, and the architecture building, completed in 2000. In 2002, the department of architecture also moved to the campus in Écublens, uniting all departments of EPFL on the same site. The latest addition to the EPFL campus is the Rolex Learning Center completed February 2010. The Rolex Learning Center includes areas for work, leisure and services and is located at the center of the campus. The EPFL campus is now being expanded with the construction of the SwissTech Convention Center to be completed in 2014.Together with the University of Lausanne, also located in Écublens, the EPFL forms a vast campus, welcoming about 20,000 students, at the shores of Lake Geneva. The campus is served by the Lausanne Metro Line 1 (M1) and is equipped with an electric bicycle sharing system.  Since 2012, only electricity from certified hydroelectric generation is being bought by EPFL to power its campus. EPFL was the first campus to receive the International Sustainable Campus Excellence Award by the International Sustainable Campus Network. Of the 14,000 people that work and study at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne campus, roughly 9.300 are students in either Bachelor, Master or Doctoral programs, the remaining 4,700 being administrative staff, scientists, technical staff, professors and the entrepreneurs located in the Science Park EPFL7. More than 125 nationalities are present on campus with 48% of the student population being foreign nationals. Almost all of the structures of the EPFL are located on its main campus. However, it also has branches in Neuchâtel ("Microcity"), in Sion ("Pôle EPFL Valais"),  in Geneva (Campus Biotech, including the Wyss Center for Bio- and Neuro-engineering) and in Fribourg ("Smart Living Lab").The EPFL also has a project of research centre in Ras al-Khaimah (United Arab Emirates), EPFL Middle East. BuildingsThe campus consists of about 65 buildings on  . Built according to the growth of the school, the campus includes different types of architectures:Late 1970s–1980s: modularised building, used today by the Schools of Basic Sciences and Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering1990s: buildings with institutes from the Schools of Engineering Sciences and Techniques, Computer and Communication Sciences, and the Scientific Park (PSE)Modern: new buildings (2002–2004) with Microengineering, Communications and Architecture institutes, the School of Life Sciences and the College of Management.The Learning Center, a new library (2010)2014: The SwissTech Convention Center and the "Quartier Nord" (convention center, student accommodation, shops...)The Artlab was opened in November 2016; it includes three spaces opened to the public. The first one hosts archives from the Montreux Jazz Festival; the second is a space for museum experimentations. The third space, named DataSquare, hosts an exposition on Big data, illustrated by two scientific projects from EPFL: the Human Brain Project and the Venice Time Machine.The EPFL and the University of Lausanne also share an active sports centre five minutes away from EPFL, on the shores of Lake Geneva.

Trail of Tears<====>71973<====>Trail of Tears   The Trail of Tears was a series of forced removals, sometimes at gunpoint, of Native American nations from their ancestral homelands in the Southeastern United States to other areas, one of which was an area West of the Mississippi River that had been designated as Indian Territory.  The forced relocations were carried out by government authorities following the passage of the Indian Removal Act in 1830.  Many of the relocated native people suffered from exposure, disease, and starvation while en route to their new designated reserve, and many died before reaching their various designated reserve(s). 

Hellraiser<====>71975<====>HellraiserHellraiser is a 1987 British horror film written and directed by Clive Barker, and produced by Christopher Figg, based on Barker's novella The Hellbound Heart.   The film marked Barker's directorial debut.   The film involves the resurrection of Frank (Sean Chapman), who had opened the door to an alternate dimension and had his body torn to pieces by creatures known as Cenobites.  Years later, Frank's brother Larry (Andrew Robinson) moves into their late mother's abandoned house with new wife, Julia (Clare Higgins).  An accident causes some of Larry's blood to spill on the attic floor, which somehow triggers Frank's resurrection.

Up Pompeii!<====>71984<====>Up Pompeii!  Up Pompeii! is a British television comedy series broadcast between 1969 and 1970, starring Frankie Howerd.  The first series was written by Talbot Rothwell, a scriptwriter for the Carry On films, and the second series by Rothwell and Sid Colin.  Two later specials were transmitted in 1975 and 1991. BackgroundUp Pompeii! began as a Comedy Playhouse.  Michael Mills and Tom Sloan, from BBC Comedy and Light Entertainment, were  visiting the ruins of Pompeii.  Since Mills had recently seen Frankie Howerd in the play A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum he casually remarked to Sloan that he half expected Frankie Howerd to appear coming round some corner. 

Stark spectroscopy<====>71986<====>Stark spectroscopy Stark spectroscopy (sometimes known as electroabsorption/emission spectroscopy) is a form of spectroscopy based on the Stark effect.  In brief, this technique makes use of the Stark effect (or electrochromism) either to reveal information about the physiochemical or physical properties of a sample using a well-characterized electric field or to reveal information about an electric field using a reference sample with a well-characterized Stark effect. The use of the term "Stark effect" differs between the disciplines of chemistry and physics.  Physicists tend to use the more classical definition of the term (see Stark effect), while chemists usually use the term to refer to what is technically electrochromism. 

Uncle Tom's Cabin<====>71989<====>Uncle Tom's Cabin  Uncle Tom's Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly,   is an anti-slavery novel by American author Harriet Beecher Stowe.

Genetic drift<====>72016<====>Genetic drift    Genetic drift (also known as allelic drift or the Sewall Wright effect  after biologist Sewall Wright) is the change in the frequency of an existing gene variant (allele) in a population due to random sampling of organisms.The alleles in the offspring are a sample of those in the parents, and chance has a role in determining whether a given individual survives and reproduces.  A population's allele frequency is the fraction of the copies of one gene that share a particular form.   Genetic drift may cause gene variants to disappear completely and thereby reduce genetic variation.

X-ray fluorescence<====>72048<====>X-ray fluorescenceX-ray fluorescence (XRF) is the emission of characteristic "secondary" (or fluorescent) X-rays from a material that has been excited by bombarding with high-energy X-rays or gamma rays.  The phenomenon is widely used for elemental analysis and chemical analysis, particularly in the investigation of metals, glass, ceramics and building materials, and for research in geochemistry, forensic science, archaeology and art objects  such as paintings  and murals. Underlying physicsWhen materials are exposed to short-wavelength X-rays or to gamma rays, ionization of their component atoms may take place.  Ionization consists of the ejection of one or more electrons from the atom, and may occur if the atom is exposed to radiation with an energy greater than its ionization energy. 

Wold Newton family<====>72066<====>Wold Newton family The Wold Newton family is a literary concept derived from a form of crossover fiction developed by the American science fiction writer Philip José Farmer.  Origins of the WN familyIn real life a meteorite, called the Wold Cottage meteorite, fell near Wold Newton, Yorkshire, England, on December 13, 1795.  Farmer suggested in two fictional biographies, Tarzan Alive: A Definitive Biography of Lord Greystoke (1972) and Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life (1973) that this meteorite caused genetic mutations in the occupants of two passing coaches due to ionization.  Many of their descendants were thus endowed with extremely high intelligence and strength, as well as an exceptional capacity and drive to perform good or, as the case may be, evil deeds.

Cinema of New Zealand<====>72147<====>Cinema of New Zealand    New Zealand cinema can refer to films made by New Zealand-based production companies in New Zealand.  However, it may also refer to films made about New Zealand by filmmakers from other countries.  Due to the comparatively small size of its film industry, New Zealand produces many films that are co-financed by overseas companies. The history of cinema in New Zealand is almost as long as the medium itself.  The first public screening of a motion picture took place in 1896.  A documentary made in 1900 is the oldest surviving New Zealand film, while the first feature film made in New Zealand premiered in 1914. 

Lokasenna<====>72150<====>Lokasenna Lokasenna ("Loki's flyting," "Loki's wrangling," "Loki's quarrel") is one of the poems of the Poetic Edda.  The poem presents flyting between the gods and Loki.

Human population planning<====>72156<====>Human population planning Human population planning is the practice of intentionally managing the rate of growth of a human population.  Historically human population planning has been implemented with the goal of increasing the rate of human population growth.  However, in the period from the 1950s to the 1980s, concerns about global population growth and its effects on poverty, environmental degradation and political stability led to efforts to reduce human population growth rates.  More recently, some countries, such as Iran and Spain, have begun efforts to increase their birth rates once again. While population planning can involve measures that improve people's lives by giving them greater control of their reproduction, a few programs, most notably the Chinese government's "one-child policy", have resorted to coercive measures. 

Environmental determinism<====>72161<====>Environmental determinism  Environmental determinism (also known as climatic determinism or geographical determinism) is the study of how the physical environment predisposes societies and states towards particular development trajectories.  Nineteenth century approaches held that climate and terrain largely determined human activity and psychology, and it was associated with institutionalized racism and eugenics.   Many scholars underscore that this approach supported colonialism and eurocentrism, and devalued human agency in non-Western societies.  Gilmartin, M.  (2009).  "Colonialism/Imperialism".

American Basketball Association<====>72163<====>American Basketball Association    The original American Basketball Association (ABA)  was a major-league professional basketball league founded in 1967.  The ABA ceased to exist with the American Basketball Association–National Basketball Association merger in 1976, leading several teams to join the National Basketball Association and the introduction of the 3-point shot in the NBA. League history The ABA was conceived at a time stretching from 1960 through the mid-1970s when numerous upstart leagues were challenging, with varying degrees of success, the established major professional sports leagues in the United States.  Basketball was seen as particularly vulnerable to a challenge; its major league, the National Basketball Association, was the youngest of the Big Four major leagues, having only played 21 seasons to that point, and was still fending off contemporary challenging leagues (it had been less than five years since the American Basketball League (ABL) shut down).

He was buried at St.  Peter's parish church in the village of Hever.  His parents were Sir William Boleyn (1451 – 10 October 1505) and Lady Margaret Butler (1454–1539), daughter and co-heiress of Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond. 

Work for hire<====>72168<====>Work for hireIn the copyright law of the United States, a work made for hire (work for hire or WFH) is a work subject to copyright that is created by an employee as part of his job, or some limited types of works for which all parties agree in writing to the WFH designation.  Work for hire is a statutorily defined term (17 U. S. C.  § 101), so a work for hire is not created merely because parties to an agreement state that the work is a work for hire.   It is an exception to the general rule that the person who actually creates a work is the legally recognized author of that work. 

Time control<====>72171<====>Time controlA time control is a mechanism in the tournament play of almost all two-player board games so that each round of the match can finish in a timely way and the tournament can proceed.   Time controls are typically enforced by means of a game clock.  Time pressure (or time trouble or zeitnot) is the situation of having very little time on a player's clock to complete their remaining moves. In the case of chess, the World Chess Federation FIDE has a single, classical time control for most of its major events, 90 minutes for the first 40 moves, followed by 30 minutes for the rest of the game, with an addition of 30 seconds per move starting from move one. 

Thomas Wyatt (poet)<====>72173<====>Thomas Wyatt (poet)   Sir Thomas Wyatt (1503 – 11 October 1542)  was a 16th-century English politician, ambassador, and lyric poet credited with introducing the sonnet to English literature.

Plywood<====>72227<====>Plywood Plywood is a sheet material manufactured from thin layers or "plies" of wood veneer that are glued together with adjacent layers having their wood grain rotated up to 90 degrees to one another.  It is an engineered wood from the family of manufactured boards which includes medium-density fibreboard (MDF) and particle board (chipboard).  All plywoods bind resin and wood fibre sheets (cellulose cells are long, strong and thin) to form a composite material.  This alternation of the grain is called cross-graining and has several important benefits: it reduces the tendency of wood to split when nailed in at the edges; it reduces expansion and shrinkage, providing improved dimensional stability; and it makes the strength of the panel consistent across all directions.

He came to the throne after his brother King Akaba.  During his reign, Dahomey expanded significantly and took control of key trade routes for the Atlantic slave trade by conquering Allada (1724) and Whydah (1727).

King Agaja had significantly expanded the Kingdom of Dahomey during his reign, notably conquering Allada in 1724 and Whydah in 1727.   This increased the size of the kingdom and increased both domestic dissent (with the royal aristocrats of both Allada and Whydah opposing Dahomey from fortified islands off the coast) and regional opposition (mainly with semi-regular warfare between Dahomey and the Oyo Empire). 

Kpengla<====>72444<====>Kpengla Kpengla was a King of the Kingdom of Dahomey, in present-day Benin, from 1774 until 1789.   Kpengla followed his father Tegbessou to the throne and much of his administration was defined by the increasing Atlantic slave trade and regional rivalry over the profits from this trade.   His attempts to control the slave trade generally failed, and when he died of smallpox in 1789, his son Agonglo came to the throne and ended many of his policies. Rise to powerThe Kingdom of Dahomey had increased significantly in power since the 1720s.   King Agaja (1718-1740) had expanded the kingdom to the key Atlantic ports of Whydah and Allada. 

Agonglo<====>72445<====>Agonglo Agonglo was a King of the Kingdom of Dahomey, in present-day Benin, from 1789 until 1797.   Agonglo took over from his father King Kpengla in 1789 and inherited many of the economic problems that developed during Kpengla's reign.   Because of the poor economy, Agonglo was often constrained by domestic opposition.   As a response, he reformed many of the economic policies (lowered taxes and removed constrains on the slave trade) and did military expeditions to try to increase the supply for the Atlantic slave trade.   Many of these efforts were unsuccessful and European traders became less active in the ports of the kingdom. 

Jean-Pierre Rampal<====>72447<====>Jean-Pierre Rampal  Jean-Pierre Louis Rampal (7 January 1922 – 20 May 2000) was a French flautist.  He has been personally "credited with returning to the flute the popularity as a solo classical instrument it had not held since the 18th century. " BiographyEarly yearsBorn in Marseille, the only child of Andrée (née Roggero) and flautist Joseph Rampal, Jean-Pierre Rampal became the first exponent of the solo flute in modern times to establish it on the international concert circuit, and to attract acclaim and large audiences comparable to those enjoyed by celebrity singers, pianists, and violinists.  As it was unusual for solo flute to be featured widely in orchestral concerts, this was not easily done in the immediate years after World War II; however, Rampal's flair and presence—he was a big man to wield such a slim instrument—paved the way for the next generation of flautist superstars such as James Galway and Emmanuel Pahud. 

Adandozan<====>72448<====>Adandozan Adandozan was a King of the Kingdom of Dahomey, in present-day Benin, from 1797 until 1818.   His rule ended with a coup by his brother Ghezo who then erased Adandozan from the official history resulting in high uncertainty about many aspects of his life.   Adandozan took over from his father Agonglo in 1797 but was quite young at the time and so there was a regent in charge of the kingdom until 1804.   Dealing with the economic depression that had defined the administrations of his father Agonglo and grandfather Kpengla, Adandozan tried to increase slave raiding, increase European trade, and when these failed reform the economy to focus on agriculture. 

Ibero-Caucasian languages<====>72449<====>Ibero-Caucasian languages The term Ibero-Caucasian (or Iberian-Caucasian) was proposed by Georgian linguist Arnold Chikobava for the union of the three language families that are specific to the Caucasus, namelySouth Caucasian, also called Kartvelian. Northwest Caucasian, also called CircassianNortheast Caucasian, also called Nakho–Dagestanian. The Ibero-Caucasian phylum would also include three extinct languages: Hattic, connected by some linguists to the Northwest (Circassian) family, and Hurrian and Urartian, connected to the Northeast (Nakh–Dagestanian) family. Family statusThe affinities between the three families are disputed.   A connection between the Northeast and Northwest families is seen as likely by many linguists; see the article on the North Caucasian languages for details. 

Ghezo<====>72451<====>Ghezo  Ghezo or Gezo was King of the Dahomey, in present-day Benin, from 1818 until 1858.  Ghezo replaced his brother Adandozan (who ruled from 1797 to 1818) as king through a coup with the assistance of the Brazilian slave trader Francisco Félix de Sousa.  He ruled over the kingdom during a tumultuous period, punctuated by the British blockade of the ports of Dahomey in order to stop the Atlantic slave trade.  Ghezo finally ended Dahomey's tributary status to the Oyo empire but also dealt with significant domestic dissent and pressure from the British to end the slave trade. 

Glele<====>72452<====>GleleGlele or Badohou (died 1889) was the tenth King of Dahomey, ruling from 1858 until his death. LifeBadohou, who took the throne name Glele, is considered (if Adandozan is not counted) to be the tenth King of the Aja kingdom of Dahomey (part of modern-day Benin).He succeeded his father, Ghezo, and ruled from 1858 to 1889.  Glele continued his father's successful war campaigns, in part to avenge his father's death, in part to capture slaves.  During his rule he sustained Dahomey's renaissance as a center of palm oil sales and slave trade.   Glele also signed treaties with the French, who had previously acquired a concession in Porto-Novo from its king.

Béhanzin was Abomey's last independent ruler established through traditional power structures.  He led the national resistance during the Dahomey War. His symbols are the shark, the egg (a rebus of his name), and a captive hanging from a flagpole (a reference to a boastful and rebellious Nago practitioner of harmful magic from Ketou whom the king hanged from a flagpole as punishment for his pride). 

Oswald von Wolkenstein<====>72459<====>Oswald von WolkensteinOswald von Wolkenstein (1376 or 1377, presumably in Castle Schöneck in Kiens – August 2, 1445 in Merano) was a poet, composer and diplomat.

He was dubbed a Knight of the Holy Sepulchre and was also inducted into the Order of the Jar and the Order of the Dragon.  He lived for a time in Seis am Schlern. LifeOswald's father was Friedrich von Wolkenstein and his mother Katharina von Villanders.  When he was ten years old, Oswald left his family and became squire of a knight errant. 

Northwest Caucasian languages<====>72462<====>Northwest Caucasian languages   The Northwest Caucasian languages,  also called West Caucasian, Abkhazo-Adyghean, Circassic, or sometimes Pontic (as opposed to Caspian for the Northeast Caucasian languages), are a group of languages spoken in the northwestern Caucasus region, Hoiberg, Dale H.

Agoli-agbo<====>72463<====>Agoli-agbo Agoli-agbo is considered to have been the twelfth and final King of Dahomey.   He took the throne after the previous king, Béhanzin, went into exile after a failed war with France.   He was in power from 1894 to 1900. The exile of Béhanzin did not legalize the French colonization.  The French general Alfred Dodds offered the throne to every one of the immediate royal family, in return for a signature on a treaty establishing a French protectorate over the Kingdom; all refused.  Finally, Béhanzin's Army Chief of Staff Prince Agoli-agbo, brother of Béhanzin and son of King Glélé, signed.

They are a common feature of river deltas.  The phenomenon is known as river bifurcation.  The opposite of a distributary is a tributary.  Distributaries usually occur as a stream nears a lake or an ocean, but they can occur inland as well, such as on alluvial fans or when a tributary stream bifurcates as it nears its confluence with a larger stream.  In some cases, a minor distributary can divert so much water from the main channel that it can become the main route.

Electron energy loss spectroscopy<====>72489<====>Electron energy loss spectroscopy In electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) a material is exposed to a beam of electrons with a known, narrow range of kinetic energies.  Some of the electrons will undergo inelastic scattering, which means that they lose energy and have their paths slightly and randomly deflected.   The amount of energy loss can be measured via an electron spectrometer and interpreted in terms of what caused the energy loss.   Inelastic interactions include phonon excitations, inter- and intra-band transitions, plasmon excitations, inner shell ionizations, and Cherenkov radiation.   The inner-shell ionizations are particularly useful for detecting the elemental components of a material.

Thermal conduction<====>72536<====>Thermal conductionThermal conduction is the transfer of heat (internal energy) by microscopic collisions  of particles and movement of electrons within a body.  The microscopically colliding objects, that include molecules, atoms, and electrons, transfer disorganized microscopic kinetic and potential energy, jointly known as internal energy.  Conduction takes place in all phases of matter, including solids, liquids, gases and waves.   The rate at which energy is conducted as heat between two bodies is a function of the temperature difference (temperature gradient) between the two bodies and the properties of the conductive medium through which the heat is transferred. 

List of premiers of the Northwest Territories<====>72539<====>List of premiers of the Northwest Territories  The Premier of the Northwest Territories is a title given to the head of government in the Northwest Territories of Canada when the territory is using an elected system of responsible government.  Throughout its history, the territory has been governed by various combinations of locally elected governments and administrators appointed by the federal government of Canada. Upon creation, the Northwest Territories were governed by Manitoba's Lieutenant Governor, a representative of the federal government and the Queen of Canada for the newly created province of Manitoba.  Six years later in 1876, the territory was given its own Lieutenant Governor, separate from that of Manitoba. 

Newton (unit)<====>72540<====>Newton (unit)   The newton (symbol: N) is the International System of Units (SI) derived unit of force.  It is named after Isaac Newton in recognition of his work on classical mechanics, specifically Newton's second law of motion. See below for the conversion factors. DefinitionOne newton is the force needed to accelerate one kilogram of mass at the rate of one metre per second squared in direction of the applied force. In 1946, Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM) Resolution 2 standardized the unit of force in the MKS system of units to be the amount needed to accelerate 1 kilogram of mass at the rate of 1 metre per second squared. 

Hygelac<====>72542<====>Hygelac Hygelac ( ;  ;  ;   (Lexicon of Nordic Personal Names Before the 8th Century); from hyg "courage" and -lac.    ; died   521 ) was a king of the Geats according to the poem Beowulf.   It is Hygelac's presence in the poem which has allowed scholars to tentatively date the setting of the poem as well as to infer that it contains at least some points of historical fact.Beowulf gives Hygelac's genealogy: according to the poem, he was the son of Hrethel and had two brothers Herebeald and Hæþcyn, as well as an unnamed sister who was married to Ecgtheow and mother of the hero Beowulf.

Sound bite<====>72554<====>Sound biteA sound bite is a short clip of speech or music extracted from a longer piece of audio, often used to promote or exemplify the full length piece.  In the context of journalism, a sound bite is characterized by a short phrase or sentence that captures the essence of what the speaker was trying to say, and is used to summarize information and entice the reader or viewer.  The term was coined by the U. S.  media in the 1970s.  Since then, politicians have increasingly employed sound bites to summarize their positions. Due to its brevity, the sound bite often overshadows the broader context in which it was spoken, and can be misleading or inaccurate. 

Peta-<====>72561<====>Peta-  Peta   is a decimal unit prefix in the metric system denoting multiplication by 10 15  ( ).  It was adopted as an SI prefix in the International System of Units in 1975,  and has the symbol P. Peta is derived from the Greek  , meaning "five".  It denotes the fifth power of 1000 (1000 5 ).  It is similar to the prefix penta ("five"), but without the letter n (on the analogy of the prefix tera (from the Greek for "monster") for 1000 4  looking like tetra- ("four") with a letter missing).

The pieces are mostly bawdy, irreverent, and satirical.  They were written principally in Medieval Latin; a few in Middle High German, and some with traces of Old French.  Some are macaronic, a mixture of Latin and German or French vernacular. They were written by students and clergy when the Latin idiom was the lingua franca across Italy and western Europe for travelling scholars, universities and theologians. 

Passy Cemetery<====>72567<====>Passy Cemetery   Passy Cemetery ( ) is a cemetery in Passy, in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, France. HistoryThe current cemetery replaced the old cemetery (l'ancien cimetière communal de Passy, located on Rue Lekain), which was closed in 1802. In the early 19th century, on the orders of Napoleon I, Emperor of the French, all the cemeteries in Paris were replaced by several large new ones outside the precincts of the capital.  Montmartre Cemetery was built in the north, Père Lachaise Cemetery in the east, and Montparnasse Cemetery in the south.  Passy Cemetery was a later addition, but has its origins in the same edict.

He graduated with a bachelor's degree from the California Institute of Technology, pursued graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, and received a PhD in theoretical physics from Cornell University in 1954. 

Axial precession<====>72576<====>Axial precession In astronomy, axial precession is a gravity-induced, slow, and continuous change in the orientation of an astronomical body's rotational axis.  In particular, it can refer to the gradual shift in the orientation of Earth's axis of rotation, which, similar to a wobbling top, traces out a pair of cones joined at their apices in a cycle of approximately 26,000 years.   The term "precession" typically refers only to this largest part of the motion; other changes in the alignment of Earth's axis—nutation and polar motion—are much smaller in magnitude. Earth's precession was historically called the precession of the equinoxes, because the equinoxes moved westward along the ecliptic relative to the fixed stars, opposite to the yearly motion of the Sun along the ecliptic. 

Joab<====>72578<====>Joab Joab (Hebrew    Modern  Yo'av  Tiberian  Yôʼāḇ) the son of Zeruiah, was the nephew of King David and the commander of his army, according to the Hebrew Bible. NameThe name Joab is derived from Yahweh ( ), the name of the God of Israel, and the Hebrew word 'av' ( ), meaning 'father'.  It therefore means 'Yahweh [is] father'.  Apart from David's nephew, the name is given to two other individuals in the Bible   (see Ezra 2:6, 8:9).  Those are the descendants of Joab of Bethlehem the son of Zeruiah; the subject is of the house and head of the house. 

Arminius<====>72581<====>Arminius  Arminius (German: Hermann; 18/17 BC – AD 21) was a chieftain of the Germanic Cherusci tribe who famously led an allied coalition of Germanic tribes to a decisive victory against three Roman legions in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD.  An auxiliary lieutenant to the Roman general Publius Quinctilius Varus, Arminius used his knowledge of Roman tactics to ambush and destroy the legions. The defeat at Teutoburg would precipitate the Roman Empire's permanent strategic withdrawal from Magna Germania, and the Romans made no more concerted attempts to conquer and hold Germania beyond the Rhine river. 

Environmental geology<====>72584<====>Environmental geologyEnvironmental geology, like hydrogeology, is an applied science concerned with the practical application of the principles of geology in the solving of environmental problems.  It is a multidisciplinary field that is closely related to engineering geology and, to a lesser extent, to environmental geography.  Each of these fields involves the study of the interaction of humans with the geologic environment, including the biosphere, the lithosphere, the hydrosphere, and to some extent the atmosphere.  In other words, environmental geology is the application of geological information to solve conflicts, minimizing possible adverse environmental degradation or maximizing possible advantageous condition resulting from the use of natural and modified environment. 

Weathering<====>72585<====>Weathering  Weathering  is the breaking down of rocks, soil, and minerals as well as wood and artificial materials through contact with the Earth's atmosphere, waters, and biological organisms.  Weathering occurs in situ (on site), that is, in the same place, with little or no movement, and thus should not be confused with erosion, which involves the movement of rocks and minerals by agents such as water, ice, snow, wind, waves and gravity and then being transported and deposited in other locations. Two important classifications of weathering processes exist – physical and chemical weathering; each sometimes involves a biological component. 

Simon Stevin<====>72586<====>Simon Stevin Simon Stevin ( ; 1548–1620), sometimes called Stevinus, was a Flemish mathematician, physicist and military engineer.

He also translated various mathematical terms into Dutch, making it one of the few European languages in which the word for mathematics,   (  and  , i. e. , "the knowledge of what is certain"), was not a loanword from Greek but a calque via Latin. BiographyVery little is known with certainty about Stevin's life and what we know is mostly inferred from other recorded facts.

Rhine Falls<====>72696<====>Rhine Falls   The Rhine Falls ( , singular) is the largest waterfall in Switzerland, Europe.   The falls are located on the High Rhine on the border between the cantons of Schaffhausen (SH) and Zürich (ZH), between the municipalities of Neuhausen am Rheinfall (SH) and Laufen-Uhwiesen/Dachsen (ZH), next to the town of Schaffhausen in northern Switzerland. They are   wide and   high.  In the winter months, the average water flow is  , while in the summer, the average water flow is  .  The highest flow ever measured was   in 1965; and the lowest,   in 1921. 

Eric Dolphy<====>72697<====>Eric Dolphy Eric Allan Dolphy, Jr.  (June 20, 1928 – June 29, 1964) was an American jazz alto saxophonist, flautist, and bass clarinetist.  On a few occasions, he also played the clarinet and piccolo.  Dolphy was one of several multi-instrumentalists to gain prominence in the 1960s.  He was one of the first important bass clarinet soloists in jazz, extended the vocabulary and boundaries of the alto saxophone, and was among the earliest significant jazz flute soloists. His improvisational style was characterized by the use of wide intervals, in addition to using an array of extended techniques to emulate the sounds of human voices and animals. 

Tommaso Buscetta<====>72701<====>Tommaso Buscetta  Tommaso Buscetta ( ; 13 July 1928 – 2 April 2000 ) was an Italian gangster, a member of the Sicilian Mafia, who became the first Mafia boss to turn informant (pentito) and explain the inner workings of the organisation.  Buscetta participated in criminal activity in Italy, the United States and Brazil before being extradited to Italy, where he provided important testimony at the Maxi Trial, the largest anti-Mafia trial in history.  After the murder of the judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, Buscetta gave further testimony to the Antimafia Commission linking Italian politicians to the Mafia. 

Out-of-place artifact<====>72705<====>Out-of-place artifact An out-of-place artifact  (OOPArt) is an artifact of historical, archaeological, or paleontological interest found in an unusual context, that challenges conventional historical chronology by being "too advanced" for the level of civilization that existed at the time, or showing "human presence" before humans were known to exist. The term is rarely used by historians or scientists.  Its use is largely confined to cryptozoologists, proponents of ancient astronaut theories, Young Earth creationists, and paranormal enthusiasts.   The term is used to describe a wide variety of objects, from anomalies studied by mainstream science and pseudoarchaeology far outside the mainstream to objects that have been shown to be hoaxes or to have mundane explanations. 

Christian X of Denmark<====>72708<====>Christian X of Denmark  Christian X (Christian Carl Frederik Albert Alexander Vilhelm; 26 September 1870 – 20 April 1947) was King of Denmark from 1912 to 1947 and the only king of Iceland (where the name was officially Kristján X), between 1918 and 1944. He was a member of the House of Glücksburg and the first member of his family since king Frederick VII to have actually been born into the Danish royal family; both his father and his grandfather were born as princes of a German ducal family.  Among his siblings was King Haakon VII of Norway. His character as a ruler has been described as authoritarian and he strongly stressed the importance of royal dignity and power. 

Conceptual metaphor<====>72710<====>Conceptual metaphorIn cognitive linguistics, conceptual metaphor, or cognitive metaphor, refers to the understanding of one idea, or conceptual domain, in terms of another.  An example of this is the understanding of quantity in terms of directionality (e. g.  "the price of peace is rising"). A conceptual domain can be any coherent organization of human experience.  The regularity with which different languages employ the same metaphors, which often appear to be perceptually based, has led to the hypothesis that the mapping between conceptual domains corresponds to neural mappings in the brain.    This theory has gained wide attention, although some researchers question its empirical accuracy. 

Cognitive linguistics<====>72711<====>Cognitive linguistics  Cognitive linguistics (CL) an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics, combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics.  It describes how language interacts with cognition, how language forms our thoughts, and the evolution of language parallel with the change in the common mindset across time.  According to Merriam-Webster, the word "cognitive" is defined as "of, relating to, being, or involving conscious intellectual activity (such as thinking, reasoning, or remembering)".  Merriam-Webster also defines linguistics as "the study of human speech including the units, nature, structure, and modification of language".   Combining those two definitions together to form cognitive linguistics would provide the notion of the concepts and ideas discussed in the realm of CL. 

Iconicity<====>72712<====>Iconicity  In functional-cognitive linguistics, as well as in semiotics, iconicity is the conceived   or analogy between the form of a sign (linguistic or otherwise) and its meaning, as opposed to arbitrariness. Iconic principles:Quantity principle: conceptual complexity corresponds to formal complexityProximity principle: conceptual distance tends to match with linguistic distanceSequential order principle: the sequential order of events described is mirrored in the speech chainQuantity principleThe use of quantity of phonetic material to iconically mark increased quality or quantity can be noted in the lengthening of words to indicate a greater degree, such as " ".  It is also common to use reduplication to iconically mark increase, as Edward Sapir is quoted, “The process is generally employed, with self-evident symbolism, to indicate such concepts as distribution, plurality, repetition, customary activity, increase of size, added intensity, continuance” (1921:79). 

Metonymy<====>72715<====>Metonymy Metonymy ( ,  )  is a figure of speech in which a thing or concept is referred to by the name of something closely associated with that thing or concept.   EtymologyThe words metonymy and metonym come from the Greek μετωνυμία,  , "a change of name", from  ,  , "after, beyond", and  ,  , a suffix that names figures of speech, from  ,   or  ,  , "name".    IntroductionMetonymy and related figures of speech are common in everyday speech and writing.  Synecdoche and metalepsis are considered specific types of metonymy. 

Hari (Afghanistan)<====>72716<====>Hari (Afghanistan) The Heray Rud River (Dari: هری رود Hari Rūd, Heray Rūd, i. e.  "Herat River") is a river flowing   from the mountains of central Afghanistan to Turkmenistan, where it disappears in the Kara-Kum desert forming the Tejend oasis.  Rud means "river" in Persian. In Turkmenistan it is known as the Tejen or Tedzhen river and passes close to the city of Tedzhen.  Old books call it the Hari Rud.  To the Ancient Greeks it was known as the Arius.   In Latin, it was known as the Tarius. CourseThe river originates in the Baba mountain range, part of the Hindu Kush system, and follows a relatively straight course to the west. 

Categorization<====>72717<====>Categorization    Categorization is the process in which ideas and objects are recognized, differentiated, and understood.   Categorization implies that objects are grouped into categories, usually for some specific purpose.  Ideally, a category illuminates a relationship between the subjects and objects of knowledge.  Categorization is fundamental in language, prediction, inference, decision making and in all kinds of environmental interaction.  It is indicated that categorization plays a major role in computer programming.  There are many categorization theories and techniques.  In a broader historical view, however, three general approaches to categorization may be identified:Classical categorizationConceptual clusteringPrototype theoryThe classical view Classical categorization first appears in the context of Western Philosophy in the work of Plato, who, in his Statesman dialogue, introduces the approach of grouping objects based on their similar properties. 

Prototype<====>72718<====>Prototype  A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a product built to test a concept or process or to act as a thing to be replicated or learned from.It is a term used in a variety of contexts, including semantics, design, electronics, and software programming.  A prototype is generally used to evaluate a new design to enhance precision by system analysts and users.   Prototyping serves to provide specifications for a real, working system rather than a theoretical one.   In some design workflow models, creating a prototype (a process sometimes called materialization) is the step between the formalization and the evaluation of an idea. 

Beaked whale<====>72720<====>Beaked whale  Beaked whales are the members of the family Ziphiidae, which consists of 22 species.  These toothed whales are notable for their elongated beaks.  Among air-breathing animals, beaked whales are some of the most extreme divers: Cuvier's beaked whales regularly dive for an hour at a depth over  ,and the longest and deepest foraging dive recorded is 137. 5 minutes at  .  This is the greatest dive-depth known for a mammal.    Beaked whales are one of the least known groups of mammals because of their deep-sea habitat, mysterious habits, and apparent low abundance. 

Margaret Holland, Duchess of Clarence<====>72725<====>Margaret Holland, Duchess of Clarence Margaret Holland, Countess of Somerset (1385 – 31 December 1439) was the daughter of Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent, who was the son of Joan "the Fair Maid of Kent" (granddaughter of Edward I of England, wife of Edward the Black Prince and mother of Richard II of England).  Margaret's mother was Alice FitzAlan, daughter of Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel and Eleanor of Lancaster. Margaret married John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset, son of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster and his mistress Katherine Swynford.  They had six children: Henry Beaufort, 2nd Earl of Somerset (c. 

Thrust fault<====>72726<====>Thrust faultA thrust fault is a break in the Earth's crust, across which younger rocks are pushed above older rocks. Thrust geometry and nomenclatureReverse faultsA thrust fault is a type of reverse fault that has a dip of 45 degrees or less.  If the angle of the fault plane is lower (generally less than 20 degrees from the horizontal) and the displacement of the overlying block is large (often in the kilometer range) the fault is called an overthrust.    Erosion can remove part of the overlying block, creating a fenster (or window) – when the underlying block is exposed only in a relatively small area. 

Green Revolution<====>72727<====>Green Revolution    The Green Revolution refers to a set of research and the development of technology transfer initiatives occurring between the 1930s and the late 1960s (with prequels in the work of the agrarian geneticist Nazareno Strampelli in the 1920s and 1930s), that increased agricultural production worldwide, particularly in the developing world, beginning most markedly in the late 1960s.   The initiatives resulted in the adoption of new technologies, including: . . . new, high-yielding varieties (HYVs) of cereals, especially dwarf wheats and rices, in association with chemical fertilizers and agro-chemicals, and with controlled water-supply (usually involving irrigation) and new methods of cultivation, including mechanization. 

Earth Summit 2002<====>72728<====>Earth Summit 2002 The World Summit on Sustainable Development, WSSD or ONG Earth Summit 2002 took place in Johannesburg, South Africa, from 26 August to 4 September 2002.  It was convened to discuss sustainable development by the United Nations.  WSSD gathered a number of leaders from business and non-governmental organizations, 10 years after the first Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.  (It was therefore also informally nicknamed "Rio+10". )DeclarationsThe Johannesburg Declaration was the main outcome of the Summit; however, there were several other international agreements. It laid out the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation as an action plan. 

William Harvey Carney<====>72732<====>William Harvey Carney William Harvey Carney (February 29, 1840 – December 9, 1908)  was an African American soldier during the American Civil War.  In 1900, he was awarded the Medal of Honor for his gallantry in saving the regimental colors during the Battle of Fort Wagner in 1863.   Because his actions preceded those of other medal honorees, he is considered to be the first African American to be granted the Medal of Honor. BiographyWilliam H.  Carney was born as a slave in Norfolk, Virginia, on February 29, 1840.How he made his way to freedom is not certain.

Slave name<====>72740<====>Slave name A slave name is the personal name given by others to an enslaved person, or a name inherited from enslaved ancestors.  Modern use of the term applies mostly to African-Americans and West Indians descended from enslaved Africans who retain the name given to their ancestors by the enslavers. Changing from a slave name to a name embodying an African identity became common after emancipation by those in the African Diaspora seeking a reconnection to their cultural roots.  Ancient Rome In Rome slaves were given a single name by their owner.  A slave who was freed might keep his or her slave name and adopt the former owner's name as a praenomen and nomen.

Croesus<====>72745<====>Croesus Croesus  (   ;  , Kroisos; 595 BC – c.  546 BC) was the king of Lydia who, according to Herodotus, reigned for 14 years: from 560 BC until his defeat by the Persian king Cyrus the Great in 546 BC  (sometimes given as 547 BC). Croesus was renowned for his wealth; Herodotus and Pausanias noted that his gifts were preserved at Delphi.   The fall of Croesus made a profound impact on the Greeks, providing a fixed point in their calendar.  "By the fifth century at least," J. A. S.  Evans has remarked, "Croesus had become a figure of myth, who stood outside the conventional restraints of chronology. 

560 BC<====>72746<====>560 BC  The year 560 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.  In the Roman Empire, it was known as year 194 Ab urbe condita.The denomination 560 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

Organic farming<====>72754<====>Organic farming  Organic farming is an alternative agricultural system which originated early in the 20th century in reaction to rapidly changing farming practices.  Organic farming continues to be developed by various organic agriculture organizations today.  It relies on fertilizers of organic origin such as compost manure, green manure, and bone meal and places emphasis on techniques such as crop rotation and companion planting.  Biological pest control, mixed cropping and the fostering of insect predators are encouraged.  In general, organic standards are designed to allow the use of naturally occurring substances while prohibiting or strictly limiting synthetic substances.

Claw<====>72764<====>Claw  A claw is a curved, pointed appendage, found at the end of a toe or finger in most amniotes (mammals, reptiles, birds). Some invertebrates such as beetles and spiders have somewhat similar fine hooked structures at the end of the leg or tarsus for gripping a surface as the creature walks.  Crabs', lobsters' and scorpions' pincers, or more formally, their chelae, are sometimes called claws. A true claw is made of hard protein called keratin.  Claws are used to catch and hold prey in carnivorous mammals such as cats and dogs, but may also be used for such purposes as digging, climbing trees, self-defense, and grooming, in those and other species.

Fundamentalists argued that 19th-century modernist theologians had misinterpreted or rejected certain doctrines, especially biblical inerrancy, that they viewed as the fundamentals of the Christian faith.  Sandeen (1970), p.  6  Fundamentalists are almost always described as having a literal interpretation of the Bible.  A few scholars regard Catholics who reject modern theology in favor of more traditional doctrines as fundamentalists.

Canonical LR parser<====>73056<====>Canonical LR parserIn computer science, a canonical LR parser or LR(1) parser is an LR(k) parser for k=1, i. e.  with a single lookahead terminal.  The special attribute of this parser is that any LR(k) grammar with k>1 can be transformed into an LR(1) grammar.It can handle all deterministic context-free languages.    In the past this LR(k) parser has been avoided because of its huge memory requirements in favor of less powerful alternatives such as the LALR and the LL(1) parser.  Recently, however, a "minimal LR(1) parser" whose space requirements are close to LALR parsers, is being offered by several parser generators.

Church of the SubGenius<====>73068<====>Church of the SubGeniusThe Church of the SubGenius is a parody religion that satirizes better-known belief systems.  It teaches a complex philosophy that focuses on J.  R.  "Bob" Dobbs, purportedly a salesman from the 1950s, who is revered as a prophet by the Church.  SubGenius leaders have developed detailed narratives about Dobbs and his relationship to various gods and conspiracies.  Their central deity, Jehovah 1, is accompanied by other gods drawn from ancient mythology and popular fiction.  SubGenius literature describes a grand conspiracy that seeks to brainwash the world and oppress Dobbs' followers.  In its narratives, the Church presents a blend of cultural references in an elaborate remix of the sources.

Surface weather analysis<====>73218<====>Surface weather analysisSurface weather analysis is a special type of weather map that provides a view of weather elements over a geographical area at a specified time based on information from ground-based weather stations.  Weather maps are created by plotting or tracing the values of relevant quantities such as sea level pressure, temperature, and cloud cover onto a geographical map to help find synoptic scale features such as weather fronts. The first weather maps in the 19th century were drawn well after the fact to help devise a theory on storm systems.  Eric R.  Miller.  American Pioneers in Meteorology.

J (programming language)<====>73227<====>J (programming language)  The J programming language, developed in the early 1990s by Kenneth E.  Iverson and Roger Hui,   is a synthesis of APL (also by Iverson) and the FP and FL function-level languages created by John Backus.  To avoid repeating the APL special-character problem, J uses only the basic ASCII character set, resorting to the use of the dot and colon as inflections  to form short words similar to digraphs.  Most such "primary" (or "primitive") J words serve as mathematical symbols, with the dot or colon extending the meaning of the basic characters available. 

Weather forecasting<====>73231<====>Weather forecasting  Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time.  Human beings have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since the 19th century.  Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere at a given place and using meteorology to project how the atmosphere will change. Once a human-only endeavor based mainly upon changes in barometric pressure, current weather conditions, and sky condition, weather forecasting now relies on computer-based models that take many atmospheric factors into account.

Birthday problem<====>73242<====>Birthday problem In probability theory, the birthday problem or birthday paradox concerns the probability that, in a set of   randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday.  By the pigeonhole principle, the probability reaches 100% when the number of people reaches 367 (since there are only 366 possible birthdays, including February 29).  However, 99. 9% probability is reached with just 70 people, and 50% probability with 23 people.  These conclusions are based on the assumption that each day of the year (excluding February 29) is equally probable for a birthday. This logic has applications, for example a cryptographic attack called the birthday attack, which uses this probabilistic model to reduce the complexity of finding a collision for a hash function.

Historically, the name "Tacoma Narrows Bridge" has applied to the original bridge nicknamed "Galloping Gertie", which opened in July 1940, but collapsed because of aeroelastic flutter four months later, as well as the replacement of the original bridge which opened in 1950 and still stands today as the westbound lanes of the present-day twin bridge complex. 

Avalanche<====>73321<====>Avalanche An avalanche (also called a snowslide) is a rapid flow of snow down a sloping surface.  Avalanches are typically triggered in a starting zone from a mechanical failure in the snowpack (slab avalanche) when the forces on the snow exceed its strength but sometimes only with gradually widening (loose snow avalanche).  After initiation, avalanches usually accelerate rapidly and grow in mass and volume as they entrain more snow.  If the avalanche moves fast enough some of the snow may mix with the air forming a powder snow avalanche, which is a type of gravity current. Slides of rocks or debris, behaving in a similar way to snow, are also referred to as avalanches (see rockslide ).

EPROM<====>73333<====>EPROM  An EPROM (rarely EROM), or erasable programmable read-only memory, is a type of memory chip that retains its data when its power supply is switched off.  Computer memory that can retrieve stored data after a power supply has been turned off and back on is called non-volatile.   It is an array of floating-gate transistors individually programmed by an electronic device that supplies higher voltages than those normally used in digital circuits.   Once programmed, an EPROM can be erased by exposing it to strong ultraviolet light source (such as from a mercury-vapor light).  EPROMs are easily recognizable by the transparent fused quartz window in the top of the package, through which the silicon chip is visible, and which permits exposure to ultraviolet light during erasing. 

Battle of Benevento<====>73334<====>Battle of Benevento  The Battle of Benevento was fought on 26 February 1266 near Benevento, in present-day Southern Italy.  It was waged between the troops of Charles of Anjou and Manfred of Sicily.  Manfred's defeat and death resulted in the capture of the Kingdom of Sicily by Charles, effectively ending the rule of the Hohenstaufen in the Italian Peninsula. Background The Papacy had long been in conflict with the imperial house of Hohenstaufen over their rule in Italy.  At the time of the battle, the Hohenstaufen ruler in the Kingdom of Sicily (which included Sicily and southern Italy) was Manfred, illegitimate son of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor.

Depending on the Displaywrite version, the document files use . DOC or . TXT file name extension.  The Displaywrite software can export to and import from pure DCA/RFT files (which typically have . DCA or . RFT file name extension). 

Disjunctive normal form<====>73341<====>Disjunctive normal form In boolean logic, a disjunctive normal form (DNF) is a standardization (or normalization) of a logical formula which is a disjunction of conjunctive clauses; it can also be described as an OR of ANDs, a sum of products, or (in philosophical logic) a cluster concept.   As a normal form, it is useful in automated theorem proving. DefinitionA logical formula is considered to be in DNF if and only if it is a disjunction of one or more conjunctions of one or more literals.  A DNF formula is in full disjunctive normal form if each of its variables appears exactly once in every conjunction. 

Conjunctive normal form<====>73342<====>Conjunctive normal formIn Boolean logic, a formula is in conjunctive normal form (CNF) or clausal normal form if it is a conjunction of one or more clauses, where a clause is a disjunction of literals; otherwise put, it is an AND of ORs.  As a normal form, it is useful in automated theorem proving.  It is similar to the product of sums form used in circuit theory. All conjunctions of literals and all disjunctions of literals are in CNF, as they can be seen as conjunctions of one-literal clauses and conjunctions of a single clause, respectively.  As in the disjunctive normal form (DNF), the only propositional connectives a formula in CNF can contain are and, or, and not.

All the leaves on one section of branch grow in length together.  In the cabbage, new leaves are folded over, each covered by the previous leaf.  Circinate vernation Circinate vernation is the manner in which a fern frond emerges.   As the fern frond is formed, it is  tightly curled so that the tender growing tip of the frond (and each subdivision of the frond) is protected within a coil.

Feature creep<====>73528<====>Feature creep  Feature creep, creeping featurism or featuritis is the ongoing expansion or addition of new features in a product,    especially in computer software and consumer and business electronics.

CausesThe most common cause of feature creep is the desire to provide the consumer with a more useful or desirable product, in order to increase sales or distribution.  However, once the product reaches the point at which it does everything that it is designed to do, the manufacturer is left with the choice of adding unneeded functions, sometimes at the cost of efficiency, or sticking with the old version, at the cost of a perceived lack of improvement.

Elision<====>73648<====>Elision   In linguistics, an elision or deletion is the omission of one or more sounds (such as a vowel, a consonant, or a whole syllable) in a word or phrase.

In English as spoken by native speakers, elisions come naturally, and are often described as "slurred" or "muted" sounds.  Often, elisions are deliberate.   It is a common misconception that contractions automatically qualify as elided words, which comes from slack definitions: not all elided words are contractions and not all contractions are elided words (for example, 'going to' → 'gonna': an elision that is not a contraction; 'can not' → 'cannot': a contraction that is not an elision).

Scotch (adjective)<====>73679<====>Scotch (adjective)  Scotch is an adjective meaning "of Scotland".

"Scotch" applied to people is widely considered pejorative in Scotland, reflecting old Anglo-Scottish antagonisms, but it is still occasionally used in England and Ireland, though the usage is considered old-fashioned,  and is in common use in North America.  The verb to scotch is unrelated to the adjective.  It derives from Anglo-French escocher meaning "to notch, nick", from coche, "a notch, groove", extended in English to mean "to put an abrupt end to", with the forms "scotched", "scotching", "scotches".

Up to the 9th century it consisted of several independent major kingdoms (Lúighne, Uí Maine, and Iarthar Connacht). Between the reigns of Conchobar mac Taidg Mór (died 882) and his descendant, Aedh mac Ruaidri Ó Conchobair (reigned 1228–33), it became a kingdom under the rule of the Uí Briúin Aí dynasty, whose ruling sept adopted the surname Ua Conchobair.  At its greatest extent, it incorporated the often independent Kingdom of Breifne, as well as vassalage from the lordships of western Mide and west Leinster.

While still captive he was overthrown in a palace coup, and when released he was quickly defeated and detained by members of the Doukas family. 

Stork<====>74202<====>Stork  Storks are large, long-legged, long-necked wading birds with long, stout bills.  They belong to the family called Ciconiidae, and make up the order Ciconiiformes.  Ciconiiformes previously included a number of other families, such as herons and ibises, but those families have been moved to other orders.  Storks dwell in many regions and tend to live in drier habitats than the closely related herons, spoonbills and ibises; they also lack the powder down that those groups use to clean off fish slime.  Bill-clattering is an important mode of communication at the nest.  Many species are migratory. 

Leinster<====>74203<====>Leinster  Leinster (  —   —   /  ) is one of the Provinces of Ireland situated in the east of Ireland.  It comprises the ancient Kingdoms of Mide, Osraige and Leinster.   Following the 12th-century Norman invasion of Ireland, the historic fifths of Leinster and Mide gradually merged, mainly due to the impact of the Pale, which straddled both, thereby forming the present-day province of Leinster.  The ancient kingdoms were shired  into a number of counties for administrative and judicial purposes.  In later centuries, local government legislation has seen further sub-division of the historic counties. 

Locust<====>74204<====>Locust  Locusts are certain species of short-horned grasshoppers in the family Acrididae that have a swarming phase.  These insects are usually solitary, but under certain circumstances they become more abundant and change their behaviour and habits, becoming gregarious.   No taxonomic distinction is made between locust and grasshopper species; the basis for the definition is whether a species forms swarms under intermittently suitable conditions. In the solitary phase, these grasshoppers are innocuous, their numbers are low, and they do not pose a major economic threat to agriculture.  However, under suitable conditions of drought followed by rapid vegetation growth, serotonin in their brains triggers a dramatic set of changes: they start to breed abundantly, becoming gregarious and nomadic (loosely described as migratory) when their populations become dense enough.

John has been assessed as the greatest of the Komnenian emperors. 

South China Sea<====>74209<====>South China Sea   The South China Sea is a marginal sea that is part of the Pacific Ocean, encompassing an area from the Karimata and Malacca Straits to the Strait of Taiwan of around  .  The sea carries tremendous strategic importance; one-third of the world's shipping passes through it carrying over $3 trillion in trade each year,  it contains lucrative fisheries that are crucial for the food security of millions in Southeast Asia, and huge oil and gas reserves are believed to lie beneath its seabed.  According to International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition (1953), it is located south of China;east of Vietnam;west of the Philippines;east of the Malay peninsula and Sumatra, up to the Strait of Singapore in the western, andnorth of the Bangka Belitung Islands and BorneoHowever, in its unapproved draft 4th edition (1986),  IHO proposed the Natuna Sea, thus the South China Sea southern boundary was shifted northward, from north of Bangka Belitung Islands tonorth and northeast of Natuna Islands.

Based heavily on the Volkswagen Beetle, it was prototyped as the Type 62, but eventually became known internally as the Type 82. Kübelwagen is an abbreviation of Kübelsitzwagen, meaning "bucket-seat car" because all German light military vehicles that had no doors were fitted with bucket seats to prevent passengers from falling out .

Natural History (Pliny)<====>74215<====>Natural History (Pliny)Pliny's Natural History ( ) is a book about the whole of the natural world in Latin by Pliny the Elder, a Roman author and naval commander who died in 79 AD. It is one of the largest single works to have survived from the Roman Empire to the modern day and purports to cover all ancient knowledge.  The work's subject area is thus not limited to what is today understood by natural history; Pliny himself defines his scope as "the natural world, or life".   It is encyclopedic in scope, but its structure is not like that of a modern encyclopedia.

The first fire of the Olympic Winter Games was introduced at the IV Olympic Winter Games 1936 in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. In contrast to the Olympic flame proper, the torch relay of modern times, which transports the flame from Greece to the various designated sites of the games, had no ancient precedent and was introduced by Carl Diem at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin.

Presbyter<====>74222<====>Presbyter Presbyter (Greek πρεσβύτερος: "elder") in the New Testament refers to a leader in local Christian congregations, with presbyter being from the Greek  "presbyteros" and meaning elder/senior.  The word episkopos means (literally) overseer, referring exclusively to the office of bishop.  Presbyteros is understood by many as referring to the same person functioning as overseer.

Tailplane<====>74235<====>Tailplane A tailplane, also known as a horizontal stabiliser, is a small lifting surface located on the tail (empennage) behind the main lifting surfaces of a fixed-wing aircraft as well as other non-fixed-wing aircraft such as helicopters and gyroplanes.   Not all fixed-wing aircraft have tailplanes.  Canards, tailless and flying wing aircraft have no separate tailplane, while in v-tail aircraft the vertical stabilizer, rudder, and the tail-plane and elevator are combined to form two diagonal surfaces in a V layout. The function of the tailplane is to provide stability and control.  In particular, the tailplane helps adjust for changes in position of the center of pressure or center of gravity caused by changes in speed and attitude, fuel consumption, or dropping cargo or payload. 

Candela per square metre<====>74238<====>Candela per square metre The candela per square metre (cd/m 2 ) is the derived SI unit of luminance.  The unit is based on the candela, the SI unit of luminous intensity, and the square metre, the SI unit of area.  Nit (nt) is a non-SI name also used for this unit (1 nt = 1 cd/m 2 ).

Frame of reference<====>74263<====>Frame of reference   In physics, a frame of reference (or reference frame) consists of an abstract coordinate system and the set of physical reference points that uniquely fix (locate and orient) the coordinate system and standardize measurements. In n dimensions, n+1 reference points are sufficient to fully define a reference frame.  Using rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates, a reference frame may be defined with a reference point at the origin and a reference point at one unit distance along each of the n coordinate axes. In Einsteinian relativity, reference frames are used to specify the relationship between a moving observer and the phenomenon or phenomena under observation.

Hardware description language<====>74554<====>Hardware description language In electronics, a hardware description language (HDL) is a specialized computer language used to describe the structure and behavior of electronic circuits, and most commonly, digital logic circuits. A hardware description language enables a precise, formal description of an electronic circuit that allows for the automated analysis and simulation of an electronic circuit.  It also allows for the synthesis of a HDL description into a netlist (a specification of physical electronic components and how they are connected together), which can then be placed and routed to produce the set of masks used to create an integrated circuit. 

Acne<====>74555<====>Acne Acne, also known as acne vulgaris, is a long-term skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin.

Dynamic random-access memory<====>74567<====>Dynamic random-access memory  Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) is a type of  random access semiconductor memory that stores each bit of data in a separate tiny capacitor within an integrated circuit.  The capacitor can either be charged or discharged; these two states are taken to represent the two values of a bit, conventionally called 0 and 1.   The electric charge on the capacitors slowly leaks off, so without intervention the data on the chip would soon be lost.   To prevent this, DRAM requires an external memory refresh circuit which periodically rewrites the data in the capacitors, restoring them to their original charge.

National Socialist black metal<====>74572<====>National Socialist black metal  National Socialist black metal (NSBM), sometimes called Aryan black metal or neo-Nazi black metal, is black metal music that promotes Nazism or similar ideologies.  It typically melds neo-Nazi ideology with  ethnic European paganism and opposition to "foreign" religions such as Christianity, Islam and Judaism.  However, some artists are Satanists or occultists, rather than pagans.  NSBM is not seen as a distinct genre, but as a neo-völkisch movement within black metal.  According to Mattias Gardell, NSBM musicians see this ideology as "a logical extension of the political and spiritual dissidence inherent in black metal".
